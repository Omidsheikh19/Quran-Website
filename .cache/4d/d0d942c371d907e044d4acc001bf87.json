[72:27] Only to a messenger that He chooses, does He reveal from the past and the future, specific news.\r\n                            1:14\r\n                            [72:28] This is to ascertain that they have delivered their Lord's messages. He is fully aware of what they have. He has counted the numbers of all things.\r\n                            1:25\r\n                            Verse 19, [72:19] When GOD's servant advocated Him alone, almost all of them banded together to oppose him.\r\n                            1:35\r\n                            All of God's servants have said the same thing and say the same thing \"worship God alone.\"\r\n                            1:44\r\n                            They never asked that people worship them, follow them, do as they do, act as they do, speak as they do. They only say \"worship God alone, no other idols beside Him.\"\r\n                            2:00\r\n                            Why people become uncomfortable with the message  is we know the reason but it's  \r\n                            2:06\r\n                            still a puzzle when we run into people who  seem uncomfortable with that statement  \r\n                            2:12\r\n                            we all have family and old friends and colleagues who are surprised by us when we state that message and state that that's what we believe.\r\n                            2:24\r\n                            There are verses in the Quran and one in particular which says that when God alone is advocated, the hearts of disbelievers shrink in aversion and you can watch that  \r\n                            2:34\r\n                            happen. It is though people shrink. They become smaller almost in a very real sense. And it's their ego that gets in the way. It's here. Something so simple as God alone is so frightening to so many people. They believe that they have to have control and they have to understand and they have to know and they have to be the one who calls the shots.\r\n                            3:01\r\n                            In addition to that, if someone like themselves is saying  this message, it's an excuse and an easy way to avoid the message for many people. Again, the ego takes over and will say\r\n                            3:15\r\n                            \"why this person? I'm no different from this person or that person is no better than me. I don't have to listen to them.\" And so the message is rejected. We are fortunate enough, and I mean  \r\n                            3:30\r\n                            very fortunate enough. Speaking for myself, I have no idea why I was chosen to be here in Tucson. I know how I came. I can relate that story to...\r\n                            3:41\r\n                            but there are many of us who have the same story to tell. I know why I am very fortunate to  \r\n                            3:50\r\n                            be here where this perpetual miracle  continues to unravel before our eyes.\r\n                            3:58\r\n                            Rashad said the other day that he didn't... God has thickened our skin over the last 10 years and if we don't\r\n                            4:06\r\n                            faint or lose consciousness every time something like this incredible numbers on the wall or the things that Abdullah explained today or explained to us. We just sit here. Now we nod our heads and some of us get teary but we stay conscious\r\n                            4:21\r\n                            And we say \"oh, this is just more of the same.\" And I went home, my own self today is saying \"it seems that no matter what we do with the numbers, they're always gonna be a multiple of 19.\"\r\n                            4:31\r\n                            And that the complexity of this code is so great that it can never be understood by us. And that's why it's given in piece after piece after piece. And so many of us, how fortunate, are able to be part of discovering another part of the prism.\r\n                            4:49\r\n                            The message is \"worship God alone.\" It's so loud at this point that it's almost hard to pay attention to those people who don't wanna listen to the most elementary statement of \"worship God alone.\"\r\n                            5:05\r\n                            The servants of God carry the message \"I worship  only my Lord. I never set up any idols beside Him.\"\r\n                            5:15\r\n                            They also always say \"I am a human being like you. Do not worship me.\" And they point out their humanness. \"I possess no power to  \r\n                            5:27\r\n                            harm you nor to guide you. No one can protect me from  God, nor can I find any other refuge besides Him.\"\r\n                            5:34\r\n                            \"I am a human like you. I make no superhuman claims. I have no magic.\" Because, however, the servants of God have been given special information\r\n                            5:45\r\n                            and special (unintelligible), they're more vulnerable and their  responsibility is even greater than for those of us who have not had that opportunity, who have not been chosen. And also the servants of God, and Rashad is a wonderful\r\n                            6:01\r\n                            example but so were the others in the Quran, are also less vulnerable because God protects these people. And we've seen that all the way through Quran, Moses, Jesus, all of them, Elias, John. They've all been protected by God as long as they carried the one message.\r\n                            6:17\r\n                            They never claimed to be anything more than a messenger. So, the humanist is constantly poor people  and still they shrink and still they say  \r\n                            6:28\r\n                            to the message, messenger, when it was Noah, was Rashad, or he or you \"Uh-uh, who're you? You're a human being. You don't bring anything special. And I don't see any miracle.\" Well, It's a sorting process, thank God it is. It is always a place where pattern never changes.\r\n                            6:49\r\n                            Verse 23 [72:23] \"I'm here to deliver proclamations from God as well as His messages.\" Those who disobey GOD and His messenger incur the fire of Hell, wherein they abide forever.\r\n                            7:00\r\n                            The only unforgivable sin is idol worship, the only. And God is so clear that we have so many chances. As long as we live, we have chances to repent and to come back to God and get on God's path.\r\n                            7:14\r\n                            If we worship anything other than God, anyone other than God, God never will forgive this. This verse is not a threat by a human being, by a messenger.\r\n                            7:26\r\n                            This is from God Almighty saying always within Quran, whether it is a quote out of a messenger's mouth in a verse or whether it is a description in a narrative.\r\n                            7:38\r\n                            Hell is where the idol worshippers will go.\r\n                            7:45\r\n                            Once they see what is awaiting them, they will find out who's really weaker in power and fewer in number. It's too late. It is.  \r\n                            7:54\r\n                            Once you see it's too late if an angel was sent down with all of this wonderful stuff that we don't lose consciousness over every week, we wouldn't have needed any of it.\r\n                            8:08\r\n                            It's too late once you know. Rashad was talking about the fact the other day that people know at the time of their deaths where they're going. It is too late\r\n                            8:18\r\n                            for people to say \"let me go back. Let me have a second chance. I understand now what I'm supposed to do.\"\r\n                            8:24\r\n                            No, because God knows that once we're put back here, we revert to the same thing, the same forgetful mind that we came here with in the first place. And the phrase \"who is really weaker in power and fewer in number\"\r\n                            8:37\r\n                            we know that it is the minority of the minority of the minority, I mean, it's as long as a tunnel into the few that will make it into Heaven as it is in this code itself. It seems to be a mirror image.\r\n                            8:52\r\n                            Those few people that do make it even to Purgatory, that's, if you're hanging on by your toe nails in Purgatory, you made it. Those few people are really the strong ones, they're really the mightier in number. No matter how else it appears, but it counts in the real world.\r\n                            9:13\r\n                            [72:25] \"I do not know if what is promised to you will happen soon, or if my Lord will delay it for awhile.\" [72:26] He is the Knower of the future; He does not reveal the future to anyone.\r\n                            9:24\r\n                            Again, pointing to the fact that all messengers are human beings. They are not God. Only God knows the past, the future. We read history books and think that we have history. We think we understand what's happening. I'm willing to bet anything\r\n                            9:41\r\n                            that in the Hereafter when we discover what history really was in that whatever particular era that we think we know so much about,\r\n                            9:49\r\n                            all the little details that we didn't have access to. It's going to be vastly different and much (unintelligible), at the same time. I have... when I was reading this over this past week, I wrote that human being does not have  \r\n                            10:04\r\n                            any idea what he wants. The human being doesn't know the future. Jesus didn’t know the future. Jesus doesn’t know this is happening now. We know who were them, Noah, Jesus, Moses and all of those that have gone before us sitting in this room. We know them well.\r\n                            10:23\r\n                            We have all the pieces, I think, unless (unintelligible), I mean,\r\n                            10:29\r\n                            we have so much more. How much greater is our responsibility? How much more less we have to search? I mean, this is irrefutable proof, touchable, examinable, verifiable. We have all the miracles that have gone for those who came after Noah. We know that now. Noah doesn't. We know about those who came after Moses and Moses doesn't\r\n                            10:53\r\n                            The human being doesn't know what he thinks he knows. What he is, he makes up. His own security is made up. And to predict the future is foolish. It's absolutely foolish.\r\n                            11:08\r\n                            [72:27] Only to the messenger that He chooses, does He reveal from the past and the future, specific news.\r\n                            11:14\r\n                            Other examples besides Rashad's own experiences, Joseph knew about the future. It was revealed to him that his father and mother and brothers would bow down to him later in life and he knew that even after his experience in the well and in prison.\r\n                            11:33\r\n                            Moses' mother was given information about him being saved and what would become of him.\r\n                            11:42\r\n                            Those are tests. Those are provisions for God's very special messengers. They remove the doubts of those chosen by God who are going to be delivering the message and facing incredible odds\r\n                            11:56\r\n                            and provide for insights for believers when they are doubting themselves and they have this ammunition put at their disposal. When Joseph announced to the people \"I knew this was going to happen, you were going to be here, you were going to bow down.\"\r\n                            12:13\r\n                            There had to be more than just \"oh thank God, he's not  gonna kill us\" in their minds. These people had to have understood God chose Joseph and this was all part of the plan for Joseph.\r\n                            12:28\r\n                            God tells us in 28 that He gives specific news and specific information to ascertain, make sure the messengers have delivered their Lord's  \r\n                            12:36\r\n                            messages, that they've done it correctly.  He's fully aware of what He has given them  \r\n                            12:42\r\n                            to deliver and He has counted the  numbers of all thing. It's already done.\r\n                            12:49\r\n                            Counting the numbers of all things always makes me think of the Khutba that Abdullah gave when he was talking about the trees and the leaves and the numbers of the leaves on trees and he got... at least for me, I got very\r\n                            13:01\r\n                            involved in counting the leaves of the one tree that he was describing and when he got all done with that, it took very long time. He moved on to just one other tree. It was awesome at that point to even contemplate counting. So, that reminds all of the words that we speak and we receive with our ears and see with our eyes.\r\n                            13:23\r\n                            And those things are all designed ahead of time. We think which we are choosing the words we're saying or not, it's part of the design for our lives to test to be efficient for all of us.\r\n                            13:35\r\n                            The messenger has the greatest responsibility of all of us due to the large quantity of proof provided to him. And that can be awesome and frightening.\r\n                            13:49\r\n                            Unless, of course, the messenger knows that he's fully supported by Allah alone in which case this is (unintelligible) lifetime\r\n                            13:58\r\n                            I can't imagine (unintelligible). I wanted to share with you before I stopped at this section talking about\r\n                            14:08\r\n                            messengers and God's servants. I overheard  someone say, in trying to make a joke  \r\n                            14:13\r\n                            recently, that their favorite saying was that God so loved  the world He sent His only son. He didn't send a committee. And I remember... as I walked by, I  \r\n                            14:23\r\n                            remember just kind of shuddering thinking \"oh, yes, He did send a committee, a large committee of messengers and servants with many more to come (unintelligible).\"\r\n                            14:37\r\n                            And I thought I would share that with you because there are many people who think that there's no committee around here. There's such a large committee ranges alone.\r\n                            14:48\r\n                            And therefore, (unintelligible). Are there any comments, questions, I hope? \r\n                            15:12\r\n                            It's different. These pages are from the new translation. Now, all of us have them. There weren't enough  copies to go around. This is... the book that you're  \r\n                            15:22\r\n                            using is the most recent. This one is going to be published very soon. And it's going to be the first time when the correct Quran has been in human hands in 1400 years.\r\n                            15:34\r\n                            So, we're opting to use the few pages until book comes out. You might wanna share with someone.\r\n                            15:50\r\n                            No, absolutely not. but says the same thing. Says \"worship God alone.\"\r\n                            16:15\r\n                            The messenger: It's a long story. But it comes true as we explain these verses.\r\n                            16:21\r\n                            Why are we here. Why are we here. He wants to know why we're here.\r\n                            16:33\r\n                            (Unintelligible).\r\n                            16:43\r\n                            Mã Shã Allãh. Mã Shã Allãh. We're here, maybe, because we committed a crime.\r\n                            16:52\r\n                            When we were in the Heavenly Society, we sided with Satan. Satan wanted to be a god besides God and we did not oppose that. We did not make a good, firm stand with God, absolutely free.\r\n                            17:08\r\n                            So, this is why we're here to redeem ourselves and to change our way and denounce that stand by going back to upholding God's absolute authority\r\n                            17:18\r\n                            by knowing that nobody has any power  to do anything except God. This is God's absolute authority.\r\n                            17:25\r\n                            People who think that Muhammad or Jesus or Mary or saints can do anything are in the same trap of committing the same crime and they will go on all the way to Hell.\r\n                            17:36\r\n                            We can be redeemed only if we change that and worship God alone. \"Worship God alone\" means knowing that God only has power to do anything.\r\n                            17:52\r\n                            You must know that God is the One who hires and fires. God is the only One who decides how many dollars are in your pocket. You must know that. You think that your boss is the one who hired you or fired you, or may fire you, provides for you. Then, you're in the same trap. So, this is why we are here for.\r\n                            Size of the soul.\r\n                            18:17\r\n                            I wanna go to the verse, it says, \"once they see what...\" that's 24 [72:24] Once they see what is awaiting them, they will find out who is really weaker in power, and fewer in number.\r\n                            18:32\r\n                            Cause out of all of Tucson, half a million people, only about 50 people come here to this mosque to worship God alone.\r\n                            18:41\r\n                            So, in this city, we appear to be 50 among half a million people.\r\n                            18:48\r\n                            There may be 50 more out there worship God alone under the name of Christianity or Judaism\r\n                            18:56\r\n                            but they do believe that God alone has all the power. So, that's 100 out of half a million.\r\n                            19:02\r\n                            This appears to be a minority. You see, you're walking around with your body that is visible.\r\n                            19:10\r\n                            They say \"this is Catherine Robinson.\" But they don't see what she really looks like, what size she is.\r\n                            19:17\r\n                            We learn from Sura 17 that the differences in the Hereafter are far greater. The difference between Iman and Gatut is 40, but in the Hereafter the differences\r\n                            19:33\r\n                            are far more greater, Sura 17. So, your real size is as big as the city of Phoenix, for example. You're walking around, you see this size. Their size, the people who are not worshipping God alone, they actually shrink.\r\n                            19:51\r\n                            Their soul actually shrinks to the size of a cat. So, there are 100 people whose size is as big as the city of Phoenix, each one of them.\r\n                            20:01\r\n                            And half a million size ants. \"who is really weaker in power, and fewer in number.\"\r\n                            20:12\r\n                            One man and a million ants, which one is  really stronger? Where is the majority? Is it  \r\n                            20:18\r\n                            the one, one person or the million ants? When  you walk out the mosque, you can see one million ants sometimes.\r\n                            20:27\r\n                            Did you see them today? So, where is the majority? This is what this means because once they see what is awaiting them...\r\n                            20:43\r\n                            Because right now they cannot see. We do not see ourselves. We only see our bodies. Catherine.\r\n                            20:50\r\n                            (Unintelligible).\r\n                            21:16\r\n                            The messenger: They're after everything (unintelligible). You're walking around you're a hidden queen. You're walking around, people don't know what your size is, who you really are\r\n                            21:33\r\n                            which is a lot of fun because you don't need secret service or guards or anything. You can walk in the market and buy apples, and meat and eggs.\r\n                            21:45\r\n                            Yes, secret secret service. That's the best secret service. You do have secret service.\r\n                            21:53\r\n                            (unintelligible).\r\n                            22:20\r\n                            The messenger: Also, in terms of... cause if you think of believers and unbelievers, how many unbelievers there are and how many believers there are, we cannot count. And even in those terms, when you have a huge entity\r\n                            22:34\r\n                            and a small entity, the huge entity is the majority. The one person and one million ants, I mean, the one person is the majority.\r\n                            22:45\r\n                            (unintelligible).\r\n                            One Angel in charge of Hell.\r\n                            23:20\r\n                            The messenger: Except 19 is not the angels of Hell as they think. 19 is not the angels of Hell as they think.\r\n                            23:29\r\n                            Edip: Angels of Hell. There are angels of Hell.\r\n                            23:40\r\n                            The messenger: I don't know. It seems like there's only one angel in charge of Hell. His name is Mãlek.\r\n                            23:52\r\n                            The messenger: His name is mentioned in the Quran, Mãlek. Edip: (unintelligible)\r\n                            23:57\r\n                            The messenger: How would you get that? Now, don't speculate. Edip: There are some angels in Quran. The messenger: Where? Who? No, where?\r\n                            24:22\r\n                            The messenger: There is only one angel. As far as guarding Hell is concerned, only one angel and his name is Mãlek. Now, قَالُوا۟ is where?\r\n                            24:34\r\n                            أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ نَذِيرٌۭ (67:8) سَأَلَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَآ أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ نَذِيرٌۭ (67:8)\r\n                            24:42\r\n                            The messenger: Sura 67\r\n                            24:50\r\n                            The messenger: No, no, no. خَزَنَتُهَآ is plural.\r\n                            25:01\r\n                            The messenger: This is set of mysterious things, God hasn't revealed yet, exactly the details of how many...how, what is the system because\r\n                            25:14\r\n                            كُلَّمَآ أُلْقِىَ فِيهَا فَوْجٌۭ سَأَلَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَآ أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ نَذِيرٌۭ (67:8)\r\n                            25:20\r\n                            Now, are these angels outside Hell or inside? The one who's taking care of Hell is Mãlek or what? They will say “O Mãlek, let your Lord finish us off.”\r\n                            25:33\r\n                            He will say, “You are staying forever. [43:77]\r\n                            25:49\r\n                            The messenger: No, but see, here, it's not connected with Hell. At the end of the verse, it says \"nobody knows...\" you're right, but \"nobody knows what the number is.\" And that's not... this is a general statement. Also at the beginning it says\r\n                            26:08\r\n                            وَمَا جَعَلْنَآ أَصْحَـٰبَ ٱلنَّارِ إِلَّا مَلَـٰٓئِكَةًۭ ۙ (74:31) What is أَصْحَـٰبَ ٱلنَّارِ? مَلَـٰٓئِكَةًۭ, angels Who are أَصْحَـٰبَ ٱلنَّارِ? What does أَصْحَـٰبَ ٱلنَّارِ mean?\r\n                            26:18\r\n                            companions of Hell, the guards of Hell, the owners of Hell, friends of Hell. We do not know what expression it is, still mysterious, but there is timing for everything.\r\n                            26:31\r\n                            And obviously, God doesn't want us at this time to know exactly what the arrangement is in Hell.\r\n                            26:39\r\n                            Edip: (unintelligible).\r\n                            26:45\r\n                            The messenger: That's possible but that's not what the Quran says.\r\n                            26:56\r\n                            The messenger: No, but you see, you have to... we know now... see those numbers in the Quran, we know that every letter in the Quran is accurately placed.\r\n                            27:07\r\n                            Now, it does not say that the guards of Hell are 19. It gives a general statement.\r\n                            27:13\r\n                            Edip: (unintelligible).\r\n                            27:21\r\n                            The messenger: That's the number that is عَلَيْهَا The number that is on it. Edip: Yes, on, on, on...\r\n                            27:28\r\n                            The messenger: On what? Edip: on سَقَرَ (74:26) The messenger: Right. Edip: سَقَرَ is a punishment.\r\n                            27:33\r\n                            The messenger: Right. Edip: Yes. The messenger: Is it Hell? See, we don't know. It could be here. Edip: but the أَصْحَـٰبَ ٱلنَّارِ\r\n                            27:43\r\n                            The messenger: The next verse Edip: Next verse did explain if it could be Hell or not.\r\n                            27:48\r\n                            The messenger: No, it doesn’t. There's no depiction at all. The messenger: It gives us as a certain statement. It says \"we made أَصْحَـٰبَ ٱلنَّارِ, the companions of Hell, angels.\r\n                            28:07\r\n                            So, it's a general statement. It does not say \"19 angels.\" It does not say that. (74:30) عَلَيْهَا تِسْعَةَ عَشَرَ It says \"on it are 19.\" It doesn't say 19 what.\r\n                            28:16\r\n                            Edip: (unintelligible).\r\n                            28:36\r\n                            The messenger: Then, at the end it says \"nobody knows what this number is.\" Edip: Nobody knows the soldiers of God. The messenger: Yes.\r\n                            28:48\r\n                            Edip: (unintelligible).\r\n                            28:58\r\n                            The messenger: Well, maybe God wants you to believe that there are 19 guards of Hell, at this time. Obviously, it's not relevant to (unintelligible).\r\n                            29:07\r\n                            (unintelligible).\r\n                            29:20\r\n                            The messenger: This is a Hadith that says when you die, two angels will ask you \"who is your god? And who is your prophet? What did you do?\r\n                            29:30\r\n                            Then, they beat you (unintelligible).\r\n                            29:38\r\n                            The messenger: It's a Hadith.\r\n                            29:44\r\n                            The messenger: And they have all kinds of stories. Are there any questions? We read a lot.\r\n                            30:09\r\n                            The messenger: Yes. New translation has counted the numbers of all (unintelligible). Everything is based on mathematics.\r\n                            30:39\r\n                            The messenger: Both are correct. It was more general in the last translation, but in new translation, it's more specific. Because in this Sura 27... 72, God gave us a lot more proof that this Sura specifically must be for our age.\r\n                            We are the early generations – Quranic proof will dominate the world ensuring later generations get the pure message.\r\n                            31:07\r\n                            Edip: Last translation is accurate, also. (Unintelligible).\r\n                            31:36\r\n                            The messenger: But both are correct. Both translations are correct. The messenger: Speaking of numbers, I just wanna pass on a thought to you that we think that we are on the advanced\r\n                            31:48\r\n                            Earth and everything now. The world is so technical, technologically advanced, but up until now only\r\n                            31:58\r\n                            less than 7% of people have come to this Earth from Adam until now. From now to the end of the world, still more than 93% of the people [will come]. So, we are... the earth is still an infant. And we are among the early generations.\r\n                            32:18\r\n                            To the people 200 years from now, we're gonna be the cave age, cave people. So, just think about it. The message, we're very early in human history. The message is being consolidated and it's being... will be delivered to the vast majority of the people.\r\n                            32:37\r\n                            All this past and the nonsense that happened in Christianity, the trinity and Jesus, son of God, and all this nonsense and the things that happened in Judaism, Rabbi Kushner and what he said\r\n                            32:48\r\n                            The nonsense that's happening in Islam, all these things are happening within a very brief period in time, relatively and involves a very small number of people.\r\n                            33:03\r\n                            But the new generations are enlightened. They are rebellious. They don't listen to their parents. They are free to think. And they will get the message supported by physical evidence, as you'll see.\r\n                            33:15\r\n                            And Satan will be really defeated. Satan is destined to be defeated. So, this message with the physical proof that you see on the wall over there.\r\n                            33:26\r\n                            On the wall, you see every single verse in the Quran, physical evidence. And this will be presented to more than 93% of the people in the world. Think about that! It's a lot of people who say, you know, they think \"all this nonsense involved a lot of people.\"\r\n                            End of the world.\r\n                            34:05\r\n                            The messenger: I'm sorry I missed that.\r\n                            34:20\r\n                            The messenger: Perhaps, God made a point in the Gospel that when Jesus was asked \"when is the end of the world?\" He said \"I don't know.\" And I call this (unintelligible). And when Muhammad was asked, it's also in the Quran, \"when is the end of the world?\" He said \"I don't know.\"\r\n                            34:34\r\n                            But God wanted us to know in this generation. So, I will have an appendix, appendix, what, \"end of the world.\"\r\n                            34:44\r\n                            appendix? One of the appendices. It's entitled \"end of the world.\" It gives you evidence as when the world will end. We know that the world will end 2280.\r\n                            34:57\r\n                            And the mathematical code. This is one of the things that God gave us (unintelligible).\r\n                            35:20\r\n                            The messenger: [72:25] Say, \"I do not know if what is promised to you will happen soon, or if my Lord will delay it for awhile.\" This is to tell the disbelievers that they're gonna be punished. I don't know when.\r\n                            35:31\r\n                            It's for the disbelievers.\r\n                            35:37\r\n                            No, no, no, it's for here.\r\n                            35:44\r\n                            The messenger: Nothing in this Sura is for Muhammad.\r\n                            35:54\r\n                            The messenger: You should know that. Edip: إِنْ أَدْرِىٓ أَقَرِيبٌۭ مَّا تُوعَدُونَ أَمْ يَجْعَلُ لَهُۥ رَبِّىٓ أَمَدًا (72:25) The messenger: Yes.\r\n                            36:10\r\n                            The messenger: It has nothing to do with the end of the world. This has to do with here. It has to do with this world. It is...\r\n                            36:18\r\n                            The messenger: There is nothing in this Sura that applies to Muhammad. If you look at the footnote here. You add the gematrical value of Rashad plus the gematrical value of Khalifa plus Sura number plus the verses 28, then you have a multiple of 19.\r\n                            36:36\r\n                            And also this Sura has the maximum number of Rashada, 4. And this is not my personal decision. (Unintelligible).\r\n                            36:50\r\n                            Edip: (unintelligible).\r\n                            36:58\r\n                            The messenger: Why do you say this is Muhammad? You're the one who discovered it. إِلَّا مَنِ ٱرْتَضَىٰ مِن رَّسُولٍۢ (72:27) Edip: Yes. I know.\r\n                            37:07\r\n                            See, [72:27] Only to a messenger that He chooses. In Arabic, it's إِلَّا مَنِ ٱرْتَضَىٰ مِن رَّسُولٍۢ (72:27) If you calculate the gematrical value of this phrase, it's 1919. And Edip Yuksel is the one who discovered that. And there's a whole bunch of mathematical proof that is...\r\n                            37:27\r\n                            I'm afraid to be embarrassed because... I'm afraid to be embarrassed until you are experiencing it. So, I can't afford to be embarrassed or ashamed or shy or modest. It's not modesty if you're a civil engineer to say \"I'm a civil engineer.\"\r\n                            37:41\r\n                            It is not arrogance when you're stating the truth.\r\n                            37:46\r\n                            In this whole Sura, nothing in it has anything to do with prophet Muhammad. There may be other places but not this Sura.\r\n                            37:56\r\n                            The mathematical evidence is overwhelming. We will see it in the appendices, footnotes in new translation. And when I tell you this, either I'm a very very bad person or I'm really a messenger of God.\r\n                            38:12\r\n                            Because nobody will fabricate lies against God, attribute it to God in this flagrant manner unless he's really really a disbeliever who doesn’t think he will face God one day on the Day of Judgement.\r\n                            38:25\r\n                            So, take your pick. There are only two extremes here, either a very bad person who claims to be receiving information from God or a true messenger of God. You can judge by our circumstances.\r\n                            38:48\r\n                            God gave us the mind to distinguish. Are there any questions on this that are not so embarrassing?\r\n                            38:59\r\n                            The messenger: Go ahead.\r\n                            39:26\r\n                            The messenger: Well, that person really does not know anything. It's a pre-requisite that the person knows what the mathematical proof is.\r\n                            39:35\r\n                            The messenger: A person who doesn’t know the code will not understand anything, will be like a person who's born 100 years ago. Mathematical code is a requirement for understanding a lot of things.\r\n                            39:50\r\n                            The messenger: No, it doesn’t intend \"Muhammad.\" Lots of codes, they are not for Muhammad. Lots of codes are for you.\r\n                            39:57\r\n                            (112:1) قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ It's not for Muhammad. It's for you. (114:1) قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ ٱلنَّاسِ It's not for Muhammad. It's for you.\r\n                            40:04\r\n                            In fact the vast majority of codes is not for Muhammad. A lot of codes in the Quran are for the Quran itself. Proclaim\r\n                            40:14\r\n                            (3:31) قُلْ إِن كُنتُمْ تُحِبُّونَ ٱللَّهَ فَٱتَّبِعُونِى يُحْبِبْكُمُ ٱللَّهُ [3:31] [Say]: \"If you love GOD, you should follow me.\" GOD will then love you,\r\n                            40:20\r\n                            This is the Quran. According to the Quran, then God will love you. If you love God, you follow the word of God, not the words of men.\r\n                            40:29\r\n                            So, I don’t know where that expression's call is for Muhammad\r\n                            40:40\r\n                            Because it's not. It's very clear if you saw it. QOL means \"say.\" QOL means \"say.\" The majority of QOLs in the Quran are not for prophet Muhammad.\r\n                            40:53\r\n                            There are also many things in the Quran that are in the future not for the prophet Muhammad. Some of them are clearly stated in future tense.\r\n                            41:07\r\n                            So, Quran is valid for all times. OK. Shall we move on to Sura 73? Please, Catherine.\r\n                            41:19\r\n                            Catherine: Sura 73: Cloaked In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\r\n                            41:26\r\n                            [73:1] O you cloaked one. [73:2] Meditate during the night, except rarely. [73:3] Half of it, or a little less. [73:4] Or a little more. And read the Quran from cover to cover. [73:5] We will give you a heavy message.\r\n                            41:37\r\n                            [73:6] The meditation at night is more effective, and more righteous. [73:7] You have a lot of time during the day for other matters. [73:8] You shall commemorate the name of your Lord, to come ever closer and closer to Him. [73:9] Lord of the east and the west; there is no other god besides Him. You should choose Him as your advocate.\r\n                            41:55\r\n                            [73:10] And remain steadfast in the face of their utterances, and disregard them in a nice manner. [73:11] And let Me deal with the rejectors, who have been generously blessed; just give them a little time. [73:12] We have severe punishments, and Hell. [73:13] Food that can hardly be swallowed, and painful retribution.\r\n                            42:14\r\n                            [73:14] The day will come when the earth and the mountains will quake, and the mountains will turn into a weightless pile. [73:15] We have sent to you a messenger, just as we sent to Pharaoh a messenger. [73:16] Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger and, consequently, we punished him severely. [73:17] If you disbelieve, how can you evade a day so terrible that it makes the infants gray-haired?\r\n                            42:33\r\n                            [73:18] The heaven will shatter therefrom. His promise is true. [73:19] This is a reminder; whoever wills, let him choose the path to his Lord.\r\n                            42:43\r\n                            [73:20] Your Lord knows that you meditate during two-thirds of the night, or half of it, or one-third of it, and so do some of those who believed with you. GOD has designed the night and the day, and He knows that you cannot always do this. He has pardoned you. Instead, you shall read what you can of the Quran. He knows that some of you may be ill, others may be traveling in pursuit of GOD's provisions, and others may be striving in the cause of GOD.\r\n                            43:07\r\n                            You shall read what you can of it, and observe the contact prayers (Salat), give the obligatory charity (Zakat), and lend GOD a loan of righteousness. Whatever good you send ahead on behalf of your souls, you will find it at GOD far better and generously rewarded. And implore GOD for forgiveness. GOD is Forgiver, Most Merciful.\r\n                            43:29\r\n                            The name of this Sura is Cloaked. A cloak or cover can be a protection for us against weather\r\n                            43:38\r\n                            inclement weather, for instance. Or it can be  a barrier or a veil, something that blinds us or deafens us.\r\n                            43:51\r\n                            And keeping that in mind, looking at verses 1 through 7,  the night was designed for our rest.  \r\n                            44:00\r\n                            There are no distractions during the night for us, certainly not like there are during the day when the world seems to wake up and pick up speed and get itself up to 300 miles an hour before the sunset.\r\n                            44:13\r\n                            This is a special time with Allah for us. It is a time when we, our own bodies and our own minds are winding down and there is space and peace about our...\r\n                            44:24\r\n                            The messenger: (unintelligible) Excuse me.\r\n                            44:40\r\n                            Catherine: And God is telling us that here any time that we spend reading the Quran, meditating is for our own good here.\r\n                            44:51\r\n                            God doesn't need for us to do this. God is in no need at all. And He's giving us an opportunity, guiding us to take advantage of an opportunity during our busy days in our lives\r\n                            45:06\r\n                            to spend time with Him. In verse 8, the reason for the guide, the hint of provision of day\r\n                            45:15\r\n                            we're working, night, we rest, for example, is God's consciousness, at 24 hours a day, is our goal, commemorating the name of our God 24 hours a day, every minute\r\n                            45:30\r\n                            so that every cell in our body, every thought in our mind is preceded by Allah. Alhamdu Lillah. Subhan Allah. Every chance we  get out loud, no matter where we are.\r\n                            45:43\r\n                            What I have found to be amazing about that is when that became a habit of mine and I'm not quite sure when that was, sometimes someone will ask me what I'm saying.\r\n                            45:55\r\n                            Well, I can tell you how weird that is. Very few people ask me what it is I'm saying. Very few people are interested. I write Bism Allah on my checks, all of them.\r\n                            46:10\r\n                            Well, a lot of the things that I have to remember God for 24 hours a day, no matter what we do, no matter when we do it.\r\n                            46:19\r\n                            Verse 9, you should choose Him as your advocate. There is no other god beside Him. No one and no thing does anything. And if we don't know that then we do not know God. If we do not know that God is doing everything and therefore logically and rationally\r\n                            46:38\r\n                            the only One to call upon any help, for any provision, for any understanding, for any guidance, for any relief is God alone, we've gone astray somewhere.\r\n                            46:49\r\n                            And we may never get back if we don't strive to understand that God does everything. Not to be confused with, again, putting your finger in the fire. And I've heard that when I went back to, 2 years ago, 1987, I happened to be away and I asked Rashad \"please take probably a Khutba\" at that time and he had to give it.\r\n                            47:13\r\n                            It is a marvelous Khutba when it is there that I first heard Rashad talk about putting your finger in the fire and how the fire was created for us to be in our service. We would use it to cook, I think the phrase was \"a delicious raw steak to a fine meal or we could put our finger in it and burn ourselves.\"\r\n                            47:32\r\n                            God created them all, the fire, the food and our nerve system. But it was our free will that we determined how we used it and what path, if we could use that as a metaphor, we would choose to be on.\r\n                            47:47\r\n                            We have to know that God is doing everything. We have to know that if we need anything, asking anyone for anything, whatever comes to us from anyone, bad, good or indifferent comes from God and it's for our own good.\r\n                            48:03\r\n                            They're reminders, they're tests, they're provisions, whatever it is, a comment you don't wanna hear, a criticism you don't wanna hear, it's from God. God is correcting you, asking you to think, maybe not to correct yourself based on the criticism, but to rethink what it is you're doing to remind you that God is doing everything.\r\n                            48:27\r\n                            Verse 10 [73:10] remain steadfast in the face of their utterances, and disregard them in a nice manner.\r\n                            48:33\r\n                            God is saying if we know that God is doing everything, we're not to falter and that believe, no matter what we hear. We're also not to judge others. We have no way of knowing who's gonna make it and who's not.\r\n                            48:45\r\n                            We don't know that something we say is going to be the turning point for something else down the road. And we need to be consistently steadfast with our beliefs.\r\n                            48:58\r\n                            We were consistently admonished as how to treat other people. We are not to judge them. We are not to treat them nastily.\r\n                            49:06\r\n                            We are not to force them. We are not to be angry and again I go back 2 years ago to that Khutba which was amazing because Rashad say that\r\n                            49:15\r\n                            \"and I'm talking to you\" and he did with every one of us sitting here, including himself. And said if we get angry at anybody for anything, we're challenging God, we're objecting to God.\r\n                            49:26\r\n                            It's so simple now. I can tell how often I (unintelligible) that. Riding down the road the other day with my son, someone caught him, you know how people drive in Tucson, someone just cut in front of him within inches and he yelled at them\r\n                            49:47\r\n                            in our car. He yelled at them \"stupid.\" He was very angry, prepping the wheel trying to maintain control. And I said \"God did that. You shouldn't be yelling at that person.\" Well, that person was stupid and he... we've been working on this for two days, that is.\r\n                            Dealing with anger, objection and provocation.\r\n                            50:05\r\n                            He said...now we got him coming around to say \"well, I wasn’t really objecting to God. I was just blowing off steam (unintelligible).\" (unintelligible) when you get angry.\r\n                            50:16\r\n                            And this is true about the people that have been rejecting what we have to say or reject how we choose to live our lives based on what God has told us.\r\n                            50:25\r\n                            We're not to aggress against them with our minds, with suspicion, with words, with behavior.\r\n                            50:34\r\n                            We're to remain steadfast because of our own beliefs. Do you have a pledge to hear? Yeah?\r\n                            51:00\r\n                            The messenger: Why did they hate you on it?\r\n                            51:15\r\n                            The messenger: You have to go ahead of that and find out why... what provoked this person. You have to find out what you did to provoke that person.\r\n                            51:29\r\n                            The messenger: But you're starting the middle of the story. Somebody came punched me in the face, right? This is the middle of the story. Go to the end of it.\r\n                            51:43\r\n                            The messenger: What you see, the fist fight is always for something. What is it?\r\n                            51:54\r\n                            The messenger: You're not supposed to get in a fist fight to start with.\r\n                            52:07\r\n                            The messenger: Somebody punched me in the face. I will not get angry at that person. I will get angry at myself for provoking him.\r\n                            52:17\r\n                            The messenger: I will not... I would ask \"how did this happen?\" and find out what did I do to make him so angry.\r\n                            52:25\r\n                            You know, it's a sin in Islam if you annoy anybody, if you hurt anybody. You committed a sin.\r\n                            52:33\r\n                            So, obviously you made that person so... you've hurt him somehow that he came and punched you in the face. You committed a sin and you paid for it. So, it should be objective... it should not be objective to (unintelligible).\r\n                            52:48\r\n                            Yes. (Unintelligible).\r\n                            52:59\r\n                            Say, how would he aggravate you and annoy you? He said \"I don't like you because you're Iranian,\" for example. Did somebody say \"I don't like you because you're a Khomeini man?\"\r\n                            53:14\r\n                            If somebody says \"I don't like you because you're a Khomeini man.\" Then, you know he's a stupid person. Because he's passing judgement on you. It would be like you're walking on the street and a dog barks at you. What would you do?\r\n                            53:26\r\n                            You just look (unintelligible) at that person. You don't get into a fight.\r\n                            53:40\r\n                            Catherine: But you also mentioned aggression against your family and protection of yourself and your family. That's a different issue. You have the right and God tells us we do to protect ourselves. We do not have the right to aggress first. You have the right to protect yourselves.\r\n                            53:58\r\n                            The messenger: In Sura 42, it says \"you stand up for your rights.\"\r\n                            54:16\r\n                            The messenger: No, it's better not to get to that stage where he swings at you. I would ignore that. It actually takes more strength.\r\n                            54:25\r\n                            It takes more strength not to (unintelligible). I'm thinking solely because Sammy got in a situation like this and if I were in Sammy's place, I would be flunking the test. I would have punched the guy. He was stronger. He did the right thing. I could not oppose it.\r\n                            54:50\r\n                            (Unintelligible).\r\n                            55:17\r\n                            The messenger: You should not get into any fist fights. Just ignore it. It takes more strength to restrain yourself than to get provoked into a fist fight or... You'll be a bigger man if you walk away.\r\n                            55:35\r\n                            Yes. Quran says you have the right to stand up for your right. He punched you in the face, you can punch him back. It's your right, but God tells you it's better to be stronger if you can restrain yourself.\r\n                            55:52\r\n                            Yes, of course. Self defense is always justified.\r\n                            56:08\r\n                            A man: Sometimes my parents told me that fighting is wrong.\r\n                            56:59\r\n                            The messenger: Yeah, (unintelligible) takes more strength than joining a fight. Hamid.\r\n                            57:28\r\n                            The messenger: I wanna tell you. If you are with God, nothing will happen to you. You're gonna be a winner. When you are a person of God, you'll be a winner all the time. Don't worry.\r\n                            58:15\r\n                            The messenger: I think, maybe Catherine should have used the word sadness, disappointed, not angry. You don't become sad and depressed. That's objection. Happiness is devotion to God. Happiness is submission to God.\r\n                            58:36\r\n                            The opposite of that path is objection. If you're sad, you're objecting. So, maybe anger is not the correct word.\r\n                            58:54\r\n                            Yes, exactly. ٱلْكَـٰظِمِينَ ٱلْغَيْظَ (3:134) Suppressors of anger.\r\n                            Quranic night starts at sunset – All prayers especially dawn important.\r\n                            59:01\r\n                            One of the characteristics of a believer is the suppressor of anger. It's just you understand life. When you read the Quran, you read God's message and understand what life is all about. You know that it is not worth it to get in a fist fight, be angry because of what somebody said.\r\n                            59:18\r\n                            Especially if it is something stupid.\r\n                            59:26\r\n                            You definitely have to defend yourself. If you can avoid, you can forgive and forget, you'll be much stronger. Back to Catherine and finish this Sura.\r\n                            59:37\r\n                            The messenger: Can I make a comment also on the first few verses? Excuse me, I take it back. Two more minutes. I want you to understand what the night is. The Quranic night begins at sunset.\r\n                            59:47\r\n                            So, when it says [73:2] Meditate during the night, except rarely. [73:3] Half of it, or a little less.\r\n                            59:52\r\n                            You're commemorating God when you pray the Sunset, when you pray the Night, when you mention the name of God before you sleep, when you get up for Dawn prayer,\r\n                            1:00:03\r\n                            you already covered half the night like that. Because the night begins at 7 o'clock. It's sunset right now.\r\n                            1:00:11\r\n                            We pray the Night at 9 o'clock. We get up at 4 o'clock or 5 o'clock for the Dawn prayer, 5 o'clock.\r\n                            1:00:18\r\n                            So, 9 to 5, you already covered a good portion of the night. Quranic night, the Torah night, in the old scriptures, night begins at sunset.\r\n                            1:00:29\r\n                            And the day begins at sunrise. So, it's roughly 12 hours for the night.\r\n                            1:00:37\r\n                            What this is telling you is you must never, must never miss the Dawn prayer, the Fajr prayer.\r\n                            1:00:47\r\n                            I'm always surprised when I visit many places and find that half the people or more than half don't do the Dawn prayer. You're not being fair to yourself.\r\n                            1:00:57\r\n                            See, we were swept in the crowd when we were in the Heavenly Society. You don't wanna be swept in the crowd again, here. You don't wanna repeat the same mistake.\r\n                            1:01:06\r\n                            The people are so obvious to God that when we do a little bit, we think we're doing a lot.\r\n                            1:01:12\r\n                            Because compared to them, you do one prayer a day, you're doing a lot. But don't be swept in the crowd and don't measure what you're doing by what is happening in the world.\r\n                            1:01:27\r\n                            Cause the world is just totally oblivious to God. And this makes you think that you stepped up, you're doing a lot. That would be on my Khutba next. But don't be swept in the crowd, IN SHAA ALLAH.\r\n                            1:01:43\r\n                            The messenger: Yes.\r\n                            1:01:54\r\n                            The messenger: Idol worship.\r\n                            1:02:01\r\n                            The messenger: Yes, Anything is forgivable. Murder is forgivable. Stealing, lying, cheating, all these things are forgivable, but idol worship is not if the person dies an idol worshipper.\r\n                            1:02:15\r\n                            Yes, you can clean your record any minute by repenting. Repentance cleans your slate as if you are a newborn baby.\r\n                            1:02:25\r\n                            The messenger: Yes.\r\n                            1:02:33\r\n                            The messenger: No, it's you (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:02:40\r\n                            The messenger: Yeah, again that's a famous (unintelligible) but it is really... oh you most (unintelligible) meditate during the night except rarely.\r\n                            1:02:53\r\n                            When you're covered up with your blanket, you're cloaked.\r\n                            Read Quran during the night and Dawn.\r\n                            1:03:16\r\n                            The messenger: Yes.\r\n                            1:03:26\r\n                            The messenger: The Fajr prayer. We've come a long way towards that but I would recommend reading the Quran every night and every Fajr.\r\n                            1:03:39\r\n                            No, no, but you're covering, you're covering that period. See, the  prayer is not just the time that you're doing the prayer.\r\n                            1:03:44\r\n                            The times of anticipation is also commemoration of God. You look at the clock and you say \"I'm gonna pray the Night in 10 minutes, IN SHAA ALLAH.\"\r\n                            1:03:56\r\n                            The messenger: Right. Right. Absolutely, yes. Yes.\r\n                            1:04:04\r\n                            This is why the 5 prayers are so important. Cause it's not just the few minutes, it's not just the few minutes that you're doing them.\r\n                            1:04:14\r\n                            The messenger: OK. Back to verse 20. Catherine: Verse 20? The messenger: Excuse me, wherever you are.\r\n                            1:04:21\r\n                            Catherine: Verse 11, [73:11] let Me deal with the rejectors, who have been generously blessed; just give them a little time. [73:12] We have severe punishments, and Hell. [73:13] Food that can hardly be swallowed.\r\n                            1:04:31\r\n                            Give them enough rope, you know, hang themselves is what comes to mind. They will either pass or be rejectors, will either pass or fail the test that God gives them,\r\n                            1:04:42\r\n                            knowing that God gave them as many chances in the past as He gives every other person. God knows who will pass and who will not. He's the Perfect Designer. We need to worry for our own selves.\r\n                            1:04:54\r\n                            And this is related to the verse 10 and how to treat other people. Let God take care of those who reject the message.\r\n                            1:05:03\r\n                            Line 14, [73:14] The day will come when the earth and the mountains will quake, and the mountains will turn into a weightless pile.\r\n                            1:05:08\r\n                            There are other mentions on descriptions of the Day of Judgement when the Earth will change its appearance. The Earth and mountains are considered, perceived by our senses to be the most solid of all things.\r\n                            1:05:24\r\n                            And so this is a really good metaphor for one who thinks about, just the one sentence that God is telling us what's gonna happen. The inside of the Earth is molten lava. There's not solid at all about it.\r\n                            1:05:39\r\n                            Recently, I had an illness too which has made this solid Earth, the solid world that we touch, smell, feel each day of our lives, distorted that.\r\n                            1:05:53\r\n                            And, and erased the illusion of this world. And it would be a quite interesting experience that you feel you are floating. And that's all I can think of to describe it. And it can be frightening at the same time. I imagine at the same time what the astronauts are feeling in space.\r\n                            1:06:11\r\n                            That's when then there is some way to connect to something. I think...\r\n                            1:06:16\r\n                            The messenger: Your soul is growing. Catherine: I hope so. I desperately hope so. The messenger: You're like weightless. Catherine: In any case....not sure you'd notice.\r\n                            1:06:27\r\n                            Catherine: In any case, this is a really good metaphor for what will happen. Those... and for the (unintelligible) then this world is an illusion, this life is temporary play. And it's all set up just... God is so Merciful to give us another chance when we blew it the first time.\r\n                            1:06:45\r\n                            And we did blow it first time. There's no debating about it.\r\n                            1:06:51\r\n                            [73:15] We have sent to you a messenger, we sent Pharaoh a messenger. [73:16] He disobeyed. We punished him severely. [73:17] If you disbelieve, how do you expect to evade a day so terrible that it makes the infants gray-haired?\r\n                            1:07:03\r\n                            I don't know the name of the illness but there's a rare illness, and I think, Rabbi Kushner's son had this illness. I just don't  know the medical name for it where children age. Infants age and die of old age when they are still young children.\r\n                            1:07:19\r\n                            It's a very rare illness. I don't know if it existed when the Quran was revealed. However, this is also a good metaphor for how our lives are gonna be dear to us, how the Day of Resurrection as we live one hour, one minute.\r\n                            1:07:34\r\n                            The messenger: But this is a... this... in English you say \"scared and went white.\" I don't know why. Catherine: Absolutely.\r\n                            1:07:42\r\n                            Catherine: That happens The messenger: What's happens? Catherine: Progeria (Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS)).\r\n                            1:07:49\r\n                            The messenger: It's just a... I think it's just a proverb.\r\n                            1:07:57\r\n                            The messenger: The reality is that this happens, but it's also a metaphor for the brevity of our lives.\r\n                            1:08:07\r\n                            [73:18] The heaven will shatter therefrom. His promise is true. The guarantee is always there, built in. This is a reminder. Whoever wills, let him choose the path to his Lord. The human being has complete freedom. This is the human affliction and it's the human blessing and the hope of redemption.\r\n                            1:08:26\r\n                            If we choose Allah alone, God will be with us always. If we don't, and the tendency of the human being is not to, the tendency is to worship ourselves. That's the last bastion.\r\n                            1:08:41\r\n                            When we dealt with money, children, wealth, status, power, fame, we get back to ourselves. So, it's a constant balancing act. If you choose Allah alone, this narrowest path may save you from falling from it.\r\n                            1:08:54\r\n                            And again, I remember someone saying to me who he once \"shame on... shame on you,\" told me twice. Shame on me. This is my second time.\r\n                            1:09:05\r\n                            And it will be shame on me if I don't get it right this time.\r\n                            1:09:14\r\n                            Verse 20 [73:20] Your Lord knows that you meditate two-thirds of the night, or half of it.\r\n                            1:09:21\r\n                            He knows that you cannot always do this. And He has pardoned you. God made us. He knows what our limitations are. He knows we have to sleep some time. And that we can't stay up all of the night long reading Quran and meditating all nights through all of our lives.\r\n                            1:09:38\r\n                            So, Mercifully provides for us and says \"You shall read what you can.\" And allows for illness and allows for traveling and allows for the necessities of this life, constantly reminding us that we need to be cognizant of God 24 hours a day.\r\n                            1:09:53\r\n                            There's a verse here, part of the verse \"You shall read what you can of it and observe the contact prayer.\"\r\n                            1:10:00\r\n                            They way the contact prayer is spoken of in Quran is... it's spoken of as though everyone knows of it, as everyone does. When the time the Quran was revealed, Salat was a common practice. (Unintelligible) a common practice. And this is why we don't find a\r\n                            1:10:20\r\n                            description of Salat by detail in Quran. \"Give the obligatory charity (Zakat), and lend GOD a loan of righteousness. Whatever good you send ahead on behalf of your souls, you will find it at GOD far better and generously rewarded.\"\r\n                            1:10:38\r\n                            This is the PRA (Post Retirement Account) that Rashad talked about. And it's a wonderful reality based on simple way to understand what it is we do, Post Retirement Account. We get 10 for 1 here, folks, guaranteed.\r\n                            1:10:55\r\n                            10 for 1. You don't have to do much for that, a lot of righteous in it, God alone.\r\n                            1:11:03\r\n                            And our souls do grow and they do expand. We even have no idea how big they are.\r\n                            1:11:09\r\n                            When Rashad gives these numbers like 10-dollar parking tickets because you don't pay (unintelligible). That's, you know, that's not a joke. I would be whammed because it relates to all of us when we park (unintelligible), but it's the truth.\r\n                            1:11:28\r\n                            So, again, 24-hour God consciousness being the goal and righteousness and living according to the Quran's instructions, God willing, we won't have too many (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:11:43\r\n                            That's... and implore God for forgiveness. God is forgiver and Most Merciful. Everyday, I talk to Dave and say that God (unintelligible). We're so conditioned in that state.\r\n                            1:11:56\r\n                            There's no condition if you call upon Him when you're wearing a blue dress and it's 5 in the afternoon. There's no condition. God hears those who call upon Him alone. That's unconditional. (unintelligible). He's always there for us. All we have to do is (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:12:15\r\n                            I need to stop. Are there any comments or questions? The messenger: God bless you. Excellent job. Mã Shã Allãh.\r\n                            Fujr prayer Important – We could be pardoned if we miss it once in a while (once a month).\r\n                            1:13:14\r\n                            The messenger: My soul doesn’t eat.\r\n                            1:13:25\r\n                            The messenger: This has to do with missing the Fajr prayer once in a long while. God says \"you cannot do it all the time.\" Maybe, once a month you miss Fajr.\r\n                            1:13:34\r\n                            Really this is a minimum, the 5 prayers including the Dawn prayer. It's very important for you to do the Dawn prayer. You must set the alarm to get up.\r\n                            1:13:44\r\n                            Right now, you must do it before 5:15 in the morning. Many drop out because the days gets longer and longer. You don't wanna be a drop-out.\r\n                            1:13:57\r\n                            5:15, before 5:15.\r\n                            1:14:04\r\n                            This means you're tired. You're very tired and cannot... you didn’t get up for the Fajr prayer because you're tired. You're doing extra effort.\r\n                            1:14:16\r\n                            Yes, traveling or your time is mixed up.\r\n                            1:14:21\r\n                            You travel from New York, you leave there at 12 midnight and you come here and the Dawn is 2 o'clock New York time\r\n                            1:14:31\r\n                            So, this is two hours of sleep. Most, most probably, you will miss Fajr on that day.\r\n                            1:14:48\r\n                            No, no. It's saying \"business.\" You're doing your business. You may be tired because of business, because of something you have done. You were digging ditches all day until 3 o'clock in the morning.\r\n                            1:14:58\r\n                            Chances are you're gonna sleep through the Fajr in that night. Traveling in pursuit of God's provisions means business. You're doing business.\r\n                            1:15:09\r\n                            I think we have to stop. Our teacher, next week, will be Dr. Sabahi, so we can see what the Farsi translation is saying.\r\n                            1:15:17\r\n                            Nothing at... you can sit by your dad, Amir, and give him a few pieces of information. OK.\r\n                            1:15:31\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi will take Sura 74, 75, 76. So, keep your\r\n                            1:15:38\r\n                            new translation. Don't forget it! We have to read a lot of Al-Fãtehah for birthdays, today. Lydia, Annie, Douglas, who's the fourth one?\r\n                            1:15:57\r\n                            The messenger: Amir. See, I forgot Amir. How can I forget Amir? Amir is the most important person in this room. Why? You tell us why. How can I forget Amir? OK. Amir and Annie and Douglas and Lydia\r\n                            1:16:17\r\n                            we're gonna recite Al-Fãtehah to give them a great year, coming up, and a greater year every year\r\n                            1:16:22\r\n                            after that. It is a characteristic of  the believers that things only get better.\r\n                            1:16:29\r\n                            Things get better for the believers. Every day is better than the previous one. Also, when we recite Al-Fãtehah, Mahvash may be going to\r\n                            1:16:37\r\n                            Iran soon and we wish her success and God will give her a good trip, IN SHAA ALLAH. God never turns us down when we read Al-Fãtehah.\r\n                            1:16:48\r\n                            And Catherine mentioned illness that makes her hide. So, we want to read what God says إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ (1:5) We worship you alone and ask Him to make her healthy.\r\n                            Virginity and perfect happiness.\r\n                            1:17:04\r\n                            And each one of you, your dearest wish. I want you to ask God for it, also. God loves it when you pray to Him.\r\n                            1:17:12\r\n                            Before we read Al-Fãtehah, I want to remind you that I just finished the appendix entitled \"virginity.\" And it begins by saying \"the sons and daughters of the believers are taught persistently and for their own happiness that they must keep themselves for their spouses,\r\n                            1:17:31\r\n                            the people who would be married to them. So, I'm urging all the parents to take a copy of that. It's only one page. Take it and show it to your children. It may be an embarrassing subject to you but it is a very important subject.\r\n                            1:17:44\r\n                            And it is never too early, never too late to ask for that page and take it and leave it with your children. And now for all Al-Fãtehahs that were requested. We're gonna turn to God and recite Al-Fãtehah.\r\n                            1:17:59\r\n                            Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem (1:1) Al hamdu Lillahi Rabbil ‘Alameen (1:2) Arrahman Arraheem (1:3) Maliki Yawm Eddeen (1:4) Eyyaka Na’abudu Wa Eyyaka Nasta’aeen (1:5) Ehdina Al-Serata Al-Mustaqeem (1:6) Serata Al-Lazeena An’amta ‘Alayhim Ghayri Al-Maghdoobi ‘Alayhim Wa Laddaalleen (1:7)\r\n                            1:18:18\r\n                            Before we close, I'm gonna remind you of just a couple of verses in Sura 54 that says \"God is the One who makes you happy,\" controls your happiness or miserable. God doesn’t make you miserable. We make ourselves miserable.\r\n                            1:18:29\r\n                            But God controls our happiness and our misery. In Arabic,\r\n                            1:18:34\r\n                            وَأَنَّهُۥ هُوَ أَضْحَكَ وَأَبْكَىٰ (53:43) He makes you laugh or cry. وَأَنَّهُۥ هُوَ أَغْنَىٰ وَأَقْنَىٰ (53:48)\r\n                            1:18:40\r\n                            He's the One who controls your wealth. He's the One who makes you rich or poor.\r\n                            1:18:47\r\n                            So, you remember that. God is one who controls your happiness and joy. God is the one who controls your wealth. Which means that if we follow God's law, we're guaranteed perfect life, perfect happiness. Congratulations. God bless you.<p></p>\r\n                            \r\n                            \r\n                            \r\n                            <p>02 Quran Study From Azhar 2 Sura 95 & Sura 96 By M Sabahi Two Verses Of Sura 9 Dropped Out To Demons</p>\r\n                            \r\n                            \r\n                            أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ The messenger: We seek refuge in God from Satan. He's after us. We are his main targets.\r\n                            0:08\r\n                            He doesn't care about the people who are out there drinking and gambling. They are disobeying God. He doesn't care about them. He doesn't bother with them. He's after us. God tells us so in the Quran.\r\n                            0:21\r\n                            \"I will sit on their straight path, the right path.\" We seek refuge in God from him.\r\n                            0:28\r\n                            In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. Our teacher tonight is Dr. Sabahi and his assistants are Dan, Ali and Amir.\r\n                            0:37\r\n                            A woman: No way!\r\n                            0:44\r\n                            The messenger: And we start with Sura Dr. Sabahi: 97. No, sorry, sorry. 95. I was just checking.\r\n                            1:21\r\n                            أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.\r\n                            1:30\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: The Suras that we're covering tonight start with 95, Fig (Al-Teen).\r\n                            1:43\r\n                            It consists of 8 AYAs, overall. And one of the short Suras of the later, latest parts of the Quran.\r\n                            1:55\r\n                            When I was looking at this Sura and the previous Suras that we covered, I realized that there are quite a few Suras that God starts with\r\n                            2:12\r\n                            different things that He's swearing by them. And  I tried to see what are those and thus far,\r\n                            2:22\r\n                            we have covered up to Sura 93 which was \"The Forenoon,\" which is the one that God starts with [93:1] By the forenoon.\r\n                            2:33\r\n                            And then [92:1] By the night. And then, I went back and tried  to check, see what other Suras God has done  \r\n                            2:38\r\n                            this. At least the ones that I came up with,  there were 12 Suras that God starts with  \r\n                            2:46\r\n                            the swear to different things. And I tried to see whether there is any relationship or why, why is God doing this and what is He trying to tell us.\r\n                            3:01\r\n                            There were some of them that one starts with the Sun, the moon, with the bright star, sky, the earth, galaxies, all the things that\r\n                            3:10\r\n                            we see around us. We see the sky and... around us. And then, there are others that God uses to changes that we see during the\r\n                            3:23\r\n                            every 24 hours, by the Dawn, the Forenoon, the Day, the Night, the Afternoon and the Dusk. And then\r\n                            3:32\r\n                            we have Sura 100 that is the Runners (The Gallopers (Al-'Aadeyaat)) which is a subject by itself. And we have a Sura The Town (Al-Balad).\r\n                            3:39\r\n                            And we have in Sura 91, we have \"the soul.\" It's something that we don't see. The things that we had\r\n                            3:49\r\n                            up to this point, these are the things that we see and God  is swearing by them. But by \"the soul\" or \"even and odd\"\r\n                            3:58\r\n                            and \"Promised Day\" and \"witness, and witnessed.\" These are the things that I found, they could reveal the latest parts of the Sura,\r\n                            4:06\r\n                            Suras of the... since 80, I think it is Sura 81. And if you look at those Suras, the only Sura that God has given a plant's name and also starts with\r\n                            4:22\r\n                            starting by the fig and the olive, this is the only Sura that we have. So, there should be something significant, I guess, about these two plants that God is swearing to. And overall, what I understand from this is that God is telling\r\n                            4:45\r\n                            us to look around and look at what is going on  around us and try to see what are the changes  \r\n                            4:54\r\n                            and try to understand, try to use our intelligence,  try to see and try to understand what is going on  \r\n                            5:04\r\n                            and see the signs that are all over the place. So,  with that I go back to Sura 95.\r\n                            5:14\r\n                            In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. [95:1] By the fig and the olive. [95:2] By the Mount Sinai. [95:3] And this honored town (Mecca).\r\n                            5:23\r\n                            And this honored, sorry. [95:4] We created man in the best design. In the new copy that we have AYA 5 is (unintelligible).\r\n                            5:36\r\n                            So, [95:4] We created man in the best design. [95:5] Then, we reverted him into lowliest of the lowly.\r\n                            5:42\r\n                            [95:6] Except those who believe and lead a righteous life; they receive a reward that is well deserved.\r\n                            5:48\r\n                            [95:7] Why do you still reject the faith? [95:8] Is GOD not the Most Wise, of all the wise ones?\r\n                            5:56\r\n                            So, we go back to verse [95:1] By the fig and the olive. There's a footnote here that is saying that fig, olive, Sinai and Mecca, they symbolize the prophets, Adam, Jesus, Moses, Abraham and Muhammad\r\n                            6:15\r\n                            which since there's not more in the footnote, I guess Dr. Khalifa is the one who can explain. From the town, I know it relates to Muhammad, Ebrahim. And Mount Sinai, it relates to Moses, but fig and olive that relates to Adam and Jesus\r\n                            6:38\r\n                            And he can explain to us, what does it mean? The messenger: Well, basically, it is universal that the fig leave... the thing that is clear is it reminds us of Adam and Eve in Paradise. They covered themselves with leaves of Paradise. But, universally, this seems to be related to Adam and Eve, the fig.\r\n                            7:02\r\n                            The olive, now the olive and Jesus are related. And Mount Sinai and Moses, Mecca with Abraham and Muhammad.\r\n                            7:13\r\n                            So, this represents the volume of the same message that came to us through different messengers, Adam to Muhammad, and the fig to Mecca.\r\n                            7:25\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: OK. So, after the first three verses, God says [95:4] We created man in the best design.\r\n                            7:32\r\n                            What is the meaning of that is something that we can think   of. What is, what is the best design? What is this  best design that God does? Because man is different\r\n                            7:45\r\n                            from the rest of the creatures. The only difference is that he has the brain and he can think and he can make decision and God has\r\n                            7:56\r\n                            given us that design and then we have decided to make a  decision. We made a decision and then went along\r\n                            8:06\r\n                            and then God tells us that He created us in the best  design and then diverted us to the lowliest of the lowly.\r\n                            8:18\r\n                            And then this is, this is one step the best design, the  second step is the lowliest of the lowly.\r\n                            8:25\r\n                            So, we start on the high, we go down to lowest and then there's a chance for those who believe and lead a righteous life  \r\n                            8:35\r\n                            to receive the reward that we deserve. So, it is up on us. God has given us the chance to change ourselves from the lowest  \r\n                            8:46\r\n                            of the lowly to go, to do something that we can get out of that lowliest of lowly and then go to a place that is better than the lowliest of the lowly. Ask my senior assistant, Hamid\r\n                            9:02\r\n                            to talk about fig and... to talk about fig and olive, I guess, that is referred to tell us what is the significance of these plants that\r\n                            9:16\r\n                            some botany work, I guess. Hamid: (unintelligible) I have information that may not be as relevant but just information regarding the plants themselves.\r\n                            9:35\r\n                            One of the things that's most common is that figs and olives are very common in almost every part of the world.\r\n                            9:42\r\n                            Everybody's nourishing on them and they're both very good source of nutrition especially fig (unintelligible) and especially in parts of the world where I come from (unintelligible).\r\n                            10:05\r\n                            Figs are a very good source of iron. (unintelligible).\r\n                            10:44\r\n                            The messenger: They have figs here, they're the sweetest figs in the world. (unintelligible). And I read his thoughts...\r\n                            11:01\r\n                            Hamid: (unintelligible).\r\n                            11:15\r\n                            Hamid: (unintelligible) two times in the year. and olives every other year. They don't even bloom one year. (unintelligible).\r\n                            11:32\r\n                            (unintelligible).\r\n                            11:50\r\n                            The messenger: Does everybody know that the olive oil actually reduces the cholesterol? Unlike any other fats, all other fats increase the cholesterol. Olive oil actually reduces cholesterol.\r\n                            12:04\r\n                            A man: a lot of oil contains a lot of (unintelligible). All the other oil is not pure oil (unintelligible).\r\n                            12:34\r\n                            The messenger: And I have another thing here is... Dr. Sabahi's excellent explanation\r\n                            12:41\r\n                            that I think touched on spiritual design, this design. And I just want to mention the best visible design as well with the human being\r\n                            12:53\r\n                            which is (unintelligible) 24 ounce of (unintelligible) mustard right here. I will try\r\n                            13:01\r\n                            to pick it up with 4 fingers. See, God designed our thumbs. So, if my design was just 4 fingers, (unintelligible) picked up, right?\r\n                            13:11\r\n                            How will you pick it up without this? So, this is the physical design of God.\r\n                            13:22\r\n                            Yeah that's very awkward, isn't it? It's very difficult. We take it for granted that it goes like this. (unintelligible). Also, we took for granted that we walk on 1 leg. Did you know that?\r\n                            13:40\r\n                            At any given moment, we walk on one leg. Now, if you design something, you will not design it to walk on 1 leg, see. It's always on one leg. You don't realize that but there is some little fluid in your ears that keeps your balance\r\n                            13:56\r\n                            and if it's messed up, you can't walk. You don't think about it. We take it for granted\r\n                            14:04\r\n                            that you're always on one leg. When you're walking, you're always on one. And normally, if you think about it, will you design\r\n                            14:10\r\n                            something yourself, you won't design something to go on one leg. But this is the perfect design, God gave to the human beings.\r\n                            14:22\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: Dan.\r\n                            14:45\r\n                            Dan: Actually, when I look at this verse, I  think about... I've been in our souls  \r\n                            14:52\r\n                            before we came here and then He created the best  possible way to move, come back to this life.\r\n                            15:00\r\n                            He created us, as you said, figures and things like that. Our soul, I don't know if this is true will be basically is low. \r\n                            15:11\r\n                            It's lower than what it was before we came here. We started in the ground. It's up to us to make  \r\n                            15:18\r\n                            it grow in this life like in line six [95:6] Except those who believe and work righteous; they enjoy a well-deserved recompense.\r\n                            15:29\r\n                            So, we have this kid and his soul is so pure but he's starving.\r\n                            15:35\r\n                            It's up to us what we grow to make our, to feed our  soul by praying, by following the commandments and things like  \r\n                            15:42\r\n                            that. And these are growing and growing and if  you don't do that, people might...\r\n                            15:51\r\n                            How can I say it? People sometimes people may think that  they have a good life like some of people  \r\n                            15:58\r\n                            who think that because they're getting money, they have the best life some for example  \r\n                            16:04\r\n                            some movie stars. They will have money, cars, everything.  Their souls don't have anything. There, you don't know  \r\n                            16:11\r\n                            if that they have a really good life or  not. It's up to us to actually make it grow  \r\n                            16:17\r\n                            but everybody departs from, from the  bottom. So, nobody can say \"well, I had an advantage, no, no.\r\n                            16:24\r\n                            Everybody can agree now. And when a person actually believes in God, I mean,  \r\n                            16:36\r\n                            there's only One God. Some people might be  pushing to some other direction, but for some reason  \r\n                            16:45\r\n                            I only see everybody, you know, always  before they even turn to that path, I would  \r\n                            16:51\r\n                            see everybody stopping in that path where everybody meets. And that enables to see\r\n                            16:56\r\n                            the right path and the wrong path, he's walking to the  wrong one. I don't know, for some reason,\r\n                            17:02\r\n                            I just feel everybody, you know, kind of when equal, in equal point in this kind of when they're waiting\r\n                            17:07\r\n                            And then he finds the right path. So, I feel that I mean this is up to us to watch we're doing. So, everybody\r\n                            17:14\r\n                            I feel that everybody starts from, from a  point that God made it that way some (unintelligible).\r\n                            17:21\r\n                            and you know, that's why.\r\n                            17:33\r\n                            (unintelligible).\r\n                            17:43\r\n                            Audience: Other animals, they didn't have a brain, they had a brain but they didn't have a decision\r\n                            17:51\r\n                            (unintelligible).\r\n                            18:00\r\n                            A tree would grow as tall as it possibly can. And if you take a redwood. Redwoods grow as high as it possibly   can knowing that it doesn't realize, you know, the sky, how  the sky is \"Oh, is it unattainable? Is it unreachable?\"\r\n                            18:12\r\n                            It will grow as tall as it possibly can and  it seems to me that man is the only one who does  \r\n                            18:21\r\n                            not develop on to try to achieve (unintelligible).\r\n                            18:40\r\n                            Audience: I mean, I don't know much about irrigation of those kind of trees like something like water irrigation of vegetables\r\n                            18:48\r\n                            if you want everything, you have those (unintelligible).\r\n                            18:58\r\n                            (unintelligible) harvest in summer the loose leaves (unintelligible).\r\n                            19:07\r\n                            all winter (unintelligible).\r\n                            19:18\r\n                            A man: Most of trees do that. (unintelligible).\r\n                            19:33\r\n                            Some people (unintelligible).\r\n                            19:42\r\n                            (unintelligible). Because as far as my understanding the olives get harvested every year.\r\n                            20:04\r\n                            The messenger: They have got something called alternate bearing. Crops are very heavy one year, very light the next year. So, this actually happens in (unintelligible), but we don't notice it.\r\n                            20:14\r\n                            You keep harvesting from different trees. These individual trees will do that.\r\n                            20:21\r\n                            But one tree will be heavy. The next one would be light. And then, they alternate next year. So, he's getting into botanical particulars.\r\n                            20:32\r\n                            Audience: I don't know about (unintelligible). when I studied botanics (unintelligible). with genetic engineering (unintelligible).\r\n                            21:04\r\n                            Audience: I didn’t generalize it. (unintelligible). Audience: I understand. What I'm saying is these kind of trees, it's not like water-irrigated everyday (unintelligible). They almost grow wild.\r\n                            21:24\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: She asked a question. No, she asked a question. A woman: (unintelligible). souls\r\n                            21:36\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: From what I understand it's like chemists (unintelligible). There are 3 steps. You were first created\r\n                            21:48\r\n                            the best design which I go through my notes and I think there's another chapter that... chapter 87, God mentions that\r\n                            22:03\r\n                            [87:1] Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High. [87:2] He creates and shapes. [87:3] He designs and guides.\r\n                            22:08\r\n                            So, He says that He designed us the best design. So, there's something like the ancients. We were the best like the rest of the creation among the best. And then based on what Rashad has quite frequently discussed that we made the decision to\r\n                            22:30\r\n                            give it a try, see, go with Satan, give it a try and made that decision. So, we went to the second step which is the lowliest.\r\n                            22:40\r\n                            We came down, left at eye level of life and then when we came down to see what it's like here.\r\n                            22:49\r\n                            And then see whether we can fight with Satan and succeed and go back to, try to reach the high level again. And I think the third step\r\n                            22:59\r\n                            is when you try to change, to get away from Satan, to lead to the right path and succeed in getting back to the High life, to get to the Heaven. This is the way I see it.\r\n                            23:14\r\n                            Audience: 2 questions. In Sura 4, (unintelligible).\r\n                            23:33\r\n                            Audience: Secondly, what is the meaning of \"we\" in verses 4 and 5? God says [95:4] We created man in the best design. And says [95:5] Then, we reverted him.\r\n                            23:43\r\n                            Does it really imply participation of angels, other forces in creation of man in the best design, Satan's involvement that is born to the lowest (unintelligible)?\r\n                            23:58\r\n                            The messenger: Dr. Sabahi just explained it, but also reverting lowliest of lowly applies also to this life as far as the disbelievers are concerned.\r\n                            The Quran is not the physical book.\r\n                            24:08\r\n                            We read in Sura 6, God says that they are worse than animals. The disbelievers and idol worshippers are worse than animals because they made a stupid decision not to be with God.\r\n                            24:26\r\n                            (unintelligible).\r\n                            24:45\r\n                            The messenger: No. This is actually, I'm glad you brought this  up. There's a lesson from God to teach us that the Quran   is not the ink and the paper. It's not the physical  book. We have a verse number five in Arabic, dropped out.  \r\n                            24:58\r\n                            Sura number two and verse number five names in this Sura, dropped out.. So, we have 2 verses\r\n                            25:05\r\n                            dropped out by mistake, one Arabic number 5, one English number 5 and the 2 false verses removed.\r\n                            25:13\r\n                            We have mathematical proof that verse 5 in Arabic, and verse 5 in English and other ones dropped out\r\n                            25:21\r\n                            belong in the Quran. But they have no evidence that the two false verses belong in the Quran. Are you following me?\r\n                            25:32\r\n                            There's evidence on the wall there, all this long number, 12692 numbers\r\n                            25:42\r\n                            they glued every verse in the Quran but not the two false verses. And that number is divisible by 19. If you include the two false verses, the whole thing collapses. We don't have anything.\r\n                            25:52\r\n                            As it is, we have a fantastic miracle now. So, God is telling us that you remember that you are living in an age of books, see?\r\n                            26:01\r\n                            This is probably a very primitive thing that a hundred years from now, they will laugh at us. They'd show movies where people looked in a book like this. Cause a hundred years from now, there'll be probably no books.\r\n                            26:12\r\n                            So, this is not the Quran. It's not the ink and the paper. When the prophet Muhammad went to the highest heaven to\r\n                            26:18\r\n                            receive the Quran, God didn't give him a book. \"Here's a book, Quran.\" Quran is in the heart.\r\n                            26:25\r\n                            And obviously God is making the point that because they say that falsehood cannot enter this book, so how come the Quran has the two verses entered in it?\r\n                            26:37\r\n                            They forget that the Quran is written in many different ways\r\n                            26:43\r\n                            And a lot of people printed it with the Suras mixed up, rearranged the verses.\r\n                            26:50\r\n                            They added things and dropped things, but this doesn't mean that God did not preserve the Quran because the Quran is not this physical book.\r\n                            26:57\r\n                            And we're having this demonstration with new translation. So, we will fix it. We will add the verses. After we receive the book,\r\n                            27:05\r\n                            we will add these two verses that dropped out by mistake. Also, we write the Quran in the computer electronically, so\r\n                            27:13\r\n                            what is, what is that? So, the Quran is in the heart. We know exactly what... we know exactly every letter that belongs in the Quran and anything\r\n                            27:26\r\n                            strange is added to it, we know that, too. If anything drops out, we know that. This is obviously God's will to teach us this lesson. The ink and the paper is not the Quran. Back to Dr. Sabahi.\r\n                            27:44\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: OK. One word before I go to Sura 96\r\n                            27:53\r\n                            The plants are overall one of the most amazing chemical factories  that exist on the earth. For a while I was, before coming to US, I was involved with research on plants and\r\n                            28:10\r\n                            drugs that are derived from plants. And as a chemist, I  was amazed to see how complex \r\n                            28:23\r\n                            these molecules are that you can take from a plant. As an example, I can tell you now is that the most effective cancer research\r\n                            28:35\r\n                            and the most effective compounds or agents against cancer thus far are the ones who have origins from plant materials. And China is one of the\r\n                            28:48\r\n                            leading countries in that respect. They invest a lot in national fund and research. And recently, there was a symposium. So, what happens is that the plants as time goes\r\n                            29:01\r\n                            by, they synthesize these things and you don't need too much  chemistry to understand that the only  \r\n                            29:07\r\n                            chemicals that are available to the plants are carbon dioxide, hydrogen from the ground and water. So, you have carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen, these 4\r\n                            29:19\r\n                            basically nature elements and some possible other things that come from the ground. And this plant as you seed it and it grows,\r\n                            29:28\r\n                            starts to put these things together. And then after a while, you take it to chemist, leaves goes to lab\r\n                            29:36\r\n                            and tries to extract these chemicals out of it  and then spends a lot of time, years maybe,\r\n                            29:42\r\n                            to see what is the structure. It started being one nitrogen, one oxygen, one hydrogen, billions of this in small pieces and then this plant has put these\r\n                            29:51\r\n                            together to gigantic molecules, all that patched together. First of all, human beings have a lot of trouble to identify\r\n                            29:59\r\n                            what the structure is because the definite structure of the plant is something that you need to know as a\r\n                            30:07\r\n                            chemist or as a pharmacist. So, after they find the structure of, they know the potency, they\r\n                            30:15\r\n                            try and say \"OK. This is effective against this infection or cancer or whatever.\" Then, they wanna make you buy it so that they can introduce it to the market and give it to people. So, should they go and kill all the plants?\r\n                            30:28\r\n                            No, the chemists come into play. So, OK, they're  gonna synthesize it, do this thing that the  plant does slowly. It's designed to do it. And so they do it in the lab and start. One of the the third grade synthetic  \r\n                            30:42\r\n                            chemists that was here a few month ago. He said \"they have been working for 5 years. I mean, they have been, a group of top-notch scientists, working to synthesize the molecule that would be, as we've shown, has been tried out. And\r\n                            30:58\r\n                            as we've shown in the past that it has the potency against cancer. So, it took them at least five years and they had one step to do and that is the difference was the molecule that they were  \r\n                            31:10\r\n                            synthesizing, was like the right glove of your hand that you can't put on your left hand. There's a difference. There's no way you can put on both your right and left hand,\r\n                            31:23\r\n                            or better understand, you cannot put a right glove on your left hand. Have you ever realized this?\r\n                            31:29\r\n                            That is a concept chemists call it Plurality. And that's one of the most amazing things that, in creation. And this is the only molecule, one molecule which is the right-handed molecule. It's really effective. The left-handedness is not effective at all.\r\n                            31:45\r\n                            The only difference is that if you look these are the mirror. If mirror is here, this is kind of exactly this hand's mirror image of... these molecules are mirror images of itself. But\r\n                            31:57\r\n                            one of them is as the cocaine as that property. If you take the same, exactly the same number of carbon, nitrogen, whatever. But the only difference is that the right glove instead of the left glove. It doesn't have to say it if you take a kill out of it, you get high.\r\n                            32:12\r\n                            And so I think when I read that that plants are such an amazing creatures that do things that, you know, we take for granted, we realize it\r\n                            32:29\r\n                            And this is another sign, another one of those signs. There's a reason that God is swearing by a plant, by the fig and the olive that obviously have significance as Dr. Khalifa mentioned and also from chemist's point of view.\r\n                            32:48\r\n                            So, by that I go back, start Sura 96. بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ\r\n                            32:55\r\n                            You have a question? (unintelligible).\r\n                            33:53\r\n                            The messenger: Actually, you have excellent varieties of figs and olives, you do have in Afghanistan. We have fantastic varieties of olives in Libya almost everywhere.\r\n                            If God is all merciful and knows the humans would make the same mistake – Why bother with all this – Answer = to save those who would make it to heaven.\r\n                            34:06\r\n                            (unintelligible). The messenger: Hey Robert, you wanted to say something. Robert: I remember asking you a question earlier about (unintelligible).\r\n                            34:32\r\n                            (unintelligible).\r\n                            34:39\r\n                            (unintelligible).\r\n                            34:49\r\n                            The messenger: Well, you see, God gave us the chance that when we blow that chance then we're really... one of the reasons for creating\r\n                            34:55\r\n                            this world is that creatures who end up in Hell will  not say \"you didn't give us another chance\r\n                            35:02\r\n                            or you didn't tell us how bad hell is.\" All these things, all their excuses are being nullified now, here.\r\n                            35:10\r\n                            So, the creature was given a second chance. He's really stupid, you know, if he doesn't take advantage of it.\r\n                            35:17\r\n                            You give somebody a key to a prison and he or she throws it away. Then, you give him or her another chance.\r\n                            35:25\r\n                            You give him a key, again. You say \"there's a treasure in this box. Don't throw the key away. Go open the box.\" And they still\r\n                            35:31\r\n                            throw the key away. This really... this really is stupid. So, this is lowliest of the lowly. It's worse than animals.\r\n                            35:38\r\n                            Here's the answer to the question. Did I get your question right?\r\n                            35:44\r\n                            Robert: Yeah, that answers that question. The messenger: What's the other question? Robert: Well, you just said that God knew that the human race, in general, was stupid. You know, that they were gonna take that key and throw\r\n                            36:01\r\n                            it away the second time. And I know that free will comes in....\r\n                            36:16\r\n                            The messenger: So, OK. You didn't catch my other part of the answer, then. This is to nullify the excuses. So, they will not say \"You didn't give us another chance.\"\r\n                            36:25\r\n                            Robert: No, I got that part. I just didn't understand. Human beings will suffer for eternity\r\n                            36:31\r\n                            and God knowing this will happen, why was he created?\r\n                            36:40\r\n                            The messenger: But you see, if we didn't have this second chance and we were thrown in hell, we will say \"You didn't give us another chance.\"\r\n                            36:49\r\n                            Now with this invitation in this world, you cannot say this is (unintelligible). (unintelligible).\r\n                            37:14\r\n                            Robert: God knew that we're gonna need a second chance... what I'm saying is that God knew that we're gonna go wrong. So, why would He...?\r\n                            37:20\r\n                            The messenger: No, no, no, there's so many millions of us who sees. All the people who died before 40 and all the people who.... there's still millions of us. So, for this relative few, it was worth it to create all this universe (unintelligible).\r\n                            37:38\r\n                            Robert: OK. That answers the question. The messenger: There's still, I mean. Think of all the... you and I, hopefully will make it to Heaven. You think of all the millions who died before 40. They would have been in Hell.\r\n                            37:52\r\n                            But as it is because of the creation of this universe, they're going to Heaven, instead.\r\n                            37:58\r\n                            So, God's mercy is saving all these millions of people.\r\n                            38:04\r\n                            Robert: So, the answer is that to worth it for the few to receive (unintelligible).\r\n                            38:11\r\n                            The messenger: I don't feel it's a few. If you think of it, If you're asking Mahmood Abib, he'll tell you the majority of Somalians are going to Heaven because they all die before 40.\r\n                            38:23\r\n                            The messenger: (unintelligible) is killing them before they get to 40 and this is a blessing.\r\n                            38:34\r\n                            A woman: (unintelligible).\r\n                            39:11\r\n                            The messenger: Under all circumstances. Yes. A woman: (unintelligible).\r\n                            39:37\r\n                            The messenger: And by this mercy millions of us are being saved who would have otherwise gone to hell. (unintelligible). This is a good enough reason.\r\n                            39:48\r\n                            Robert: (unintelligible).\r\n                            39:57\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: You can't ask a question. You have to answer the question.\r\n                            40:02\r\n                            A man: I mean, when everybody was over there before we came here. Did everybody actually said, when God asked us (unintelligible), \"do you believe in Me or not?\" Did everybody say \"no\" or\" \"yes\" or every said \"yes (unintelligible).\"\r\n                            40:22\r\n                            The messenger: No, we said \"we'd like to see a demonstration. Maybe, Satan can do it.\" Robert: Oh, that's what most people said?\r\n                            40:33\r\n                            A man: Let's say that God is in planet Mars. We were all there. This is a whole galaxy, a whole planet. Then, we made a mistake. This is exactly what we did. But God said \"OK. You guys, you criminals, you made a mistake. I'm not gonna send you yo hell. I give you guys another chance.\"\r\n                            40:51\r\n                            He put us all on a starship, sent us out here, (unintelligible) said \"OK. I'm gonna give you this body for all of you, this number of years. And I'm gonna test you guys. When you're done with this body, dispose this body. You can come back to me.\" (unintelligible).\r\n                            41:09\r\n                            The messenger: Those who redeem themselves can come back and join My Kingdom. Those who don't want, join Satan.\r\n                            41:16\r\n                            (unintelligible).\r\n                            41:35\r\n                            (unintelligible).\r\n                            41:43\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: And I guess after discovering this point, I can go to the next Sura, Sura 96\r\n                            41:53\r\n                            Muhammad was going to this cave for praying, and whatever reason he was going there and what is happening in this Sura\r\n                            42:03\r\n                            which is the first five verses which were revealed to him were the first verses that from the Quran that was revealed to Muhammad.\r\n                            42:12\r\n                            So, the story's that he... one day, he was in the cave and he heard a voice that told him to read which is the beginning of the Sura and he panicked and he thought that he's hallucinating and things like that and...\r\n                            42:32\r\n                            And then he heard the order to \"read.\" And Story is that he said that \"I can't read. How can I read?\" And then Gabriel told him \"read in the name of your Lord who created.\"\r\n                            42:50\r\n                            So, that's the story that I read, that I have heard it before, more or less the same. I don't know how true it is.\r\n                            42:58\r\n                            The messenger: It's not true. Dr. Sabahi: But this is the story that I read in a book that this is the way it happened to Muhammad in that Gabriel told him to read and he said \"I can't read.\"\r\n                            43:10\r\n                            And he said \"OK. Read.\" Then, I'll go to the Sura now. In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\r\n                            43:18\r\n                            [96:1] Read, in the name of your Lord, who created. [96:2] He created man from an embryo.\r\n                            43:28\r\n                            [96:3] Read, and your Lord, Most Exalted. [96:4] Teaches by means of the pen. [96:5] He teaches man what he never knew. [96:6] Indeed, the human transgresses.\r\n                            43:39\r\n                            [96:7] When he becomes rich. [96:8] To your Lord is the ultimate destiny. [96:9] Have you seen the one who enjoins. [96:10] Others from praying?\r\n                            43:50\r\n                            [96:11] Is it not better for him to follow the guidance? [96:12] Or advocate righteousness? [96:13] If he disbelieves and turns away.\r\n                            44:00\r\n                            [96:14] Does he not realize that GOD sees? [96:15] Indeed, unless he refrains, we will take him by the forelock.\r\n                            44:08\r\n                            [96:16] A forelock that is disbelieving and sinful. [96:17] Let him then call on his helpers. [96:18] We will call the guardians of Hell. [96:19] You shall not obey him; you shall fall prostrate and draw nearer.\r\n                            44:21\r\n                            The first five verses which are the the first revelations and as you see in the footnote, the code number 19 is all over those 5 verses and\r\n                            44:35\r\n                            also the whole Sura which are, which is consistent of  19 verses, overall. And it is a miracle in itself\r\n                            44:53\r\n                            God tells Muhammad [96:1] Read, in the name of your Lord, who created. [96:2] He created man from an embryo.\r\n                            45:06\r\n                            Whatever... this is, this is embryo which is the translated word  for 'Alaq. People have used this in different ways.\r\n                            45:24\r\n                            The way everyone to his own understanding of  maybe the universe, the biology or whatever it was or\r\n                            45:36\r\n                            whatever they got in understanding Quran. They have defined it  or interpreted it in different ways.\r\n                            45:48\r\n                            But what is clear, here God is saying that read and  read in the name of the One who created you\r\n                            46:01\r\n                            and the whole universe and He created man from an  embryo which I thought a lot about it. What does, what  \r\n                            46:14\r\n                            does that really mean, the embryo? Is that really the  physical meaning of the formation of the embryo\r\n                            46:24\r\n                            in an animal, any animal that leads to creation of the human being?\r\n                            46:37\r\n                            Or does refer to anything else? I couldn't  come up with anything else unless it's something else, Dr. Khalifa.\r\n                            46:47\r\n                            This referring to, to Muhammad and us, if we limit this Sura to the time \r\n                            46:59\r\n                            that's one problem that exists is that since this was  revealed to Muhammad, everyone tries to interpret  \r\n                            47:05\r\n                            the Sura to exactly the same time and what God gave at the time. But since this is the   book which is for all times and at any time  of history that I think people can understand  \r\n                            47:19\r\n                            it in its ways and if you stick with the facts that  you do thirteen or fourteen hundred years ago where\r\n                            47:27\r\n                            you didn't know a lot of things as science and  then you get yourself into trouble. But what it  \r\n                            47:35\r\n                            means is that God created the man from nothing, something  that He knows how He does it and from nothing that  \r\n                            47:43\r\n                            was nobody else can do the same thing that God is  doing. And then in verses 2, 3 to 5, He's telling us and  \r\n                            48:02\r\n                            prophet Muhammad that read, He's teaching, God is teaching  you by the means of the pen and He teaches man  \r\n                            48:11\r\n                            what he never knew. I think from these Suras up to this point, I came to the understanding that if we as Muslims\r\n                            48:26\r\n                            have read Quran and thought about it a little bit more carefully, I think, we should have been later in science more because there are so many facts that God is giving\r\n                            48:41\r\n                            us, you know, giving us the light. Says \"Ok. Look at  the sky. Look at the Sun. Look at the Dusk.\" You know, one day, sit outside and\r\n                            48:47\r\n                            see how (unintelligible) changes and think. But you kept saying that the world is flat. And then, He tells us about the plants.\r\n                            48:58\r\n                            He tells us about how beings are created and He  tells us that He's creating man from an embryo.\r\n                            49:06\r\n                            So, we took it as \"okay. This is God said so. So, don't  worry it.\" And then, Says [96:3] Read, and your Lord, Most Exalted.\r\n                            49:17\r\n                            [96:5] He teaches man what he never knew. So, if you don't read it... that's what I tell Ali all the time. Read the books. Do your homework.\r\n                            49:24\r\n                            If you don't read it, you'll never know what's going on.  But it is true that a very simple explanation  \r\n                            49:39\r\n                            understanding of the AYAs that I have is that you  start reading, God is coming and teach you. And also  \r\n                            49:51\r\n                            God teaches by means of pen, it has some other, I guess, some other (unintelligible)\r\n                            49:57\r\n                            that people who are dealing with pen have a very great  responsibility because those are the people who  \r\n                            50:04\r\n                            can have a great effect because a lot of people read. So, you can write something that you can mislead. You can write something\r\n                            50:13\r\n                            that you can lead. And I have seen that very clearly that after revolution or before revolution what aspects  \r\n                            50:23\r\n                            religion is concerned, after revolution in our country. And a simple thing, a simple one sentence  \r\n                            50:30\r\n                            or one paragraph how that simple one written document can change a whole nation, change the whole, in fact the whole, the life of the world and that is  \r\n                            50:50\r\n                            another indication that God is teaching you by the means of  the pen and it teaches you what you never knew but\r\n                            51:00\r\n                            you have to be a little bit willing to put in a little bit hard work on it and then God helps you. And I think I'll stop at  \r\n                            51:13\r\n                            these first five verses and...\r\n                            51:19\r\n                            (unintelligible).\r\n                            51:35\r\n                            Audience: You know, we were just a clot, an embryo. We started in that. Looking at this verse that says [96:1] Read, in the name of your Lord, who created\r\n                            51:45\r\n                            He definitely created us. He created man  from an embryo from something. It's where we started.\r\n                            51:51\r\n                            [96:3] Read, and your Lord, Most Exalted. [96:4] Teaches by means of the pen.\r\n                            52:01\r\n                            The way I look at it in Quran that we start learning from God. Actually, we got the first step to take.\r\n                            52:10\r\n                            First time, I actually came here, before I came  here my brother gave me a Quran and I said I mean  \r\n                            52:16\r\n                            my brother came here and  I was over there waiting and I sit sit on the couch and started reading it. It felt like, you know, after that I felt like myself I was an embryo\r\n                            52:27\r\n                            I was something that you know, I'm just, I'm just  starting. I started reading it and I started seeing  \r\n                            52:32\r\n                            things that I never saw, that I always asked when I went to Catholic school that I used to ask questions They were never actually answered. In there, they  were there. So, I mean I just felt like I was being  \r\n                            52:42\r\n                            born. Like I was being created right and then. For some reason, I mean, I just feel that those five  \r\n                            52:50\r\n                            will be for the Quran. A person is too weak and the  person who reads it and God wants him to be\r\n                            52:56\r\n                            a believer. He will create them right and there into a believer. He's not no longer a normal person  \r\n                            53:03\r\n                            I am no longer a normal person. I feel like I'm something, that I am here something\r\n                            53:11\r\n                            Quran, I mean, teaches us by the mean of the pen. I don't know if 20 years from now, that will\r\n                            53:17\r\n                            be, you know, go be the same thing. They can put it in the computer and it will be computer. Right now,\r\n                            53:22\r\n                            everything is written down. In back then, it  was written down, too. I don't know if it was before.\r\n                            53:28\r\n                            So, I think that that's what it means what  the Quran said. He wants us born\r\n                            53:33\r\n                            right then. Dr. Sabahi: Thank you. Ma Sha Allah. David: (Unintelligible). Let me ask you a question. (Unintelligible).\r\n                            53:59\r\n                            (Unintelligible)\r\n                            54:04\r\n                            The messenger: You're thinking of zygote, David. David: OK. Well, zygote is still way before an embryo\r\n                            54:10\r\n                            The messenger: Right. Zygote is an embryo, also.\r\n                            54:15\r\n                            David: I'm not sure because... (Unintelligible). You know, an embryo is way... (Unintelligible).\r\n                            54:35\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: I don't know Arabic but I looked up the meanings of 'Alaq. I think one of them is clot. And...\r\n                            54:44\r\n                            The messenger: It's not clot. That's not an accurate... the literal word means something that is hanging.\r\n                            54:51\r\n                            (Unintelligible).\r\n                            55:08\r\n                            The messenger: You know I met Dr. Bucaille. You know Dr. Bucaille? He wrote \"The Bible, The Qur'an and Science.\" I met him in Algeria and he was very angry at the word \"clot.\" Clot is a piece of clot that is like jelly and he said \"that is not what the human embryo is.\" And he was really angry. He \"never use clot again.\"\r\n                            55:30\r\n                            (Unintelligible).\r\n                            55:37\r\n                            The messenger: No, no. The word literally means \"something that is hanging.\" (Unintelligible).\r\n                            55:51\r\n                            The messenger: Right. It has cells but it's not a clot. It's a very active, very living group of cells that is dividing very fast. Clot is not even living, dead blood cells.\r\n                            56:06\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: Does 'Alaq mean \"Leech\" too? The messenger: Right. Yes. (Unintelligible).\r\n                            56:18\r\n                            Dr. Sabahai: Yeah, I read... I read in a Farsi translation or little bit interpretation that says \"maybe, this is because leech and sperm are somehow similarly shaped. This may be something that God is saying that He created man from whatever it is.\r\n                            56:43\r\n                            David: (Unintelligible).\r\n                            Translation debated – the word “clot” Vs “embryo”.\r\n                            57:05\r\n                            The messenger: David, technically an embryo is immediately after fertilization of the ova. You have an embryo, technically.\r\n                            57:16\r\n                            David: (Unintelligible). The messenger: I know. That's why the zygote, embryo, and fetus, all these are called embryos, technically. The definition of an embryo is fertilized ova. Is that correct?\r\n                            57:33\r\n                            The messenger: Yeah. Zygote is an embryo. (Unintelligible). Embryo covers a wide range, zygote to the fetus.\r\n                            57:51\r\n                            The messenger: Clot is not accurate at all. What is a clot?\r\n                            58:00\r\n                            (Unintelligible).\r\n                            58:52\r\n                            The messenger: But you see, David, there are two things against the word of \"clot.\" The first thing is clot is a dead object. Second is clot is not what the word is. In first translation, I thought clot would be accurate but it was not. Let's go back to Dr. Sabahi.\r\n                            59:30\r\n                            Audience: How come everybody always, everybody's arguing about one word, one sentence? How come they don't look at the whole picture, the whole sentence? Everybody is always arguing about the translation of one word. One word doesn't mean anything. It's the whole picture that it's giving.\r\n                            59:46\r\n                            (Unintelligible). Audience: Well, because if it's the translation in a better way but it becomes clot or embryo, the way I look at it even though it is clot or embryo. The way I look at it (Unintelligible).\r\n                            59:58\r\n                            David: I'm looking at the big picture. I'm looking at the big picture but I'm also looking at, you know, if I see something or you see something that you think doesn't really fit, then I think we should express it.\r\n                            1:00:15\r\n                            David: You know what I mean? Cause otherwise, why are you (Unintelligible)? And I don't need anything more than just this right now. This is the big picture.\r\n                            1:00:28\r\n                            The messenger: The choice of the translation reflects the growth of the translator. (Unintelligible).\r\n                            1:00:37\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: Yeah, going back to comment on what you said and also to mention what Dr. Khalifa was saying. I think one of... that's why Arabic version of the Quran is so valuable and it is so important that you can read it because one part that we miss is the music. I don't know how to say it, the music and the way it's written.\r\n                            1:01:02\r\n                            Because in Arabic if you read it, you see that every... especially these short Suras. The size of the Sura, verses\r\n                            1:01:09\r\n                            the way they sound, the music that goes with it, they change. So so  beautiful that you can, you know, in English it's partial.\r\n                            1:01:18\r\n                            And that one word is another thing that makes it translation and things like that very difficult as Dr. Khalifa mentioned. It's something that goes to\r\n                            1:01:29\r\n                            to perfection. From these discussions and arguments, you know, we just learn, move on... (Unintelligible). But as the Arabic  \r\n                            1:01:42\r\n                            word is very difficult to put it in one English word and say the same thing that is said there. One thing that I wanted to add to\r\n                            1:01:50\r\n                            (Unintelligible). OK. Another picture that you can get the first five verses reading the name of  \r\n                            1:02:07\r\n                            your Lord created and creation is  that the whole creation is evolved.\r\n                            1:02:14\r\n                            You can look at it as a whole. You don't have to  be able to read what is written here like being literate.\r\n                            1:02:22\r\n                            You can see and read without moving your lips. You can  see these things. So, God is... that's what makes it  \r\n                            1:02:30\r\n                            so beautiful that even for people who can't read. If you hear it and then even if you don't hear it, if you are willing enough to look at the  \r\n                            1:02:39\r\n                            things that God is telling you. He's telling you that He created and He created these things. So, the whole creation\r\n                            1:02:46\r\n                            is a big look. You just go out there that you can go, read it, and understand it. There are a lot of things\r\n                            1:02:53\r\n                            that is created from science. That's what the scientists do. They do see a lot of things. But they read it as you say it in English. You read it in the lines. I think creation is something that you can read\r\n                            1:03:07\r\n                            from between the lines if you are willing to, if you pay attention, we will accept the fact that\r\n                            1:03:13\r\n                            one night go out and look at the beautiful sky is that (Unintelligible) and you can read it and from a lot of other  \r\n                            1:03:19\r\n                            things that God is saying here. I'm gonna move  on, verse 6 and 7\r\n                            1:03:27\r\n                            [96:6] Indeed, the human transgresses. [96:7] When he becomes rich.\r\n                            1:03:32\r\n                            Whenever human beings feel that they are rich in anything, that money and only money, you will feel that you are rich in a lot of other things and then that's the time that  \r\n                            1:03:43\r\n                            you start worshipping yourself or your ego or whatever you have accomplished in the world. And that's the time that you start to transgress. You start  \r\n                            1:03:52\r\n                            to move away from God, forget God and go to the wrong path. So, if God is helping you to get rich and I said in any way that you can be rich  \r\n                            1:04:06\r\n                            and then you have to be very careful because, as has  been said repeatedly, that it is not you. It is your \r\n                            1:04:14\r\n                            work, you are working hard, you are putting a lot of effort  into it, but God is helping you to become richer  \r\n                            1:04:22\r\n                            in whatever you're doing, but be careful not to transgress. But God is saying that human beings, this is  \r\n                            1:04:28\r\n                            a nature of them. They just transgress. But He mentions in 8 [96:8] To your Lord is the ultimate destiny. \r\n                            1:04:35\r\n                            Don't forget. Whatever you get, whatever you accomplish, you have to finally die. You'll die and they put you  \r\n                            1:04:42\r\n                            depending on where you die, they're gonna put you in a coffin or they just put you in the ground and put a lot of dirt on you. And there you are and you can't take anything with you down there.\r\n                            1:04:54\r\n                            Then, God is again reminding us. [96:9] Have you seen the one who enjoins. [96:10] Others from praying?\r\n                            1:05:04\r\n                            And this is one of the very interesting few verses that comes together and we see very  \r\n                            1:05:09\r\n                            easily that there was a time that back in my  country before revolution, praying was something  \r\n                            1:05:17\r\n                            that if you did, was something out of civilization. You were old-fashioned, you believed in something which is not civilized, westernized  \r\n                            1:05:26\r\n                            and things like that and so people tend to say \"why you pray? If you wanted to pray, at least if you want  \r\n                            1:05:36\r\n                            to pray publicly because something that a lot of  people will tell you, make fun of you, but then after revolution  \r\n                            1:05:43\r\n                            it became forced. If you didn't pray, then you were in  trouble. There were times that at 12 o'clock, they would bring\r\n                            1:05:50\r\n                            you out, everyone was supposed to go to the mosque and pray which was another problem, you know. Whether you're praying for God or you're praying to show your\r\n                            1:05:57\r\n                            boss that I'm a good Muslim because it would have good effects on your salary or where you go in the future. But God is asking [96:9] Have you seen the one who enjoins. [96:10] Others from praying?\r\n                            1:06:14\r\n                            [96:11] Is it not better for him to follow the guidance? [96:12] Or advocate righteousness? Clearly, God is putting in question, question fashion [96:13] If he disbelieves and turns away.\r\n                            1:06:28\r\n                            [96:14] Does he not realize that GOD sees? And this is one thing that a lot of people don't realize or they may know it but they\r\n                            1:06:37\r\n                            they try to look the other way. God, again, is warning us, giving us some warning and cautioning us. Don't you think that God sees all what you do? And whatever you do is wrong, you know, He sees you.\r\n                            1:06:52\r\n                            And then in 15, God is getting tough. [96:15] Indeed, unless he refrains, we will take him by the forelock. [96:16] A forelock that is disbelieving and sinful. [96:17] Let him then call on his helpers. [96:18] We will call the guardians of Hell.\r\n                            1:07:11\r\n                            [96:19] You shall not obey him; you shall fall prostrate and draw nearer. So, in these last 5 verses, God is telling us story of the people who go the wrong path and God is telling us what He's gonna do with those and how they're gonna suffer in the\r\n                            1:07:38\r\n                            future that would come and they don't choose the right path which is the path of righteousness and the path of God. Overall, if we look at these verses starts with a lot of people may have for they see it just as\r\n                            1:08:01\r\n                            very disconnected, but it is very much connected as you see the whole story of the human being, the life, the way he's created, the way he transgresses, the way he becomes stingy, the way he drowns into materialistic things and then, you know,\r\n                            1:08:21\r\n                            goes away from God's path and becomes astray and then God is warning us at the end of the Sura that \"don't do this. Do whatever is required of you to do\r\n                            1:08:34\r\n                            and don't follow the crowd as has been  said frequently and try to stick to what is right which is in the book, in Quran and follow (unintelligible ).\"\r\n                            1:08:56\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: Do you have something? Audience: OK. Line 7 [96:8] To your Lord is the ultimate destiny.\r\n                            1:09:09\r\n                            Those lines actually remind me of what Dr. Khalifa keep saying, keep saying (unintelligible ) and you (unintelligible ).\r\n                            1:09:20\r\n                            The first thing, I mean, the thing that you most thought about during day. For some reason\r\n                            1:09:29\r\n                            humans tend to always look at themselves but I'd  like what I came today, I missed work. Somebody's  \r\n                            1:09:35\r\n                            working for me right now. And they say \"how come, how come  you come late from your breaks and you're always  \r\n                            1:09:40\r\n                            praying? How come you don't work and you get money?\" I said \"well, actually  \r\n                            1:09:46\r\n                            that's you think you do much better for yourself  because you don't know what you're saying but   I think for me to be there praying, it would be  much better for me.\" They would look at the money  \r\n                            1:09:57\r\n                            for themselves always buying nice cars, buying nice clothes even thought (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:10:05\r\n                            I mean, yes it is. People actually see  that and plus when they see other people  \r\n                            1:10:12\r\n                            praying and things like that, they get (unintelligible). They think they are more inferior. Right now for some reason, Church  \r\n                            1:10:21\r\n                            even thought people are saying nice things, like going down, the new generation who goes to the churches are offering and\r\n                            1:10:28\r\n                            they're not gonna get anywhere with it. They go and try  to go to college and try to become lawyers.  \r\n                            1:10:33\r\n                            and they never wanna see the instructions very good. I mean, I hear you showing them that's that's stupid.\r\n                            1:10:39\r\n                            You have to actually do your soul and you, cause if you did that, God's gonna give you everything.\r\n                            1:10:44\r\n                            I mean, you can become whatever you want.   Dr. Sabahi: Any other comments? We have 2 more minutes like this. Any other suggestions? This is a very... we didn't have \r\n                            1:10:55\r\n                            enough time, but it's a very important Sura. I definitely urge it at least somebody could read it in Arabic because it is beautiful. I know it is a privilege for people who know Arabic. Cause I don't know Arabic.\r\n                            1:11:10\r\n                            I can read it but I don't understand it. The messenger: Language doesn't matter. You're right. Quran has a beautiful, powerful and extraordinarily excellent literary, very enjoyable, but God says \"to the believers, it doesn’t make any difference.\"\r\n                            1:11:28\r\n                            So, I guess we will pause for tonight and we will have a number Fãtehahs to read. Today is August 4th. We read Sura 96.\r\n                            1:11:41\r\n                            Next Friday is August 11th, IN SHAA ALLAH, we'll finish, maybe, 97, 98, 99, 100, up to 105, let's say. Following Friday is August 18th, and we should finish the Quran, then. And Friday August 25th, we'll have the new translation. We'll start Al-Fãtehah.\r\n                            1:12:05\r\n                            So, we have to get it this way. The next week, IN SHAA ALLAH, we'll finish up to Sura 105 and we have to help our teachers do that. And the following Friday to finish so that we'll start Al-Fãtehah with the new translation, IN SHAA ALLAH.\r\n                            1:12:22\r\n                            So, our teacher next week will be Dr. Mahmoud Sabahi and his assistant, Dan. You're so good. You did a very good job this evening. Ma Sha Allah.\r\n                            1:12:42\r\n                            He's an excellent teacher. By the way, he presented to you the chemical (unintelligible). The stories in his life and job (unintelligible). And chemistry is a good (unintelligible). He made it so easy. He's a talented teacher. I can feel that. So, IN SHAA ALLAH, we'll make use of him more often. Philip?\r\n                            1:13:05\r\n                            Philip: (unintelligible) (unintelligible) She is now traveling.\r\n                            1:13:19\r\n                            go to Oregon to take care of some business.\r\n                            1:13:32\r\n                            The messenger: 31st of July\r\n                            1:13:45\r\n                            The messenger: Our teacher, don't worry. But Lory will be our teacher next week, finish to Sura 105. And then Ahmad Rayan, IN SHAA ALLAH, will be the following Friday to finish from 106 to 114, IN SHAA ALLAH. We need to read Al-Fãtehah for (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:14:10\r\n                            And Catherine, you forgot that your birthday's tomorrow. Catherine's birthday.\r\n                            1:14:19\r\n                            Martha is not here so (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:14:28\r\n                            but she's not here tonight. We read Al-Fãtehah for Philip and his wife, Emily\r\n                            1:14:37\r\n                            We read Al-Fãtehah for Maryam.

Let's make it a complete set of numbers.\r\n                            0:30\r\n                            The messenger: This is right?\r\n                            0:36\r\n                            The messenger: He's a member of the Quranic study, Fajr Quran study group. Look. He laughs. Ismail Barakat: And he just sits there and reads, yeah? The messenger: Yes.\r\n                            0:47\r\n                            He follows us. He asks questions sometimes. A woman: Like \"where is my breakfast?\"\r\n                            0:56\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: I think the person who's answering Emily, she understands Islam. The messenger: Yes, she speaks (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:05\r\n                            The messenger: You know, Ismail lowered his volume, his voice, yesterday. But still, Behrouz woke up and came here to say \"what's happened?\"\r\n                            1:13\r\n                            5 minutes after Ismail arrived, Behrouz comes. A woman: There was somebody in there, but I thought it was him, I thought maybe this was a fight about something.\r\n                            1:21\r\n                            The messenger: And that was when you were in your apartment, right? A woman: No. The messenger: No?!\r\n                            1:26\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: Right. See, I shouted from the other end when you got the message on your recording.\r\n                            1:32\r\n                            The messenger: You know, in Iran, the first commandment is that you must be in a state of grief continuously, and Behrouz recording our meetings, so far, there's nothing but laughing.\r\n                            1:45\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: What do they do when they meet each other? The first thing? \"Ah, it's nice to meet you. Oh great.\"\r\n                            1:57\r\n                            A man: Yeah. You didn’t hear about the Ayatollah. What Ayatollah does? Behrouz will tell us. The messenger: Oh, yes.\r\n                            2:04\r\n                            The messenger: You'd better see this. Khomeini, Khomeini is always serious in public and the people. When he goes to room, what does he do? Ismail Barakat: He breaks out.\r\n                            2:14\r\n                            Behrouz: \"You should sit up there, and you're like this, and you're like that. And then I see him,...\" (unintelligible).\r\n                            2:20\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: Because he kept telling me, come home, come home, and I say, \"well, you know, I'm too busy.\"\r\n                            2:25\r\n                            The messenger: The only reason he came in because I told him \"suppose you have a heart attack and die right now, who's gonna take care of the office?\" He said \"yeah, you're right.\" I said \"OK, consider that you're dead.\" And then he's coming here. I mean, this is...\r\n                            2:37\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: In fact, that's what I told Karl. I told him \"if anybody asks, say \"he kicked the bucket.\" The messenger: He's right. Ismail Barakt: He died. I don’t know when he's coming back.\r\n                            2:46\r\n                            The messenger: أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ\r\n                            2:51\r\n                            The Truth Prevails [10:79] Pharaoh said, \"Bring to me every experienced magician.\"\r\n                            2:58\r\n                            [10:80] When the magicians came, Moses said to them, \"Throw whatever you are going to throw.\"\r\n                            3:04\r\n                            [10:81] When they threw, Moses said, \"What you have just produced is magic, GOD will nullify it. GOD does not support the transgressors' work.\"\r\n                            3:13\r\n                            [10:82] GOD establishes the truth with His words, despite the criminals. [10:83] The only ones who believed with Moses were a few of his people, in spite of fearing the tyranny of Pharaoh and his elders. Surely, Pharaoh was much too arrogant on earth, a real tyrant.\r\n                            3:30\r\n                            [10:84] Moses said, \"O my people, if you have really believed in GOD, then put your trust in Him, if you are Muslims.\"\r\n                            3:37\r\n                            [10:85] They said, \"We trust in GOD. Our Lord, save us from the persecution of these unjust people.\r\n                            3:43\r\n                            [10:86] \"Deliver us, with Your mercy, from the disbelieving people.\" [10:87] We inspired Moses and his brother. \"Maintain your homes in Egypt for the time being, turn your homes into sanctuaries, and observe the Contact Prayers (Salat). Give good news to the believers.\"\r\n                            4:02\r\n                            [10:88] Moses said, \"Our Lord, You have given Pharaoh and his elders luxuries and wealth in this world. Our Lord, [the Saudis] only use them to repulse others from Your path. Our Lord, wipe out their wealth, and harden their hearts to prevent them from believing, until they see the painful retribution.\"\r\n                            4:23\r\n                            By the way, Muhammad and Jafar did some investigations on Eric and they found the telephone number that he had in his briefcase was\r\n                            4:31\r\n                            the Saudi embassy in Paris. Yep. Just like we suspected. I should've called Ihsan. I will.\r\n                            4:41\r\n                            He just sent me a letter very nice. Will it be very nice to the person who kicked him out, in that way? So, really, it's far.\r\n                            4:52\r\n                            89 Behrouz: Well, he missed the million dollars. The messenger: Yeah.\r\n                            4:58\r\n                            The messenger: All the signs were that, that he was far. He always complained about that business is bad, he is running out of money, he's very poor, he sleeps in a small room with a tiny bed, things like that, very perfect for his plan.\r\n                            5:12\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: He must be an accountant. The messenger: Accountant.\r\n                            5:18\r\n                            Behrouz: Well, at first glance, he had a small room. The messenger: Yes, prison. Saudi is known only for his plan. It's what they do. Too much money. 89.\r\n                            5:30\r\n                            [10:89] God said, \"Your prayer has been answered (O Moses and Aaron). This means \"your\" directs to two people.\r\n                            5:40\r\n                            [10:89] so be steadfast, and do not follow the ways of those who do not know.\" [10:90] We delivered the Children of Israel across the sea. Pharaoh and his troops pursued them, aggressively and sinfully. When drowning became a reality for him, he said, \"I believe that there is no god except the One in whom the Children of Israel have believed; I am a Muslim.\"\r\n                            6:02\r\n                            [10:91] \"Too late! For you have rebelled in the past. You have been wicked. [10:92] \"Today, we will preserve your body, to set you up as a lesson for future generations.\" Yet, many people are totally heedless to our signs.\r\n                            6:20\r\n                            Some important lessons you learn from here, first of all, imagine yourself\r\n                            6:25\r\n                            yourself, you, running away and somebody was running after you. And then you hit shore of the ocean,\r\n                            6:34\r\n                            but God is with you. So, what will happen? God will send a helicopter or something.\r\n                            6:42\r\n                            This is what happened to the Children of Israel. An army of Pharaoh was following them and they hit\r\n                            6:49\r\n                            the Red Sea, but God delivered them across the Red Sea. This shows you God's time. Some smart-alecky, he's a geologist,\r\n                            6:58\r\n                            explained that this is possible, geologically, because the rocks move this way and this way and the water will part. And you will have dry land between the water,\r\n                            7:15\r\n                            but he forgot a minor detail. Why did this happen when Moses and his people were there... Ismail Barakat: ...at that specific instance? The messenger. Right.\r\n                            7:25\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: And it might take years for the rocks to do what he's talking about. A man: How come it didn't happen again? The messenger: Right. Why on that moment?\r\n                            7:35\r\n                            The messenger: Best of timing. Even that... So, this tells you and me if we are\r\n                            7:49\r\n                            believers, we must trust in God that there is no obstacle or problem. Sura 72\r\n                            7:56\r\n                            فَمَن يُؤْمِنۢ بِرَبِّهِۦ فَلَا يَخَافُ بَخْسًۭا وَلَا رَهَقًۭا (72:13) Those who believe in their Lord shall fear no injustice and no suffering. None.\r\n                            8:08\r\n                            You must have confidence... we read before yesterday, or the day before how God told Moses mother \"if you're afraid, throw him on the river.\"\r\n                            8:15\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: Yeah, I know. It takes, it takes (unintelligible) in that position where you're told \"you have faith.\" And you're told to throw your baby in the water.\" The messenger: Right.\r\n                            8:31\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: Subhan Allah. She must have... but Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala says that He strengthened her heart.\r\n                            8:37\r\n                            The messenger: Because (unintelligible). Ismail Barakat: Because... For me I would say \"hold it. Anybody else up there?\" Astaghfirullah. I hope this never happens to me. You say it, I have to get tested.\r\n                            8:58\r\n                            The messenger: You already gave yourself a test. Ismail Barakat: Huh? The messenger: You already gave yourself a test. Ismail Barakat: Astaghfirullah. The messenger: Yes. Ismail Barakat: I have to go through that.\r\n                            9:05\r\n                            The messenger: You have to repent. No, you already did it. And you flunked. You said \"if it were me...\"\r\n                            9:10\r\n                            The messenger: Well, I have told all the folks here not to even answer a question like that. Don't put yourself in those positions. Ismail Barakat: I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,\r\n                            9:19\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: This is why... The messenger: This is why you're in Tucson. Ismail Barakat: How do we think this back? A man: The angel is here. The messenger: You repent. Ismail Barakat: Astaghfirullah.\r\n                            9:28\r\n                            A man: The angel is here, you know. Take it seriously.\r\n                            9:37\r\n                            The messenger: Cause Satan tried to mimic God's voice, like you do it every time, and tell you to go to the highest building and then jump.\r\n                            9:44\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: Yeah, but if He says that, I'll tell Him \"no.\"\r\n                            9:50\r\n                            The messenger: I'm just telling you. God is saying that. Ismail Barakat: I still tell Him \"no.\" God will not order me to do... The messenger: Exactly. Because of the law. God says\r\n                            10:00\r\n                            \"God does not advocate (vice)\" إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَأْمُرُ بِٱلْفَحْشَآءِ (7:28) God does not advocate things like that.\r\n                            10:09\r\n                            The messenger: Get where you sit, Amir. A man: Actually, it was a test for Moses' mother, too. The messenger: Yes, of course.\r\n                            10:18\r\n                            The messenger: She was a believer, as stated in the Quran. The other lesson is... Ismail Barakat: Hold on one moment. Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala didn't just tell her to throw, dump him in the river. The messenger: Right.\r\n                            10:29\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: He said لَا تَخَافِى وَلَا تَحْزَنِىٓ ۖ إِنَّا رَآدُّوهُ إِلَيْكِ وَجَاعِلُوهُ مِنَ ٱلْمُرْسَلِينَ (28:7)\r\n                            10:37\r\n                            The messenger: Hey, you're memorizing the Quran now. Ismail Barakat: Wallahi, I'm not memorizing, just this one. The messenger: This is what I'm saying.\r\n                            10:45\r\n                            The messenger: This is what I'm saying. The messenger: When I met this guy, he didn't know (unintelligible) was in the Quran. Ismail Barakat: I think that's what I said.\r\n                            10:52\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: She got a lot of... The messenger: I should have recorded you before and after. Even his Arabic was broken, you know.\r\n                            Pharaoh died a believer – BUT did not nourish his soul via the worship practices.\r\n                            11:00\r\n                            A man: It's recorded. The messenger: Yes. That's right. The messenger: The second great lesson that we learn from here is that Pharaoh died a believer. He really was a believer,\r\n                            11:15\r\n                            but he didn’t have time to develop his soul. This is why (10:)91 says \"too late!\"\r\n                            11:23\r\n                            This is very important and this is consistent in the Quran. It says \"on the Day of Judgement, it will not benefit\r\n                            11:28\r\n                            any believing soul its belief if it did not gain  from its belief by developing the soul.\"\r\n                            11:38\r\n                            لَمْ تَكُنْ ءَامَنَتْ مِن قَبْلُ أَوْ كَسَبَتْ فِىٓ إِيمَـٰنِهَا خَيْرًۭا (6:158) In a soul that did not believe and earn from the belief, this growth and development which is the 5 Prayers, the fasting of Ramadan, commemorating God most of the day, etc. etc.\r\n                            11:54\r\n                            (Unintelligible). The messenger: No. No. (Unintelligible).\r\n                            12:09\r\n                            The messenger: But no, he really believed. He really believed. Ismail Barakat: Well, with this kind of evidence who wouldn't believe. The messenger: Yeah, I mean, he's dying. Ismail Barakat: Even Rasool would.\r\n                            12:20\r\n                            The messenger: Yeah. It's too late. The messenger: In fact, this is what they all say at the time of death \"just send me back.\" This is after the angles beat them up.\r\n                            12:30\r\n                            And they discover they were wrong. Or Pharaoh said it. Yes, for the angels.\r\n                            12:39\r\n                            When drowning became imminent.\r\n                            12:46\r\n                            And the third big lesson is in (10:)92 that tells us that God's miracle of preserving\r\n                            12:52\r\n                            Pharaoh's body. Have you seen his body in the...? Did you go to mummies' room? Did you see that? Bloody awful. Why?\r\n                            13:05\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: I'd much rather disappear than look like that. The messenger: Oh, I see. Yeah, but I mean the (unintelligible) said \"you enjoyed visiting it\" or were you...\r\n                            13:13\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: Wallahi, there is a... The messenger: How old were you? (unintelligible).\r\n                            13:22\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: Well, you know, partly because there is an aura of death and what's the word I'm looking for, in that room. The messenger: awe.\r\n                            13:31\r\n                            Isamil Barakat: It's you're happy to be out of there. The messenger: If you ask me, I enjoyed it. I definitely loved it.\r\n                            13:39\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: No, no, The messenger: Sammy got a pick at it. Isamil Barakat: Yeah, I would imagine. Behrouz: How did it look like? How did the body look like?\r\n                            13:47\r\n                            The messenger: Dried up, dried up bodies. The messenger: They uncovered the faces of some of them. You can see the teeth and the hair. Yes. Just dried up, slightly freeze dried human human blood.\r\n                            14:01\r\n                            The messenger: The skin is all dried up.\r\n                            14:06\r\n                            The messenger: Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Ismail Barakat: Like leather. The messenger: The short fellow. Cause they had salt...\r\n                            14:17\r\n                            Isamil Barakat: Ramses? The messenger: Not Ramses. Merneptah. Ismail Barakat: Everybody identifies this Pharaoh as Ramses. Ramses II. The messenger: No, it's not Ramses.\r\n                            14:29\r\n                            Isamil Barakat: Although the most, I'm sure I didn't see anybody else. Cause He is the one, at least that is the one I know. The messenger: Yes, I know him very well. They took him to Paris\r\n                            14:40\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: Because it was rotting. The messenger: He was ill. Ismail Barakat: You know, when they took him there, when he arrived, they fired the 21-gun salute.\r\n                            14:55\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: ‌Because he is a king after all. The messenger: Yep. I don't know... Ismail Barakat: There was a military\r\n                            15:02\r\n                            guard of honor and they fired the 21-gun salute. The messenger: He was a very important king. Ismail Barakat: He was a king. That's right. He was rotting. He was sick.\r\n                            15:15\r\n                            The messenger: You've heard this joke about this statue that in fire, because it is standing up? Ismail Barakat: Standing up for what? 4000 years?\r\n                            15:22\r\n                            The messenger: No, but in Cairo standing up in the middle of railway station. Ismail Barakat: And he's peeing on the people.\r\n                            15:30\r\n                            The messenger: This is what Sammy used to say. Because there's a fountain of water coming under him. The messenger: Sammy was only 3 years old. He said \"Ramses is going wee wee.\" Ismail Barakat: And on all these people. And on these people.\r\n                            15:46\r\n                            The messenger: Right. Every time, never failed. He said \"Ramses is going wee wee.\" This is what he used to say when going to the bathroom.\r\n                            15:57\r\n                            \"I wanna go wee wee but...\" \"Ramses is going wee wee.\" So, the joke is that he told the prime minister\r\n                            16:05\r\n                            \"I'm getting tired of this. (unintelligible) is sitting down, so camel and the horse, this and that\"\r\n                            16:10\r\n                            \"from standing up, I'm getting tired. So, get me a horse or something.\" So, the prime minister thought\r\n                            16:16\r\n                            it was very serious matter. So, he went and talked to the  president, Mubarak. And then Mubarak said\r\n                            16:21\r\n                            \"well, let's answer him personally.\" So, here comes the prime minister with Hosni Mubarak. \"I said a horse, not a bald donkey.\"\r\n                            16:37\r\n                            \"coming back with a donkey.\"\r\n                            16:43\r\n                            The messenger: In Arabic, it's much funnier. Ismail Barakat: No, it's equally funny. The messenger: In English, too.\r\n                            16:51\r\n                            So, before we close here because let the people who work go to work. You don't go to work, right?\r\n                            17:00\r\n                            92. Ismail Barakat: It's a good excuse to go late.\r\n                            17:06\r\n                            So, (10:)92 says \"Today, we will preserve your body, to set you up as a lesson for future generations.\"* And there is an asterisk here.\r\n                            17:14\r\n                            The footnote says... excuse me. *10:92 God endowed the Egyptians with the exclusive knowledge of mummification. Today, Pharaoh's mummified body is on display at the Cairo Museum.\r\n                            17:29\r\n                            This is really profound cause only in that era, that period of time that they were mummifying the bodies and look what God is saying. The Arabs had no idea about this.\r\n                            17:40\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: The Arabs, they had no idea about anything. The messenger: about anything...\r\n                            17:46\r\n                            The messenger: Cause it says [10:92] \"Today, we will preserve your body... see? (10:92) فَٱلْيَوْمَ نُنَجِّيكَ بِبَدَنِكَ \"your body\" God is saying. We're gonna preserve your body to be a lesson for future\r\n                            17:56\r\n                            generation. Oh, yes, yes. Ok. Tell her to have a bon voyage. Are these your thoughts? Behrouz: Yes. I'll be back.\r\n                            18:07\r\n                            The messenger: You're taking your wife to the airport, right? Oh, oh, you're picking breakfast. OK. Hurry up. Susan and Lisa... Be back here Behrouz.\r\n                            18:15\r\n                            (unintelligible).\r\n                            18:22\r\n                            The messenger: I'll open this door for you. I will open that for you.\r\n                            18:29\r\n                            The messenger: OK. Ask Isamil any questions you want. Cat said\r\n                            18:37\r\n                            \"Ok, guys, if you don't wanna...

I have the easy mission.\"\r\n                            19:00\r\n                            A man: Little cat come here. Little cat. It's trying over lap. He sits there, especially.\r\n                            19:23\r\n                            A woman: Yeah, you invited it. (unintelligible)\r\n                            19:34\r\n                            A man: Ok, little cat. Little cat.

When Dinky picks something up and I tell her to laugh and she gets up on my leg. The messenger: Mã Shã Allãh.\r\n                            20:10\r\n                            The messenger: What type is it that change and grows to 300 pounds?\r\n                            20:15\r\n                            A woman: I think she's done her growing unless I make her fat. IN SHAA ALLAH, I think she's growing.\r\n                            20:23\r\n                            The messenger: أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيم بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\r\n                            20:30\r\n                            [23:1] Successful indeed are the believers; [23:2] who are reverent during their Contact Prayers (Salat).

[23:8] When it comes to deposits entrusted to them, they are trustworthy. And they honor their agreements.\r\n                            21:08\r\n                            [23:9] And they observe their Contact Prayers (Salat) regularly. See, how important the Prayers are? They're repeated twice.\r\n                            21:16\r\n                            The beginning of reverence in the Prayer, and here to regularity of the Prayers.\r\n                            21:24\r\n                            The latest miracle of the Contact Prayers is: 17171717171715. It's a multiple of 19. So, if you miss one, it's gonna be 17171617171715.\r\n                            21:45\r\n                            A woman: How many do you need to miss then if you miss one so you can make contact? The messenger: We need to do research on that. Actually, it's a very interesting question.\r\n                            21:55\r\n                            A man: If you miss Maghrib, it will be 14... if you miss another one, it will be 13. And if you miss, Fajr, it will be 15. The messenger: 14, yes.\r\n                            22:07\r\n                            A man: Not 16, never 16. The messenger: Yeah , I know.

That time, too.\r\n                            22:21\r\n                            The messenger: Were you here?

So, if you all forgot, it would be 16. So, 16 is possible.\r\n                            22:39\r\n                            A man: 16 is possible. Yeah, sure. The messenger: It's really amazing. It's so simple, simple mathematically. I mean, this is now covering every aspect of the Prayer,\r\n                            22:56\r\n                            the number of Ruku's, the number of Sujuds, the number of Tashahuds.\r\n                            23:04\r\n                            number 9 [23:9] And they observe their Contact Prayers (Salat) regularly. number 10 [23:10] Such are the inheritors.\r\n                            23:12\r\n                            [23:11] They will inherit Paradise, wherein they abide forever. And then there's a report of accurate embryology.\r\n                            23:21\r\n                            12, this is what Behrouz was asking about yesterday.\r\n                            23:26\r\n                            [23:12] We created the human being from a special kind of mud. This is the initial creation.\r\n                            23:35\r\n                            [23:13] Subsequently, we reproduced him from a tiny drop, that is placed into a well protected repository.\r\n                            23:44\r\n                            [23:14] Then we developed the drop into a hanging (embryo), then developed the hanging (embryo) into a bite-size (fetus),\r\n                            23:53\r\n                            Maybe \"a bite-size\" is not very good. The messenger: Is it true, the bite? Yeah.\r\n                            24:04\r\n                            The messenger: I think that is a good translation for that.\r\n                            24:10\r\n                            The messenger: The fanatic Muslims say it looks like something you bit.\r\n                            24:18\r\n                            (Unintelligible). A man: tiny, tiny fetus The messenger: Yeah. smaller. Yeah. Small fetus, tiny fetus.\r\n                            24:34\r\n                            A man: What stage is that? 14 days, the egg and still... The messenger: Ok. This is like 2 months.\r\n                            24:45\r\n                            A man: 2 months. 2 months is when the (Unintelligible) and the shape... but you cannot tell which animal it is. All animals are the same at that stage.\r\n                            24:58\r\n                            The messenger: Is that right? A man: All animals are the same.\r\n                            25:05\r\n                            The messenger: [23:14] into a bite-size (fetus), then created the bite-size (fetus) into bones, then covered the bones with flesh. Then, produced a new creature. Most blessed is GOD, the best Creator.\r\n                            25:22\r\n                            The messenger: It's one of the amazing things that we witnessed at first (unintelligible), remember?\r\n                            25:36\r\n                            The messenger: I love your reaction to my question. Such supportive sister. Like yesterday, seems like yesterday.\r\n                            25:55\r\n                            A man: When we were born, God assigned a soul. A soul came from the world of souls, then how come we don't remember at that stage?\r\n                            26:08\r\n                            The messenger: Cause that's not the only time you don't remember. Remember when you were a year and a half and your mom spanked you?\r\n                            26:15\r\n                            A man: No, that's what I mean. The first 2 years, probably 3 years. The messenger: Yeah. Because there is a capacity of memory in your brain.\r\n                            26:23\r\n                            (unintelligible).\r\n                            26:30\r\n                            The messenger: You need to add memory cards, if you want to remember everything.\r\n                            26:37\r\n                            The messenger: Some hardware. A man: The soul needs some other tools. Yes, like the brain.\r\n                            26:43\r\n                            The messenger: Yes. But the soul uses this physical body to grow, this wild horse. As you do more important things, other things are pushed away out of your memory.\r\n                            26:55\r\n                            But actually, they never go away. You know of the subconcious. It goes into a storage, like the tapes that Lisa plays back and forth. It's that storage, memory.\r\n                            27:15\r\n                            But you know, really we were just one cell. Each of us was one cell and differentiated,\r\n                            27:21\r\n                            divided and differentiated into kidneys and livers, hearts, lungs. One cell, nose, eyes.\r\n                            27:34\r\n                            Look at the eyes, how the eyes move. Such sleepy eyes. Some bright eyes.\r\n                            27:45\r\n                            It's a ball with pressure with liquid inside that is precise pressure.\r\n                            27:51\r\n                            If it's a little bit more, the eyes will bug out, like Barbara Bush. I mean, slightly, if it's slightly less, it's a problem.\r\n                            28:07\r\n                            A woman: She has, what, the Graves' disease? The messenger: Yes. A woman: That's her thyroid.\r\n                            28:15\r\n                            The messenger: It's caused by the thyroid at that point. A woman: Do you have something about memory storage, you know, to the beginning of life? Because I do remember\r\n                            28:28\r\n                            The messenger: It's all there. A woman: There was a reaction, I can't fast forward and rewind, but...\r\n                            28:34\r\n                            The messenger: Yes, as you get more things, other things are pushed down into subconscious, the storage.\r\n                            28:39\r\n                            Everything is there. Actually, it's out there in the atmosphere, every voice, every picture.\r\n                            28:47\r\n                            A woman: And the angels have the recordings. And I always thought the angels were being turned to my body, but then I realized it was because my heart pumps, when all those things happen, by the will of God, the angels must be involved in it.\r\n                            29:13\r\n                            The messenger: No, it's a mechanism. I couldn't turn the car engine on, if there is no engine here. There's a mechanism. There is a gas that the fuel pump.\r\n                            29:29\r\n                            The messenger: Yes. As a matter of fact, when our cars break down, when the mechanism fails, then God provides another mechanism, which is your engine.\r\n                            29:37\r\n                            But there is a mechanism, when the starter works, when the fuel pump pumps fuel,\r\n                            29:45\r\n                            when the pistons spark, when fire... there's something. So, this is the way our body works. Subhan Allah.\r\n                            30:01\r\n                            A woman: I'm just trying to make the connection between the recording angels and the video tape.\r\n                            30:09\r\n                            The messenger: This is simplifying it, a dramatization. A woman: Yes.\r\n                            30:17\r\n                            The messenger: Our heart is an incredible pump. (Unintelligible).\r\n                            30:25\r\n                            I think still, you know, recently. (Unintelligible). This is their function. They are happy about it.\r\n                            30:42\r\n                            If you take the heart by itself, you can have it work properly. In fact, heart transplant doctors could do that.\r\n                            30:48\r\n                            (Unintelligible).\r\n                            when the Miracle is presented – why do people not respond. Miracle of the word GOD explained.\r\n                            31:01\r\n                            10, 15 college students came here and Edip spoke to them from, from Pima College  and he explained to them the miracle,\r\n                            31:16\r\n                            that there's a message from God to the world and gave them all  the details they wanted about an hour and a half,\r\n                            31:25\r\n                            wanted them to ask questions and he told them \"we have  a Quranic study tonight. So, would you... if you have  \r\n                            31:35\r\n                            any questions, you can come and discuss the matter  further, but they never showed up, not but one. Not one of them\r\n                            31:41\r\n                            showed up. We have high school kids. He presents the miracle to them give them details, but there is no  \r\n                            31:49\r\n                            response. And we're just wondering what is wrong with the  people. Here's a message from God, proven to  \r\n                            31:56\r\n                            be from God, it tells us who we are, why we're here,  where we're going and how to attain perfect happiness  \r\n                            32:04\r\n                            now and forever, but they're just like... they're  under hypnosis. Nothing moves them and we're just  \r\n                            32:14\r\n                            wandering. It's a kind of amazing phenomenon. So,  we're working on, on simplifying this and working  \r\n                            32:23\r\n                            on ways and means of perfecting the message and  how to present it to the people to motivate them,\r\n                            32:31\r\n                            make them realize that there is a message from God,  the first physical evidence in history, and all the  \r\n                            32:40\r\n                            benefits that follow from this. So, I'm going to  share with you these simple but powerful facts. \r\n                            32:49\r\n                            They're very simple to understand, simple to present and simple  to appreciate. And hopefully this, we will perfect the  \r\n                            32:56\r\n                            message somehow. So, what I'm going to talk with  you today is just the word \"God\" in the Quran.\r\n                            33:05\r\n                            It's a very simple, very simple matter. There's a scripture  from God. The most important word in it is the  \r\n                            33:14\r\n                            word \"God.\" I'm gonna look just at that which is only one millionth of the total miracle.\r\n                            33:22\r\n                            OK. Number one: the occurrence of the word \"God\" in the whole book. All of you know this. 2 6 9 8.\r\n                            33:36\r\n                            19 x 142. Ok. Then, you take every verse in the Quran  wherever you see the word \"God\", it is very simple  \r\n                            33:51\r\n                            as you see, and add the numbers of these verses, ok, all the verses in the Quran that have the word  \r\n                            34:07\r\n                            \"God\" in them, just add their numbers. They give you  1 1 8 1 2 3.\r\n                            34:17\r\n                            19 x 6217. You know, this alone really, this alone tells us  that this book is from God. It is not human-made.\r\n                            34:30\r\n                            Who designed this? And I have gone through length  to show you how we, college graduates, are unable  \r\n                            34:41\r\n                            to keep track of these. I mean, the message is  already here, it's already written down. It's in front of\r\n                            34:46\r\n                            us but we're having a heck of a time keeping  track of the words and the sentences. And we keep  \r\n                            34:56\r\n                            screening mistakes. It's very simple.  Sometimes we just reverse 3 2, make it  \r\n                            35:01\r\n                            23, when we count or when we add. But  this alone proves that the book is from God.\r\n                            35:15\r\n                            OK. Next. This is a new discovery by Muhammad  Abib. Now that we see there's 19 as a common  \r\n                            35:28\r\n                            denominator, he looked at all the verses in the  Quran that are number 19 or multiples of 19 and  \r\n                            35:38\r\n                            counted the word \"God\" in them. Very simple process.  These are the 19 multiples verses. So, it's in Sura Al-Baqarah, number 2\r\n                            35:55\r\n                            looks at verse number 19 and counts the number of the word \"God\" in it.   Then, goes to verse number 38, number 57 and so on. And  he did this in the whole Quran. Now, the word  \r\n                            36:06\r\n                            \"God\" in those verses 133. Nobody in the  whole world knows except the believers, know this.\r\n                            36:23\r\n                            This is a new discovery. It's been already faxed  to India, Canada and some other places. As soon  \r\n                            36:30\r\n                            as these things come up, we have a fax machine now, and it's... everything is faxed around the world.\r\n                            36:37\r\n                            But anyway so, now, we carry this miracle one  step further and it shows the more intricacy\r\n                            36:46\r\n                            of the miracle. It should convince anybody that we  have a book from God. But the word \"God\" is very  \r\n                            36:55\r\n                            important. So, it doesn't stop here. The next item, the sum of all the occurrences of the word \"God\" in  \r\n                            37:05\r\n                            the verses whose numbers are not multiples of 19, it follows. 19, not multiple verses,\r\n                            37:20\r\n                            and it only follows from that. It's 1 1 7 9 9 0. Yes. This is a mathematical property, says Edip.  \r\n                            37:36\r\n                            Even though it is a mathematical property,  I was... I was oblivious to it for a while, then I said  \r\n                            37:41\r\n                            \"yeah, since the verses that are multiples of 19  have a multiple of 19 number words of \"God\"\r\n                            37:47\r\n                            then it follows, you just subtract this from this and you have that. But it still is an important fact for us  \r\n                            37:54\r\n                            to remember even though it is a mathematical  property. It doesn't stop here. The Suras\r\n                            38:02\r\n                            whose number of verses is divisible by 19, this also is a new discovery by Muhammad Abib, the Suras whose\r\n                            38:09\r\n                            number of verses is divisible by 19, that  is any Sura that has 19 verses or 38 verses,\r\n                            38:15\r\n                            the only these 2 kinds. There are Sura's number 47  which has 38 verses, Sura 82 which has 19 verses  \r\n                            38:23\r\n                            Sura 87, 19 verses and Sura 96 consists  of 19 verses. The word \"God\" occurs in these  \r\n                            38:30\r\n                            Suras 27 times, one time, one time and one time,  respectively. By adding these Sura numbers plus  \r\n                            38:39\r\n                            the occurrence of the word \"God\", the total is 342. So, Suras,  first occurrences 342, 19 x 18.\r\n                            39:03\r\n                            These are all the Suras in the Quran that  consist of a number of verses that is divisible by 19, and again we are counting the word \"God\" in them. The next item,... take care to erase number 1 here.\r\n                            39:26\r\n                            It's just the word \"God.\"\r\n                            39:31\r\n                            Number 6. Ok. The first set of Quranic  initials is, as you know, A.L.M. in chapter 2,\r\n                            39:40\r\n                            we get to A.L.M. The last initial is  in chapter 68. It's a natural  \r\n                            39:47\r\n                            division in the Quran. Let's call this the  initialed section from Sura 2 to Sura 68,  \r\n                            39:54\r\n                            and count the word \"God\" in it. Sure enough, it's a multiple of 19. Initialed section from the first  \r\n                            40:02\r\n                            initialed Sura to the last initialed Sura. The  number of the word \"God\" is 2 6 4 1, (19 x) 139.\r\n                            40:25\r\n                            Now, these are physical facts. It is nobody's  opinion. Nobody can say \"in my opinion, the number\r\n                            40:33\r\n                            the number of occurrences of the word \"God\" in the initiated section of the Quran is   2641.\" Nobody can say that. It's a physical  fact just like the sun rises from the east.  \r\n                            40:45\r\n                            Nobody can argue about it. Maybe, the Arabs do. It follows since the total in the whole Quran is  \r\n                            41:00\r\n                            a multiple of 19, it follows that outside  the initialed section, the number of occurrences\r\n                            41:06\r\n                            of the word \"God\" is 57, 19 times 3. Not only that, you take those 57 occurrences outside the  \r\n                            41:14\r\n                            initialed section, add the Suras and verses, the total, yes, it's a multiple of 19.\r\n                            41:27\r\n                            And now we have interlocking the word \"God\" with  the last two sentences in Sura 9. As you know,\r\n                            41:35\r\n                            they are fake. The idol worshipers were trying to honor the prophet Muhammad in the  \r\n                            41:45\r\n                            same way as the Christians try to honor Jesus. They made up those two verses. So, Sura 9 is either  \r\n                            41:59\r\n                            129 verses, as we inherited from  the fabricators. Or now, we know it is 127.\r\n                            42:10\r\n                            Which one is it? The word \"God\" gives us a clue. Because if  you take all the Suras whose number of verses ends  \r\n                            42:22\r\n                            with the digit 9, just look at the whole Quran  and take all the Suras where the number of  \r\n                            42:33\r\n                            verses end with this digit, 9, and count the word \"God\" in them, without Sura 9. Let us assume\r\n                            42:41\r\n                            that the right number is 127. Well, you can include it if  you want, but if you include Sura 9 in the  \r\n                            42:49\r\n                            in this group, the number of the word \"God\" is not  divisible which tells us this is the wrong number  \r\n                            42:56\r\n                            of verses. If you put 127, it is divisible. Let  me, let me... it's stronger than that. The Suras that  \r\n                            43:09\r\n                            end with the digit 9 are Suras number 10, 15, 29, 43, 44, 48, 52, 57, 81, 82, 87, 96 and 104.\r\n                            43:21\r\n                            They consist of 109 verses, 99 verses 69, 89, 59, 29, 49, 29,  29, 19, 19, 19 and 9. So, you can see that all of them  \r\n                            43:34\r\n                            have a number of verses that ends with the digit  9. When you count the word \"God\" in these, you have 190.\r\n                            43:45\r\n                            19 x 10. Now look in the Quran and take all the Suras in the Quran  \r\n                            43:52\r\n                            whose number of verses ends with the digit 7,  including Sura 9, and these of Sura's numbers.\r\n                            44:03\r\n                            Sura number 1 is 7 verses, as you know. 1, 9, which is 127, 25, 26, 45, 86, and 107. Their number of verses are 7, 127, 77,\r\n                            44:17\r\n                            227, 37, 17, and 107. You count the word \"God\" in  them and you get 209. This is 19 x 10.\r\n                            44:35\r\n                            This is 19 x 11. So, the word \"God\" just  like the mathematical code guards, protects\r\n                            44:46\r\n                            the Quran from any distortion. The word \"God\"  by itself does that because it tells you that\r\n                            44:54\r\n                            Sura 9 consists of 127 verses, not  129. Because if you take what we inherited\r\n                            45:00\r\n                            from the fabricators, this, this phenomenon will  disappear. Yes, both of them will disappear.\r\n                            45:13\r\n                            The number of occurrences of the word \"God\" from the  beginning of the Quran to the end of Sura 9,\r\n                            45:22\r\n                            from the first verse in Sura 1 to the last  verse of Sura 9 which is 127, the occurrences\r\n                            45:32\r\n                            of the word \"God\" is 1 2 7 3. This is very unusual  because this is not true of every Sura in the Quran  \r\n                            45:47\r\n                            but God saw to it that at the end of Sura, verse 127 of Sura 9, the total occurrences of word \"God\" is a\r\n                            45:56\r\n                            multiple of 19. Ismail Barakat: Not only that, but it is also 127. The messenger: Yes. 1 2 7 3. So, if\r\n                            46:07\r\n                            we take the 129 verses that we inherited  from the falsifiers, you'll have 1 2 7 4,\r\n                            46:14\r\n                            not a multiple of 19. Finally...  the only one... one word \"God\" in the last 2 verses, right?\r\n                            46:29\r\n                            Yeah, the last item here, add the number of  Sura 9, oh yeah, let's add the number of Sura 9\r\n                            46:48\r\n                            plus the number, the correct number of verses 127 plus the number of occurrences of the word \"God\"\r\n                            46:59\r\n                            168, the total is 304. 19 x 16. This is just  the word \"God.\" And there are, of course, many other\r\n                            47:14\r\n                            crucial words like the word \"Rasool\", the word  \"Quran\", the word \"one.\" It just goes on and on, but this  \r\n                            47:23\r\n                            is just the word \"God.\" And when I simplify... Abdullah? Did you  just discover that? You discovered it.\r\n                            47:33\r\n                            Where else will you have miracles (unintelligible) on you? Ok. Abdullah, what is it? Mã Shã Allãh\r\n                            47:41\r\n                            Abdullah: There are 85 chapters that have the word \"God\" in it. And if you take chapter number, no, no, no, don't add that... chapter number\r\n                            47:56\r\n                            and the last verse that \"God\" occurs, for each chapters, add  them up. Divisible. \r\n                            48:04\r\n                            The messenger: Is that the same one that we have in appendix or different? Ok. Abdullah: For example, chapter, chapter 1, the last word that \"God\" occurs is number 2.\r\n                            48:14\r\n                            The messenger: Yes. Abdullah: So, 1 plus 2 is 3. If you take chapter 9, the last verse is 127 not 129.\r\n                            48:22\r\n                            The messenger: Right. Abdullah: You have 9 plus 127. And that's for all 85 chapters. The messenger: Yes.\r\n                            48:28\r\n                            Abdullah: I think the result is 9101. I'm not sure but it's divisible by 19. The messenger: Yes. 9101 is divisible.\r\n                            48:39\r\n                            The messenger: OK. I'm gonna repeat just in case you, you missed it. The word \"God\" occurs... this is very... this is a good one, beautiful.\r\n                            48:49\r\n                            The word \"God\" occurs in 85 Suras in the Quran. You take the number of the Sura and add it to  \r\n                            48:56\r\n                            the number of the last verse where you see the  word \"God\" in that Sura. For example, in Sura Al-Fãtehah\r\n                            49:01\r\n                            Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem (1:1) Al hamdu Lillahi Rabbil ‘Alameen (1:2)\r\n                            49:06\r\n                            is number 2. So, 1 plus 2 is 3 for  Sura 1. You do this in every Sura of the 85\r\n                            49:12\r\n                            Suras where the word \"God\" occurs. The number of the Sura plus the last verse where\r\n                            49:18\r\n                            you see the word \"God.\" And this, of course, has to  do with the Sura 9. When it comes to Sura 9, you add\r\n                            49:25\r\n                            127 and not 129. And you do this in all 85 Suras, add up. The total is 9101 which is a multiple of 19.\r\n                            49:36\r\n                            Tooboo Ela Allah. Repent.\r\n                            49:50\r\n                            Alhamdu Lillah. We praise God. Wa Ash-hadu Alla Elaha Ella Allah Wahdahu La Shareeka Lah.\r\n                            50:03\r\n                            Last week, Mohtasham gave us an excellent Khutba. Let  me, let me come back to this. But I just always forget  \r\n                            50:15\r\n                            this new discovery that came to us in the mail from  Turkey and it has to do with verse 3:81. This\r\n                            50:25\r\n                            happens quite often in the Quran where you have a  statement in the Quran and the opponents will come up\r\n                            50:33\r\n                            with something contradictory to it. But then  God puts the answer to their claims somewhere else  \r\n                            50:43\r\n                            in the Quran. For example, verse 3:81 talks  about the Messenger of the Covenant.\r\n                            50:50\r\n                            It says that after all the prophets, and this is any translation  will tell you about it. After all the prophets have  \r\n                            50:56\r\n                            come to this world and delivered their scriptures  and the messages, a messenger will come to  \r\n                            51:01\r\n                            unify, purify, consolidate these messages into  one. This is verse 3:81. When you show this to the  \r\n                            51:10\r\n                            idol worshipers, they say \"that one is Muhammad. That messenger of the Covenant is Muhammad.\"\r\n                            51:17\r\n                            Even though the verse is very clear that it is not  Muhammad because it begins by saying \"God made  \r\n                            51:24\r\n                            a covenant with the prophets.\" We all recognize the  Prophet Muhammad as a prophet, even they do.\r\n                            51:32\r\n                            He was the last prophet. Therefore, he must be included  in that statement because God did not say\" He  \r\n                            51:39\r\n                            made a covenant with the previous prophets or  the prophets before you.\" God said \"He made a\r\n                            51:45\r\n                            covenant with the prophets.\" So, the answer to this  claim is in 33:7 where God says \"I made the covenant  \r\n                            51:56\r\n                            with the prophets including you, Muhammad.\" So,  this is at the very... at the other end of the Quran. So,  \r\n                            52:04\r\n                            it shuts them up. Now, the discovery that Edip Yuksel made... Ismail Barakat: No, it doesn't, Rashad. It doesn't. The messenger: Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah. It doesn't shut them up, but\r\n                            52:11\r\n                            shuts up that particular item. Edip's friend in Turkey counted the verses from 3:81 to the answer to their  \r\n                            52:22\r\n                            claim 33:7 and found that the number of verses is a multiple of 19. 3192.\r\n                            52:29\r\n                            The messenger: Yes. The Basmalah are verses. The Basmalahs are unnumbered verses, as we know, from this miracle on the wall where we did not  \r\n                            52:40\r\n                            count them and the whole number is a multiple of 19. And when our brother, Ali Fazeli,\r\n                            52:46\r\n                            suggested that we put 0 for every Basmalah  in the Quran, we thought this whole thing will  \r\n                            52:51\r\n                            collapse. We shouldn't have thought that. But we put  the zeros there and sure enough it still was  \r\n                            52:57\r\n                            a multiple of 19. Ismail Barakat: Subhan Allah. The messenger: We are the luckiest people on earth. There is no question about it.\r\n                            53:08\r\n                            Anyway, with your help, all of us together... pardon? Shakira. We know we are lucky? A woman: Only we know that we are lucky. The messenger: Yes. That's what counts.\r\n                            53:21\r\n                            The messenger: Anyone who believes will discover that too  because they will join the lucky, luckiest. \r\n                            53:28\r\n                            I mean to be born at this particular time in this  particular place and all the circumstances that  \r\n                            53:33\r\n                            brought us together. When you reflect on your  circumstances, you can see how God directed  \r\n                            53:39\r\n                            you to this particular situation. Obviously, because  you deserve that. OK. Mohtasham gave us an excellent  \r\n                            53:47\r\n                            Khutba, last week. And he talked about the  responsibility which goes with the extreme  \r\n                            53:53\r\n                            great fortune that God bestowed upon us. His blessing and grace comes with responsibility.\r\n                            54:01\r\n                            What is our responsibility towards us, our souls, the real persons? Because God spreads it out to us,\r\n                            54:11\r\n                            He tells us exactly what to do. So, I want to add to what Mohtasham said is that we now recognize that  \r\n                            54:20\r\n                            the human being consists of the soul, that's the real person, and the body. The soul... when a baby\r\n                            54:32\r\n                            is born, the soul is assigned to that body.  And the first thing that as soon as Shakira\r\n                            54:42\r\n                            pulls the baby out, the baby cries. Then, she gives him  a spank. You spank the babies when you deliver them?\r\n                            54:48\r\n                            No? Do they cry anyway? They always  cry. Sometimes they don't cry? They all cry.\r\n                            55:01\r\n                            I see. It helps them breathe. I think they cry because they get trapped. But, really I'm curious. All of them\r\n                            55:08\r\n                            100 percent of them cry. Or do you get sometimes the baby that's still under   anesthesia or something? Shakira: No, if there is a problem, they don't cry. The messenger: Oh, I see. When the baby comes, if the baby doesn't cry \"uh-uh.\"\r\n                            55:24\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: There's another thing. Wouldn't you cry if you came to this place? The messenger: Yes, that's the whole idea.\r\n                            55:37\r\n                            The messenger: So, what do we do... what do we do for the body? Ok. Let's  say what are our responsibilities to the body?\r\n                            55:49\r\n                            We go to school. We study and take exams. Just ask, Farhad, how he likes that. Today, it is big, big prelim test.\r\n                            56:04\r\n                            And how many years we go to school? So  many years we go to college.\r\n                            56:12\r\n                            Is college fun, Beth? All the tests and the studying,  how hard it is. Then, you go to grad school \"oh no.\"\r\n                            56:29\r\n                            I used to get mad at people who tell me \"it's cool. It's fun.\" You know, how... I said \"you wanna take my  \r\n                            56:36\r\n                            place.\" Ok. Then, after that, we work. Every morning,  we set the alarm. We go to work, we drive in the traffic.  \r\n                            56:52\r\n                            And in Tucson, it's not as bad as other places. We drive in the  traffic and we go to face the boss. Everyone hates the boss. I don't know why.\r\n                            57:07\r\n                            And work until five o'clock.  A woman: We don't hate you. The messenger: I'm not the boss. This is a whole different system here.\r\n                            57:17\r\n                            In Heaven, there's no jealousy. There's competition and  everybody is helping his competitors to go ahead.\r\n                            57:24\r\n                            This is in God's system. God removes all  jealousy and hatred from His people.\r\n                            57:30\r\n                            But this is what we do for the body. And why all this? Why do we do all this for twenty or thirty years  \r\n                            57:37\r\n                            for forty years? You start working when you're 30 and retire when you're 65, okay. 35 years. We do all  \r\n                            57:44\r\n                            this because we want to support ourselves, have a  nice home, a nice spouse, nice children, nice clothes,\r\n                            57:51\r\n                            nice food for the body for 35 years. Okay. What  do we do for this? You know, after, after this 35  \r\n                            58:04\r\n                            years, what happens to the body? Ismail Barakat: Cancer. The messenger: Now, it is the soil. It vanishes. Here the soul doesn't  \r\n                            58:16\r\n                            vanish. You can think of the soul at the time of  birth as a baby. What do we do for the soul? This  \r\n                            58:24\r\n                            is the responsibility that Mohtasham mentioned  last week. God tells us that we must do the five  \r\n                            58:33\r\n                            prayers. We must feed the soul. Ask the average person  on the street \"What did you give your body today\r\n                            58:39\r\n                            for meals? What did you give you, the soul, today for meals?\" They'll have to think long and hard. Tell them, ask them  \r\n                            58:47\r\n                            not today, say \"for the last years, how many meals did you give to yourself?\" They feed the body, they do  \r\n                            58:56\r\n                            all this work for the body. But for the soul, they do nothing. Do you have a question? A woman: Yeah. You know, I was thinking  \r\n                            59:04\r\n                            about this when I was coming in the plane because this was going on in my mind, that we have a system\r\n                            59:10\r\n                            where we give credits. I mean like, if you do Zakat, you get 50% and then for Salat you have\r\n                            59:16\r\n                            25% and for Hajj you have, you know? The messenger: Yes, you accumulate credits. You accumulate credits as you go right and left.\r\n                            59:24\r\n                            Every time you say \"Subhan Allah.\" You see, this  is... in fact, this brings me to the next one. Thank  \r\n                            59:30\r\n                            you for reminding me and this involves Mohtasham, also.  Yesterday, I made a terrible terrible  \r\n                            59:36\r\n                            mistake. Anyway, you get the idea here that this is  an eternal entity. This is the real soul and\r\n                            59:44\r\n                            in proportion to this work we should do, work for  the soul except God is just and He doesn't give  \r\n                            59:52\r\n                            us even one hundredth of this work that we do  for the body to survive 35 years. This eternal\r\n                            Dr. Rashad Khalifa makes a terrible mistake – Advises a follower “these two pills will remove your flu” – major error was not invoking God when giving the pills.\r\n                            1:00:00\r\n                            entity doesn't take much to develop and God makes  it very easy as long as you, you observe God.\r\n                            1:00:09\r\n                            And this is, bring me to the mistake that I did with Mohtasham yesterday. Mohtasham was not feeling good.\r\n                            1:00:15\r\n                            So, anyway, I repented. I fell prostrate and I asked for forgiveness. But I went and got him\r\n                            1:00:23\r\n                            two pill and I told him... listen to this. I  said \"these two pills will remove your flu, will heal you.\"\r\n                            1:00:34\r\n                            Yousuf, Joseph, the prophet, said the same thing and he stayed in the prison for a few years.\r\n                            1:00:40\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: 7 years. The messenger: Well, we don't know how many. I mean, this is a remark I want to... you are very special people.\r\n                            1:00:51\r\n                            And you have a lot of responsibility. And you must watch what you're saying. And I bet you anything... I mean, how  \r\n                            1:00:59\r\n                            many, how many years you think we should go  to prison for... when we think about it?  \r\n                            1:01:06\r\n                            So, immediately, I caught myself. Actually, I scared him to death because I came back and said Mohtasham  \r\n                            1:01:12\r\n                            \"where are the pills?\" And he looked and \"I swallowed  them already.\" I said \"I made a terrible mistake.\"\r\n                            1:01:26\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: I gave you the wrong pills. The messenger: \"We deserved it cause you didn't tell me this is wrong.\" Alright. You know, we didn't say \"by God's  \r\n                            1:01:35\r\n                            grace and and His help these pills...\" Well,  how many, how many of us make this mistake?\r\n                            1:01:41\r\n                            How often? Don't answer me.\r\n                            1:01:47\r\n                            Tonight, IN SHAA ALLAH, we are on page 64 starting at verse 110. And our teacher is Dr. Mahmood Sabahi.\r\n                            1:02:06\r\n                            Just make sure to keep the children quiet. Dr. Sabahai: أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ\r\n                            1:02:18\r\n                            As usual we ask God to help us to understand His words better and remove all  the barriers from our hearts.\r\n                            1:02:29\r\n                            verse 110, I start from verse 110 page 64. \r\n                            1:02:35\r\n                            [3:110] You are the best community ever raised among the people: you advocate righteousness and forbid evil, and you believe in GOD. If the followers of the scripture believed, it would be better for them. Some of them do believe, but the majority are wicked.\r\n                            1:02:54\r\n                            111 [3:111] They can never harm you, except for insults. If they fight you, they will turn around and flee. They can never be victorious.\r\n                            1:03:06\r\n                            112 [3:112] humiliation is their lot wherever they go, unless they abide by GOD's covenant, and the people's covenant. They incurred wrath from GOD, consequently, they were committed to disgrace. This is because they rejected GOD's revelations, and used to kill the prophets unjustly. This is because they disobeyed and transgressed.\r\n                            1:03:31\r\n                            113 [3:113] They are not all the same; among the followers of the scripture, there are those who are righteous. They recite GOD's revelations through the night, and they fall prostrate.\r\n                            1:03:47\r\n                            114 [3:114] They believe in GOD and the Last Day, they advocate righteousness and forbid evil, and they hasten to do righteous works. These are with the righteous.\r\n                            1:03:59\r\n                            115 [3:115] Any good they do will not go unrewarded. GOD is fully aware of who the righteous are.\r\n                            1:04:10\r\n                            [3:116] Surely, those who disbelieved can never be helped by their money or their children against GOD. They have incurred Hell, wherein they abide forever.\r\n                            1:04:21\r\n                            117 [3:117] The example of their spending in this world is like a violent wind that hits the harvest of the people who wronged their souls, and wipes it out. GOD never wronged them; it is they who wronged themselves.\r\n                            1:04:38\r\n                            I stop at 117 and go back to 110.\r\n                            1:04:49\r\n                            I believe as far as I could look through the verses  that we have studied up to this point from the  \r\n                            1:04:57\r\n                            beginning of the Quran that this is the first  verse that God is talking about the community.\r\n                            1:05:09\r\n                            God is saying that you are the best community  ever raised among the people and you advocate  \r\n                            1:05:20\r\n                            righteousness and forbid evil. If we review what  we have seen through, through the Al-Baqarah, this  \r\n                            1:05:30\r\n                            second Sura and third up to this point, what  we have been told, what we have been taught is that  \r\n                            1:05:42\r\n                            what we have to do as individuals basically, what we have to do to be righteous,\r\n                            1:05:49\r\n                            how do we have to behave in, in the society and  how to take care of ourselves as far as we are  \r\n                            1:05:57\r\n                            concerned and our own interests are concerned. Now, we  are seeing God telling us about a community.\r\n                            1:06:04\r\n                            I go to the verse 84 of this same Sura  not too far. It's page 61. The title of it is:\r\n                            1:06:16\r\n                            Make No Distinction Among God's Messengers. I see a  relationship between this community that God\r\n                            1:06:23\r\n                            is saying that we raised among you people. These  people who are in this community, they are saying  \r\n                            1:06:31\r\n                            [3:84] \"We believe in GOD, and in what was sent down to us, and in what was sent down to Abraham, Ismail, Isaac, Jacob, and the Patriarchs, and in what was given to Moses, Jesus, and the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction among any of them. To Him alone we are Muslims.\"\r\n                            1:06:52\r\n                            In this community if you look at this verse 84, it almost covers everyone that you can see around you in this world\r\n                            1:07:04\r\n                            at the current time. If someone can believe and can  uphold this verse and see the world and see the  \r\n                            1:07:16\r\n                            people as all people who only believe in God and  what was sent down to the people from Him, then  \r\n                            1:07:27\r\n                            you won't see any, any problem in the world. So, this  is one characteristic of those people who are\r\n                            1:07:34\r\n                            in that community. Then, I go to two verses, 103 and  104, the same just page 63.\r\n                            1:07:46\r\n                            Unity: a trait of the believers [3:103] You shall hold fast to the rope of GOD, all of you, and do not be divided.\r\n                            1:07:53\r\n                            So again, another characteristic of these people, this community, the people in this community is that they are... all of them hold fast to the rope of God because He is the One that everybody is holding to.\r\n                            1:08:08\r\n                            And do not be divided. This is a very important thing, you know,  don't be divided. How, why people get divided?\r\n                            1:08:15\r\n                            What is the reason for the world being such a nasty  place to live in? What is all the division? What is it for?\r\n                            1:08:23\r\n                            You see, in the book, in this book, in Quran, you don't see any trace of race, color, nationality  \r\n                            1:08:30\r\n                            whatsoever or whatever we can think of. So, even  religion, everybody, all the people who are part of  \r\n                            1:08:37\r\n                            that best community, they are all the same because  they hang on to the rope of God and they follow  \r\n                            1:08:45\r\n                            what He tells them to follow. So, in this community,  there is room for everyone regardless of what  \r\n                            1:08:51\r\n                            shape they are, what color they are, what race they  are. There is nothing except believing in God and  \r\n                            1:09:00\r\n                            being righteous. I continue on 103. God says  you used to be enemies and He [(the God)] reconciled your hearts. By His grace, you became brethren. You were at the brink of a pit of fire, and He saved you\r\n                            1:09:17\r\n                            Look, you look around in the world everywhere you see, there's fire, there's bloodshed, there's killing,\r\n                            1:09:24\r\n                            there's unrest, there is disease. [3:103] GOD thus explains His revelations for you, that you may be guided.\r\n                            1:09:31\r\n                            I think 104 is a good one, too, related to same, to  the same issue.\r\n                            1:09:37\r\n                            [3:104] Let there be a community Here God says \"let there be a community\" [3:104] ...of you who invite to goodness, advocate righteousness, and forbid evil. These are the successful ones.\r\n                            1:09:48\r\n                            In this one, in this verse, God is telling that He puts, lays the conditions. If there wants to be a good community  of you, you have to invite to goodness, advocate  \r\n                            1:10:01\r\n                            righteousness and forbid evil. And then, God says that you are the best community ever raised. This  \r\n                            1:10:10\r\n                            is something current, it's at the present time  and the future. He's talking to some people. He's  \r\n                            1:10:17\r\n                            telling them \"you are the best.\" If one... if we think  we are, then we have to analyze ourselves every  \r\n                            1:10:25\r\n                            day and see whether we are upholding what I read  to you from those verses that which is related to  \r\n                            1:10:32\r\n                            the conditions. You cannot say that okay, I go to  this mosque, I do my prayers and I'm one of the  \r\n                            1:10:41\r\n                            ones who is the happiest, who is the best. We have  to self-analyze ourselves all the time and to be  \r\n                            1:10:47\r\n                            able to be part of that community to advocate  righteousness and forbid evil. These two words  \r\n                            1:10:54\r\n                            \"advocating righteousness and forbidding evil\", it  is part of the responsibility of the believers,\r\n                            1:11:03\r\n                            the people who believe in God. Because up to this  point, whatever you saw was something related to  \r\n                            1:11:08\r\n                            your personal duties by praying, like fasting, like Hajj, like Zakat, whatever. But now, you are part of a  \r\n                            1:11:17\r\n                            community. This is your social responsibilities to  advocate righteousness. How do you, how do you do it?\r\n                            1:11:24\r\n                            God doesn't tell you how to do it. So, you have  to find a way to do it the best way possible.  \r\n                            1:11:29\r\n                            If you are part of that community that God is  saying that you are the best ever raised among  \r\n                            1:11:35\r\n                            the people, then the responsibilities that go with  it is huge. And how you approach it, how you do it,\r\n                            1:11:43\r\n                            it's something that it depends on personal views  and how you approach it. But if you keep God\r\n                            1:11:50\r\n                            only as your final goal and you could get rid  of all the egotistical issues, if you can break  \r\n                            1:12:00\r\n                            down that part of you who is not clean or it's  not purified, then you can do a good job. So, \r\n                            1:12:14\r\n                            you have to work on yourself and then you can do the  rest of it much easier. And if the followers of the  \r\n                            1:12:24\r\n                            scripture believe, it will be better for them. So,  if you face other people from other religions,\r\n                            1:12:36\r\n                            if they follow, if they follow or they accept what you  tell them, that's good for them. If not, so be it. Some of  \r\n                            1:12:46\r\n                            them do believe but the majority are wicked. I go to  111. God is promising you that the people that this  \r\n                            1:12:57\r\n                            community who He is, who He is raising and is the best  community, He promises them that they can never\r\n                            1:13:08\r\n                            be harmed. You know, nobody can harm you. They can  insult you, they can probably possibly make some\r\n                            1:13:18\r\n                            hardship for you which would be passing, it's not  gonna last, but God says that\r\n                            1:13:24\r\n                            [3:111] They can never harm you. If they fight you, they will turn around and flee. They can never be victorious.\r\n                            1:13:31\r\n                            This is a promise that the victory is for the people who  are worshipping God alone and are righteous and they forbid evil.\r\n                            1:13:41\r\n                            [3:112] Humiliation is their lot wherever they go, unless they do abide by GOD's covenant, and the people's covenant.\r\n                            1:13:48\r\n                            If you see 112, I guess it's  for the first time. Forgive me if I'm not, I'm not right but I think back to my memory, I think  the first time that God mentions the people's  \r\n                            1:14:03\r\n                            covenant in addition to God's covenant. It's just  right after that. So,\r\n                            1:14:09\r\n                            [3:112] Humiliation is their lot wherever they go, unless they abide by GOD's covenant, and the people's covenant.\r\n                            1:14:16\r\n                            So, if you are part of that community, if you are a member of that  best community ever raised among the people, then  \r\n                            1:14:25\r\n                            you have to abide by God's covenant, first God  alone, worshiping Him alone, and people's covenant.\r\n                            1:14:32\r\n                            What does that mean? The understanding that I  have and definitely it's open for discussion  \r\n                            1:14:38\r\n                            is the fact that if your faith... if you are part of  that community, if you belong to that community, if  \r\n                            1:14:47\r\n                            you have all those characteristics, then you  make a covenant. You have to be faithful. We\r\n                            1:14:54\r\n                            have to be like brothers and sisters and it's the  family. It is a community, as I said, regardless of  \r\n                            1:15:01\r\n                            all the issues that cause, in this world, all the division and all the hatred and the wars and the fights and the battles.\r\n                            1:15:09\r\n                            [3:112] They incurred wrath from GOD, consequently, they are committed to disgrace. This is because they rejected GOD's revelations, and [used to] kill the prophets unjustly. This is because they disobeyed and transgressed.\r\n                            1:15:23\r\n                            At this part of  the verse, God is telling us \"those who violate any,\r\n                            1:15:32\r\n                            violate any of those two covenants, this is what is  happening to them.\" If you wanna see a little bit  \r\n                            1:15:39\r\n                            more from what we have studied up to this point,  I go to Sura 2 verses 60 and 61 which is page 9.\r\n                            1:15:51\r\n                            This is about Moses and the children of Israel. [2:60] Recall that Moses sought water for his people. And we said, \"Strike the rock with your staff.\" Whereupon, twelve springs gushed out therefrom. Thus each tribe knew their own water. Eat and drink from GOD's provisions, and do not roam the earth corruptingly.\r\n                            1:16:13\r\n                            [2:61] Recall that you said, \"O Moses, we can no longer tolerate one kind of food. Call upon your Lord to produce for us such earthly crops as beans, cucumbers, garlic, lentils, and onions.\"\r\n                            1:16:28\r\n                            He said, \"Do you wish to substitute that which is inferior for that which is good? Maybe, you should go back to Egypt, where you can find what you asked for.\"\r\n                            1:16:40\r\n                            They were condemned to humiliation, and disgrace, and they incurred God's wrath.\r\n                            1:16:45\r\n                            That is because they used to disbelieve in GOD's revelations, and killed the prophets unjustly. That is because they disobeyed and transgressed.\r\n                            1:16:53\r\n                            So, what this seems and God is  telling us about what has happened in the past\r\n                            1:16:59\r\n                            is that if you become fortunate enough to become part  of that community and then you cannot uphold your  \r\n                            1:17:10\r\n                            covenant, then you're gonna be humiliated. God is gonna reject you and humiliate you.\r\n                            1:17:24\r\n                            And if you go and take a look around, especially  it doesn't matter in different religions. Muslims  \r\n                            1:17:36\r\n                            who have the Quran. What is going on in the  Muslim world these days?\r\n                            1:18:00\r\n                            We see, we see that the people who were given this scripture, who  God sent the messenger for them and who they  \r\n                            1:18:13\r\n                            believed, the people who believed that they are the  ones who are the Muslims in this world,\r\n                            1:18:21\r\n                            they are going through the most difficult times right  now and the only reason, I think, I can find\r\n                            1:18:32\r\n                            for this is not holding up the God's covenant  and not holding the people's covenant although  \r\n                            1:18:39\r\n                            they try, at least, they think they're trying but  they are going the wrong way to create that best  \r\n                            1:18:50\r\n                            community because they are aware of this verse and  similar verses in the Quran, but they are missing  \r\n                            1:18:57\r\n                            the main point which is God's revelations and God  and worshiping God alone and getting rid of all  \r\n                            1:19:05\r\n                            the idols that jump up from everywhere in those  countries. I go to 113. Here, God talks about as the  \r\n                            1:19:17\r\n                            title says: Righteous Jews & Christians. [3:113] They are not all the same; meaning the Jews and Christians from the other, the followers of the other scriptures. Among, ok.\r\n                            1:19:31\r\n                            [3:113] They are not all the same; among the followers of the scripture, there are those who are righteous. They recite GOD's revelations through the night, and they fall prostrate.\r\n                            1:19:39\r\n                            So, this is another good example of a community which all the boundaries are broken. If there are Jews or Christians who are upholding the  \r\n                            1:19:55\r\n                            God's scripture, they believe in God and they  prostrate and God is telling us, you know, I don't have  \r\n                            1:20:01\r\n                            to go and find it. There are people who are Jews and Christians in the world who are righteous,\r\n                            1:20:08\r\n                            who recite God's revelations. How they do it, I don't  know. But God is telling me that they do that. So,  \r\n                            1:20:14\r\n                            they could be part of that community, that good  community that is raised among the people, the best community.\r\n                            1:20:20\r\n                            [3:114] They believe in GOD and the Last Day, Two major conditions of being a believer.\r\n                            1:20:25\r\n                            [3:114] ...they advocate righteousness and forbid evil, The same 2 duties that I mentioned in 110, God is mentioning in 110.\r\n                            1:20:37\r\n                            [3:114] ...they advocate righteousness and they forbid evil, and they hasten to do righteous works. They are with the righteous.\r\n                            1:20:47\r\n                            115 [3:115] Any good they do will not go unrewarded. GOD is fully aware who is righteous.\r\n                            1:20:54\r\n                            Clear, there is  no explanation for this, very clear said. 116\r\n                            1:21:00\r\n                            [3:116] Surely, those who disbelieved will never be helped by their money or their children against GOD. They have incurred Hell, wherein they abide forever.\r\n                            1:21:14\r\n                            I take you to verse 10 of this same Sura, Sura 3  \r\n                            1:21:23\r\n                            Disbelievers always ultimate losers. See the difference in the language of the two verses.\r\n                            1:21:31\r\n                            [3:10] Those who disbelieve cannot be helped by their money, or children, against GOD. They are the fuel of]Hell.\r\n                            1:21:39\r\n                            But here God says \"surely  those who disbelieve will never be helped by their  \r\n                            1:21:44\r\n                            money for their children against God.\" Over there in verse 10, it seems to me at least that God  \r\n                            1:21:52\r\n                            is telling us \"they cannot be helped\", but it seems  that a door is left open for them so that the  \r\n                            1:21:59\r\n                            righteous people can go, do their duties, you know. Tell them to forbid evil and they can advocate  \r\n                            1:22:08\r\n                            righteousness, tell them what the right is what the  wrong is. But if you do and and you see examples I\r\n                            1:22:15\r\n                            guess every one of us has that experience that  you try, you try to give the message and try\r\n                            1:22:24\r\n                            to tell them what is right, what, what God wants them  to do, but they don't, they don't listen. And here\r\n                            1:22:33\r\n                            God says surely those who disbelieve will never  be helped by their money or that this is\r\n                            1:22:38\r\n                            the ultimate or by their children against God. They  have incurred Hell wherein they abide forever.\r\n                            1:22:48\r\n                            And 117 [3:117] The example of their spending in this world is like a violent wind that hits the harvest of people who wronged their souls, and wipes it out. GOD never wronged them; it is they who wronged themselves.\r\n                            1:23:04\r\n                            I had a little bit of a hard time  to exactly understand what this verse means but  \r\n                            1:23:10\r\n                            I give you what my understanding is from it. It  seems that it is alluding to the fact that people\r\n                            1:23:27\r\n                            who have a lot of money that they can spend and  they spend it and they try to spend it for\r\n                            1:23:35\r\n                            in the, in the, in... as they're considering for God or they... the  donations, they go on TV and donate $1,000,000 to  \r\n                            1:23:45\r\n                            this good cause because it's tax-deductible  and they make sure that they show the numbers on  \r\n                            1:23:51\r\n                            TV and everywhere. And they do these things and  then they go and corrupt the... using the Quranic\r\n                            1:24:04\r\n                            warning, they corrupt the earth and then expect, they  expect that God should give them back something.\r\n                            1:24:10\r\n                            They donated a million dollar or hundred dollar  or one dollar for God and then, you know, why they  \r\n                            1:24:18\r\n                            didn't get anything back. And I think God is saying that whatever... God never wrongs them. God  \r\n                            1:24:25\r\n                            doesn't want bad for anyone. So, whatever we do  is a consequence of what... whatever we get is a\r\n                            1:24:33\r\n                            consequence of whatever we have done. And God says very clearly He \"never wrong[s] them; it is they who [do wrong] themselves.\"\r\n                            1:24:42\r\n                            I wanna stop here  and let go for some discussions and comments  \r\n                            1:24:48\r\n                            and questions but before that I have to mention  something about... because this is about the best  \r\n                            1:24:55\r\n                            community and I was watching 60 minutes last  Sunday and if you ask people who have traveled  \r\n                            1:25:05\r\n                            around the world, at least, if you say \"give me  a country that is one of the best ones I can  \r\n                            1:25:11\r\n                            go and live there\" usually Switzerland is one of  the names that comes out. You know, whoever have...\r\n                            1:25:16\r\n                            I have been there once with you about five days,  especially Zurich is a beautiful place. It's so  \r\n                            1:25:21\r\n                            clean. First time I was there, I thought that people  wash their cars three times a day because it's  \r\n                            1:25:28\r\n                            so clean and so nice, no police in the streets. You can go out anytime you want. And of course,\r\n                            1:25:35\r\n                            all the money in the world is the free banking  system. All the money from everywhere goes there.\r\n                            1:25:41\r\n                            The program that I saw in the 60 minutes, there is  a beautiful park around the lake in the middle of  \r\n                            1:25:48\r\n                            Zurich and this park has become the center for  drug users and drug addicts. It was so so sad,\r\n                            1:26:00\r\n                            so tragic to see those. What they have done is that  young people in the ages of 15 to 30, very young  \r\n                            1:26:09\r\n                            they come to this park and using drugs in that  park, dealing it is free, although drug dealing  \r\n                            1:26:16\r\n                            and using in Switzerland is, is against the  law. But the government, according to CBS, has  \r\n                            1:26:23\r\n                            let this area to be an area for drug use and  drug dealing because they think with this\r\n                            1:26:31\r\n                            they're containing the problem in that one area.  And the documentary was saying that the number  \r\n                            1:26:38\r\n                            of these people in this place has risen in the  last years so so much. And then, what they do as  \r\n                            1:26:49\r\n                            third and advocating righteousness and, you  know, forbidding people from doing evil,\r\n                            1:26:54\r\n                            they distribute clean needles. The government sponsors  that because they wanna stop the spread of the  \r\n                            1:27:00\r\n                            AIDS among those. So, they are free to come and  get free needles to use it for injecting drugs  \r\n                            1:27:08\r\n                            in their body and they were interviewing some of  these young people who were 20, 18, 21  \r\n                            1:27:15\r\n                            years old and asking them, you know, \"what you live for?\" They said \"nothing. The only thing that I live  \r\n                            1:27:23\r\n                            for is my next injection, my next round of drug.\" And they asked one of these kids who was the  \r\n                            1:27:35\r\n                            son of one of the big shots in the government and  I think it was Mike Wallace asked him \"okay, what does  \r\n                            1:27:42\r\n                            your dad, you know, how does your dad does do this? You know, he has so much money.\" And he  \r\n                            1:27:48\r\n                            said \"doesn't he feel that, you know, these  empires with so much money can do anything about   this? Where is the morality?\" And he answered that  when he goes he is a moral man but when he goes  \r\n                            1:28:00\r\n                            to work, he leaves his morality at home because  business doesn't have anything to do with the   morality. That's business, so he has to do his job. But when he comes home, he's worried about what  \r\n                            1:28:10\r\n                            happens. But that was a very good example of what  is, what is really happening to the, the youngsters  \r\n                            1:28:19\r\n                            of this, this world and in the heart of a country, in a city that is known as one of the  \r\n                            1:28:28\r\n                            best places that, you know, the heaven of the rich, the heaven of the people and this was\r\n                            1:28:36\r\n                            an example of which I thought is... was very moving  and very ironic. So, I stop here and ask for any  \r\n                            1:28:48\r\n                            questions or comments.\r\n                            onsequence of losing the 5 daily prayers.\r\n                            1:29:01\r\n                            The messenger: I think I will open this... somebody asked about this. I open the discussion with verse 115 where it says\r\n                            1:29:10\r\n                            [3:115] Any good they do will not go unrewarded. GOD is fully aware of who the righteous are.\r\n                            1:29:17\r\n                            It's talking about the righteous Jews and Christians. As we learned from Sura 19, they lost their contact prayers, for example.  \r\n                            1:29:28\r\n                            They do not do the five prayers. Five prayers are very very very, infinite very important  \r\n                            1:29:36\r\n                            because they go a long way towards proving that  God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, is our god.\r\n                            1:29:42\r\n                            They remind us of God and, you know, benefits that we  just cannot overestimate, overemphasize.\r\n                            1:29:50\r\n                            So, the Jews and Christians do not have the 5 daily prayers. These righteous Jews and Christians described here, they recite\r\n                            1:30:01\r\n                            God's revelations through the night and they fall  prostrate, they advocate righteousness, they forbid  \r\n                            1:30:07\r\n                            evil and they hasten to do righteous works,  charitable works, and so on. And this is why God is\r\n                            1:30:14\r\n                            saying that these things will not go unrewarded. So, they'll be rewarded for this, but it is nothing  \r\n                            1:30:20\r\n                            compared to the specific steps of rites that God prescribes for us, the Prayers, the fasting of Ramadan.  \r\n                            1:30:29\r\n                            As you know, within our lifetime, the Christians,  for example, lost the fasting. First there was no  \r\n                            1:30:35\r\n                            meat on Friday and in Easter or, what is it, the Lent, they used to give up important things. Now, they give up\r\n                            1:30:46\r\n                            Macadamia nuts. So, they lost the fasting. They  lost the contact prayers. And these are the important  \r\n                            1:30:57\r\n                            things that cause our souls to grow and develop. So, I just... this is a very important verse 115.\r\n                            1:31:04\r\n                            The implication from the Arabic text, and  I hope this is reflected in the English,\r\n                            1:31:09\r\n                            is that these are all good things. They recite God's  revelations, they fall prostrate, they are righteous, they advocate\r\n                            1:31:15\r\n                            righteousness, they forbid evil, they have high  moral standards, they are truthful and honest, but  \r\n                            1:31:21\r\n                            all these things, all these things combined will  be a small fraction of what we get from the five  \r\n                            1:31:29\r\n                            daily prayers, for example. The five daily prayers are so important that... Shakira: Are they the most important of all the prayers? The messenger: Definitely.\r\n                            1:31:39\r\n                            Shakira: So, if...\r\n                            \r\n                            \r\n                            04 Quran Study From Azhar 4 Sura 37 By Rashad Shakira Present Astroid 01 21 1990 Sura 3;118 129 By S\r\n                            \r\n                            Shakira: My God, you guys eat too many sweets. Can't you think about your cholesterol? The messenger: Whose fault is it? Who got these? Shakira: But that is one. The messenger: Whose fault is this? You need sweets.\r\n                            0:21\r\n                            Shakira: I am sweet enough to eat sweet. The messenger: But you said you need sweets for you.\r\n                            0:26\r\n                            (unintelligible). The messenger: Haven't you seen this before? Documented proof. I cannot believe he's a liar. Shakira: I know. Can you believe this? Where did they take the\r\n                            0:41\r\n                            picture? The messenger: God knows. Shakira: They have to be in front of something. Ismail Barakat: The scale of the lies. A woman: I can't believe it.\r\n                            0:49\r\n                            The messenger: I know. Did you read the details? Shakira: Yeah. The messenger: I have the English translation. They say they went to Rashad Khalifa's mosque and\r\n                            1:00\r\n                            investigated him. Ismail Barakat: And they found that he's a good liar. The messenger: Established once and for all that he's a liar. And here's proof.\r\n                            1:08\r\n                            I have a picture in front of his mosque.\r\n                            1:15\r\n                            The messenger: أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ 448\r\n                            1:23\r\n                            Oh, I love this. This is my favorite. Let's go to 447. What the heck? Let's starts from the beginning of the Sura.\r\n                            1:33\r\n                            This is my favorite part. The people of Heaven visit their relatives and friends.\r\n                            1:41\r\n                            It's true. Every one of us has some relatives and friends who'll derail. We're gonna go visit them. Shakira: We won't feel sad?\r\n                            1:48\r\n                            The messenger: No. Because, did you know... oh, you missed the ways people go to hell. You wanna survey?\r\n                            1:57\r\n                            Yeah, Shakira? It's Mahmood's specialty, he surveys the methods of going to hell. Go ahead, number one.\r\n                            2:05\r\n                            Mahmood: Number one: They duck under the fence. The messenger: This is number one. Number 2? Shakira: I don't understand.\r\n                            2:12\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: No, no, no, number one is the storming of the gates. The messenger: The storming of the gates? Ok. The storming the gates of hell. You know, they...\r\n                            2:21\r\n                            The messenger: A group of people are carrying a big log and there's the gates of hell. And They are storming the gates to go in. Shakira: And these are the disbelievers? The messenger: Yes.\r\n                            2:29\r\n                            (unintelligible). The messenger: They are insisting on going in. So, this is number\r\n                            2:34\r\n                            one, storming the gates. Number two is tunneling their way under the fence. Shakira: Is it in the text? The messenger: Number 3...\r\n                            2:40\r\n                            The messenger: Almost. We'll get to that later, but listen to this first. This is what we realize on the\r\n                            2:47\r\n                            Day of Judgment. This is why you will not be sad. Shakira: Storming the gates and then tunneling under it. The messenger: Wait, wait. This is to answer your question \"are we gonna feel sad for the\r\n                            2:55\r\n                            people in hell?\" This is your question. Here is the answer. We're going to find out on the Day of Judgment, this is how they got to hell. Some of them stormed the gates.\r\n                            3:04\r\n                            Number two, some of them tunnel their way under the fence. Ismail Barakat: They tackle the 19 angels who guard hell and try to beat them. The messenger: Number three, listen.\r\n                            3:13\r\n                            A man: They pole vault? The messenger: Pole vaulters. Shakira: Ok. What? The messenger: Pole vaulters. Shakira: Oh, Pole vaulters.\r\n                            3:21\r\n                            The messenger: And, you know, they jump over it. \"Oh, I barely made it.\" And as soon as they fall down, they raise their arms. \"Made it.\"\r\n                            3:33\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: Because Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala built solid walls around hell to keep people from getting in. And they get\r\n                            3:40\r\n                            in by fighting their way in. This is what they are saying. The messenger: Exactly. A woman: And the final wall was 19.\r\n                            3:46\r\n                            The messenger: Yes, 19 walls, 19 fences. Shakira: So, now tell me pole valuting, tunneling and barging?\r\n                            3:54\r\n                            A man: Next one is one big, huge one. (unintelligible). The messenger: Seesaw in a circus. Shakira: Ok. Seesawing it. The messenger: No, wait. No, no, we didn't. (unintelligible).\r\n                            4:06\r\n                            The messenger: Coming up. You know, the circus, we jump on this and they go up, way up. Somersault.\r\n                            4:12\r\n                            The messenger: Somersault their way \"hey, I made three somersaults.\" A man: The problem is who will take the big one, now?\r\n                            4:19\r\n                            The messenger: The next one, number five. Ismail Barakat: No, no, the big one, you see, they open the gates and let him in.\r\n                            4:27\r\n                            Shakira: Because there are seven gates. The messenger: Yes, number five, there are seven gates. A man: They all go in cannon.\r\n                            4:34\r\n                            The messenger: The cannonball, human cannonball. A man: And they fire it. Shakira: Now, where did you get all this from? A man: Sura 115. The messenger: Sura 115.\r\n                            4:49\r\n                            Shakira: If your imagination is not...\r\n                            4:56\r\n                            The messenger: Even if gets very scary. Shakira: No, but in the Quran, it says that the people will try to come towards Heaven. And then they can't, they won't be able to stand it and they'll go back.\r\n                            5:05\r\n                            They'll keep going back, they'll try to go and come back and try to go and come back. And here they're pole vaulting. The messenger: Yes, no, we're talking, but now they are doing this, see. Now they're\r\n                            5:14\r\n                            like for example, how do you explain, the guy, we tell him \"Sura Qãf has 57 Qafs.\" He says \"no, the word فَحَقَّ, because there is a Shadda on it, it's two Qafs. It's FAHAQAQA.\r\n                            5:25\r\n                            It's not 57, it's 58, there is no miracle there.\" How do you stop this guy? Now this guy is trying a cannon. Ismail Barakat: No, no, no, God doesn't want them to go to hell. God wants all to go to paradise.\r\n                            5:37\r\n                            The messenger: In fact, Sura 39 says, God does not like it. Shakira: They insist on going to hell, that's what it says. They insist. The messenger: There you go, that's the answer to your question.\r\n                            5:43\r\n                            The messenger: So, we will not be sad because we will realize that they tried all these methods to force themselves into hell. I usually, I used, they jumped the fence. This is the\r\n                            5:54\r\n                            only thing I used, because this is what I used to do. When there was a soccer ball in my hometown, and they are fighting for the final championship, and they have, at the club,\r\n                            6:04\r\n                            the soccer balls, the two champion teams coming to my hometown. And they have police on horses\r\n                            6:10\r\n                            patrolling the fence out there. I was there, an expert in jumping fences. That was a\r\n                            6:15\r\n                            high fence, like 7 feet, with the things pointing and the head like that. So, I waited until two\r\n                            6:21\r\n                            horses were facing the other way, and then.... And I'm in the club to watch the game.\r\n                            6:27\r\n                            Must have been 7 years old. Shakira: You know, in India, they have walls with a glass on top of it.\r\n                            6:33\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: Right, they have the same thing in Egypt. It doesn't stop them, though. Shakira: I used to climb over it and go and steal grapes. And one day, the guy came behind me. You know, my grandfather,\r\n                            6:45\r\n                            he's the dean of Osmania University, my grandfather. And I used to do these terrible things.\r\n                            6:50\r\n                            My sister and I, we jumped it, and we went into the grape garden, and we stole the grapes,\r\n                            6:56\r\n                            and we jumped back. The man came behind us with a stick. The messenger: You never forget that. Shakira: He came behind us with a stick\r\n                            7:02\r\n                            and my uncle, you know, the Nizam of Hyderabad. He is the architect for the Nizam of Hyderabad.\r\n                            7:09\r\n                            And they were constructing this big thing for the Nizam, my uncle. And he took us there, and this is what we were doing. He was so ashamed of us that he just said \"these people don't\r\n                            7:21\r\n                            belong to me.\" The messenger: \"I don't know them. I never saw them in my life, these grape thieves.\"\r\n                            7:26\r\n                            Shakira: We were little kids. \"I don't know these people. Who are these people? I don't...\"\r\n                            7:32\r\n                            Shakira: Oh, my God. The messenger: So, I used to jump the fence to get into the soccer game. And these people in hell, we will realize\r\n                            7:38\r\n                            that they insisted. They jumped so many fences to go to. hell. Shakira: Yeah, they insist on going to hell. Ismail Barakat: But you see, what you did,\r\n                            7:45\r\n                            you waited until the guards weren't looking. These guys are gonna attack the guards. The messenger: Yes. Exactly.\r\n                            7:51\r\n                            The messenger: In fact, they said that if \"19 of the guards of hell, leave them to me, some big guy.\"\r\n                            7:57\r\n                            Shakira: So your imagination, he used his imagination to do five things? The messenger: Yes. Behrouz: No, he has 19.\r\n                            8:04\r\n                            The messenger: We are thinking of the ways and means that they are forcing themselves. Shakira: Yeah, some of them can\r\n                            8:11\r\n                            go in a tank. The messenger: How about balloons? Shakira: You don't have a tank? Hot air balloons.\r\n                            8:20\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: Balloons are not very good, because you see hot air rises. The messenger: He's talking about the kite. A man: Oh, yeah, they were not balloons\r\n                            8:27\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: It keeps going up. The messenger: But he will let go. He'll jump from it or something. The messenger: Yeah, the kite. He's talking about the kite. A man: The kite, no, that's the hang glider.\r\n                            8:38\r\n                            The messenger: Isn't it a kite also, same name? Ismail Barakat: Yeah, this is an excellent subject for Mad Magazine.\r\n                            8:46\r\n                            A man: Hang glider, yes. And they can use trampoline. The messenger: There's a profound word coming up here that also adds to jumping\r\n                            8:57\r\n                            the fence. Something that's happened to Ismail. It gives an example of the disbeliever jumping\r\n                            9:02\r\n                            the fence into hell. Because the second verse here uses the word فَٱلزَّٰجِرَٰتِ زَجْرًۭا (37:2) which I translated here as \"the blamers.\" Some guy came to Ismail and said \"what is ٱلزَّٰجِرَٰتِ?\r\n                            9:12\r\n                            You know, he leaves all the straightforward verses in Quran \"can you tell me? If you are so clever, you and Rashad and your people, \"what ٱلزَّٰجِرَٰتِ is?\"\r\n                            9:21\r\n                            Ismail said \"goats. Will this satisfy you now? Okay, now what?\" It's a strange word. You see, زَجْرًۭا means to blame.\r\n                            9:33\r\n                            ٱلزَّٰجِرَٰتِ , the blamers. But he picks out this strange word and says \"okay, if you are so clever,\r\n                            9:39\r\n                            tell me, what does it mean, ٱلزَّٰجِرَٰتِ?\" He said \"goats.\" Ismail Barakat: If he knows the meaning of ٱلزَّٰجِرَٰتِ,\r\n                            9:46\r\n                            he'd be a good believer. The messenger: Yes. \"Now here's the meaning, okay, now what?\"\r\n                            9:53\r\n                            أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. [37:1] By the arrangers in columns. [37:2] And the blamers of those to be blamed.\r\n                            10:04\r\n                            Now, we're talking about angels here. Because we have in another verse, in another Sura,\r\n                            10:10\r\n                            the angels say \"we are the arrangers.\" Actually, it is in this Sura, excuse me. It's coming later. Yeah.\r\n                            10:16\r\n                            \"We are the arrangers.\" So, apparently the angels will play a role in the resurrection process and arranging all the people. Shakira: That's gonna take a long time. The messenger: Who cares?\r\n                            10:27\r\n                            We have infinity. She's thinking in appointments, you know, \"how many patients, today?\"\r\n                            10:35\r\n                            Shakira: If they make me comfortable, that's okay. IN SHAA ALLAH. The messenger: Right. And the blamers of those to be blamed, because\r\n                            10:41\r\n                            the angels, remember, they're gonna beat up the disbelievers. They'll blame them, you know. \"We served you. God gave you so many chances and you still disbelieved. You're unappreciative.\"\r\n                            10:51\r\n                            Smack, smack. What is hitting? Smack is a kiss. A woman: No, Smack is also a hit. The messenger: So, also a hit. Okay. Smack, smack, kick, kick.\r\n                            11:01\r\n                            Shakira: But these are blaming each other, right? And the blamers of those to be blamed. The messenger: No, no, no. They blame the disbelievers. Shakira: Yeah, they're blaming each other.\r\n                            11:09\r\n                            The messenger: The angels are blaming the disbelievers. The arrangers and the blamers are angels. Also the reciters of the messages.\r\n                            11:16\r\n                            Shakira: Mã Shã Allãh. That's why we have you. We have you with us, I mean. The messenger: Angels. These are all... The messenger: These are all angels, the arrangers, the blamers, the reciters.\r\n                            11:25\r\n                            So God is stating these profound facts, three of them, and then God says the result of, the result:\r\n                            11:32\r\n                            [37:4] Your god is only one. [37:5] The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and everything between them, and Lord of the easts.*\r\n                            11:40\r\n                            I'm having a heck of a time, Ismail, translating (37:5) ٱلْمَشَـٰرِقِ easts. Because what it really means is the Sun rise, the Jupiter rise, the Saturn rise,\r\n                            11:49\r\n                            the Mars rise. Ismail Barakat: Ah, I see, I see. The messenger: These are the easts. It's not east, it's the rises.\r\n                            11:55\r\n                            But how do you translate it to English so the people understand? Ismail Barakat: There is a technical term, I think. A woman: Rising term? Ismail Barakat: Yes. There is an astronomical term.\r\n                            12:07\r\n                            The messenger: I'm making this known to everybody so they come up with a good word. As soon as you wake up, Lydia, think about this.\r\n                            12:21\r\n                            If you talk about the sun and the moon, yes. If you talk about the sun and the moon.\r\n                            12:30\r\n                            The messenger: Oh, you go to the airport? You're going now? Ok. Good luck to you.\r\n                            12:37\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: Salãmun ‘Alaykum A man: Wa ‘Alaykum Salãm Shakira: KHODA HAFEZ. Who is she? The messenger: This is my sister. She's going now to take her medical exam. ECFMG.\r\n                            12:46\r\n                            The messenger: ECFMG. Shakira: I didn't see her yesterday. The messenger: Yes, she was here. She's very... she hides. She's very shy. I mean,\r\n                            12:55\r\n                            I should have brought her to you. Shakira: Well, I'm sure she'll do a good job. Is she giving her ECFMG? The messenger: IN SHAA ALLAH. Yes.\r\n                            13:03\r\n                            Shakira: What is it now? It's January? Yeah, they have it in January. The messenger: Yeah, it's January 20th. Yeah, tomorrow. Shakira: Yeah, this is the day.\r\n                            13:11\r\n                            The messenger: No, 23rd, Tuesday. Yeah. Shakira: Mã Shã Allãh. She's a monk. The messenger: Yeah, your god is only One.\r\n                            13:23\r\n                            The messenger: So now, the Lord of the East, you know what it means now. One time, I was in Washington, D.C.,\r\n                            13:32\r\n                            and the question of Ramadan came up. So, I reached for the newspaper, the Washington Post,\r\n                            13:42\r\n                            to show the person that the new moon, he could see the new moon in the paper, and\r\n                            13:48\r\n                            it will tell you when the new month is. You don't need to go out and look through the clouds for the moon, which is very thin, it's impossible to see with binoculars and all this. Especially\r\n                            13:58\r\n                            if you're blind like Ben Bez and try to decide when the, you know. So, you know what\r\n                            One of the followers announces they are colour blind.\r\n                            14:03\r\n                            I found in the Washington Post? You can pick it up at any drug store. They have the moon...\r\n                            14:09\r\n                            ...all solar system. Ismail Barakat: Yeah, and in the paper, in Vancouver Sun. The messenger: Yeah, but I was really amazed.\r\n                            14:18\r\n                            The messenger: Yes, yes, we have the sun and the moon here. Yes. But at the Washington Post and probably the New\r\n                            14:25\r\n                            York Times, the major newspapers, I know the Washington Post does it every day. I mean,\r\n                            14:31\r\n                            if you wanna see what time Saturn rises, and the new Saturn, it's just a...\r\n                            14:40\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: They don't even know what Saturn looks like. The messenger: Which one has the rings? Saturn has the rings on it.\r\n                            14:46\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: You can't see it with the naked eye. You need telescope. A man: Mars is red, you can see it.\r\n                            14:52\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: Yeah, but I'm color blind. To me they're all alike. A man: And also the time they rise is different.\r\n                            15:00\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: Yeah, of course. The messenger: Those people are so behind, you know. Behrouz: But this is all according to our sun.\r\n                            15:08\r\n                            The messenger: Yes. Yes. The earth. Because we are sitting in a place that's half light and half dark.\r\n                            15:13\r\n                            So, we have the rises, and we're rotating. So, we have the rises of all these planets.\r\n                            15:20\r\n                            As far as anything in the heaven is concerned, there's rise and set because of our rotation.\r\n                            15:28\r\n                            Behrouz: Yeah, because there's no one else. The messenger: Why do I do rotation like this? Actually, it's like this.\r\n                            15:36\r\n                            It doesn't matter, we may be upside down. Let's say we're sitting upside down right now.\r\n                            15:41\r\n                            Behrouz: But there's another time... The messenger: This (unintelligible) doesn't fall off. Ismail Barakat: It never does.\r\n                            15:47\r\n                            A woman: I didn't understand when I was little, you know, we talked about everything around us. I was wondering how\r\n                            15:52\r\n                            come nothing fell. I didn't understand gravity. I was very little. The messenger: Gravity. The messenger: The way to understand it is to imagine an ant walking in this globe. An ant is walking around, it's cool,\r\n                            16:02\r\n                            in this globe. A woman: Yeah, I understand it now. A man: Upside down. A woman: No, I was a little kid. I understand it.\r\n                            16:09\r\n                            The messenger: So, this is the way we are. A woman: Yeah, but it's wonderful. But I was little and I was fascinated by it.\r\n                            16:15\r\n                            The messenger: Sorry, Behrouz, I interrupted you. Behrouz: So, one time you talked about the two Easts and two Wests.\r\n                            16:22\r\n                            The messenger: Right. That's the sun and the moon. Yeah, sun and the moon. Two major things.\r\n                            16:27\r\n                            Behrouz: Two majors for the humans and jinns. The messenger: Right. Ismail Barakat: What's that again? Behrouz: I like that one better.\r\n                            16:33\r\n                            The messenger: Or the sunrise for the humans and the jinns. Ismail Barakat: So, it's the same thing.\r\n                            16:39\r\n                            The messenger: Yeah, but you see... Behrouz: For jinns must be, I mean, might be something different.\r\n                            16:45\r\n                            The messenger: Well, the jinns on earth, they will have the sunrise and the sunset. Ismail Barakat: The same thing as ours. The messenger: No, but God wanted to make a point that there\r\n                            16:50\r\n                            are two sets of creatures on earth. Sura Al-Rahmaan, for example, is directed to the two, two, I mean, ٱلثَّقَلَین, these are called, ٱلثَّقَلَین, the humans and the jinns. So, God is talking to them separately because they have\r\n                            17:03\r\n                            separate needs. For example, a jinn will not care about steak, but you would. And you\r\n                            17:10\r\n                            do not care about a box of matches for dinner. But they like it, maybe to them. I mean, I don't know\r\n                            17:17\r\n                            what they like for dinner. So, if God describes heaven to them as fruits and rivers of milk\r\n                            17:24\r\n                            and honey and they don't care about these things, they say \"oh, we don't want to go there.\" So, that... what was that? A man: Fatiha on Tuesday. Don't forget that. A man: Fatiha on Tuesday.\r\n                            17:33\r\n                            The messenger: Soad again? Oh, boy, she's nervous about the test. She'll call us from the airport.\r\n                            17:41\r\n                            The messenger: Don't forget, Fatiha on Tuesday. Ismail Barakat: But the Qur'an, I think, is directed to us, not to them.\r\n                            17:49\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: Essentially, it's directed to us. The messenger: No, no, to us and the jinns. قُلْ أُوحِىَ إِلَىَّ أَنَّهُ ٱسْتَمَعَ نَفَرٌۭ مِّنَ ٱلْجِنِّ فَقَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّا سَمِعْنَا قُرْءَانًا عَجَبًۭا (72:1)\r\n                            Quran is for the humans and the Jinns.\r\n                            18:00\r\n                            وَإِذْ صَرَفْنَآ إِلَيْكَ نَفَرًۭا مِّنَ ٱلْجِنِّ (46:29) We'll send the jinns to you to listen to the Quran. It's to them, also.\r\n                            18:06\r\n                            فَلَمَّا قُضِىَ وَلَّوْا۟ إِلَىٰ قَوْمِهِم مُّنذِرِينَ (46:29) So, they went to their people. They are jinns, also.\r\n                            18:16\r\n                            All the jinns in the world now know about this message and the miracle of 19.\r\n                            18:24\r\n                            Shakira: So, what does it mean when it says \"Lord of the two easts and two wests?\"\r\n                            18:30\r\n                            The messenger: Again, it's the sunrise and moonrise, sunset, and moonset. Ismail Barakat: Or according to Behrouz... The messenger: Ismail, do you ever think of that term, that astronomical term?\r\n                            18:41\r\n                            The messenger: Maybe, you can call the astronomy department again and see what this means. How can you express it in an English word? Ismail Barakat: There's one word that says exactly that.\r\n                            18:49\r\n                            The messenger: Yes. We have the best astronomy department here, one of the best in the world. Yes.\r\n                            18:56\r\n                            OK, since you're familiar with them by now. Keep calling them.\r\n                            19:01\r\n                            Ask them \"how can you express in one English word the rise of Saturn and Jupiter and Mars and Venus and the moon?\"\r\n                            19:09\r\n                            Shakira: Can't you say rise of the planets? The messenger: Yes, that will explain it. Ismail Barakat: The planet rising, so we say sunrise, moonrise, sunset, moonset. The messenger: Yes, the rise of the planets is a good expression.\r\n                            19:19\r\n                            We're getting there. Except it's not just the planets, stars. Ismail Barakat: Actually, probably, Rashad, the best way to express it is the (unintelligible), I think, the rise of the planets.\r\n                            19:30\r\n                            The messenger: The rise of the stars and the planets. The rise of the heavenly bodies. Ismail Barakat: Yeah, if you use the technical term, people... it will distract people.\r\n                            19:37\r\n                            Shakira: But they won't know. Heavenly bodies will confuse them. The messenger: Yeah. Well, let's see what they come up with. It may turn into a\r\n                            19:45\r\n                            beautiful word, very expressive. Yes, that's a good idea, also. But anyway, this is what\r\n                            19:51\r\n                            easts means in number 5. Number 6, [37:6] We have adorned the lowest heaven with beautiful stars.\r\n                            19:57\r\n                            Those billion, trillion stars are in the lowest, innermost, and smallest of the seven universes. And number 7, [37:7] and guarded it from every evil devil.\r\n                            Our universe is the prison cell for the devil and his Angels\r\n                            20:09\r\n                            This is the prison cell for Satan and all his angels, the devils. Satan and his angels. It's a good expression.\r\n                            20:18\r\n                            Shakira: What do you mean, Satan and his angels? The messenger: Because Satan is a temporary god here, and the devils are his angels.\r\n                            20:25\r\n                            They help him, they work for him. Shakira: But we shouldn't call them angels. The messenger: Well, Satan's angels. Yes, you can use this expression. For example, God calls the believers, the believers say\r\n                            20:37\r\n                            کفرنا بِشِرْكِكُمْ We are KAFIRs of their idolatry. But the word KAFIR\r\n                            20:43\r\n                            is generally used for a disbeliever, a pagan. So you can use that. Actually, it's a very\r\n                            20:48\r\n                            expressive term. Shakira: Yeah, it is very expressive, but it is confusing if somebody doesn't already know a lot about the Quran.\r\n                            20:56\r\n                            The messenger: Well, but when you say \"Satan's angels\", it's understandable. Once you say Satan's angels. Actually, it paints a picture of a god with a small \"g\" and his assistants.\r\n                            21:10\r\n                            Shakira: Hell's angels. The messenger: Motorcycle gangs. Okay, number 7, [37:7] guarded it from every evil devil. [37:8] They cannot spy on the High Society; they get shot from every side.\r\n                            21:22\r\n                            [37:9] They are doomed; they have incurred an eternal retribution. [37:10] If any of them ventures to charge the outer limits, he gets struck with a fierce projectile.\r\n                            21:32\r\n                            [37:11] Ask them, \"Are they more difficult to create, or our other creations?\" We created them from wet mud.\r\n                            21:40\r\n                            Of course, it is from the evolution point of view, wet mud is significant because it's water.\r\n                            21:46\r\n                            Shakira: You know, Reshma told me that. Because God keeps repeating that He created us, life came from water and then He says He made us from clay. The messenger: Mã Shã Allãh.\r\n                            21:53\r\n                            Shakira: So, I said \"my God, you know\" and Reshma said \"mummy, how simple it is. He just took clay and he mixed it with water and He made you.\" He told me that. The messenger: Yes.\r\n                            22:05\r\n                            The messenger: Good thinking. Evolution is a divinely guided process. Number 12. [37:12] While you are awed, they mock.\r\n                            22:14\r\n                            The messenger: How true this is. Shakira: Yeah. The messenger: Cause we are awed of what God created, and they mock and ridicule. Shakira: Yeah, worried for our necks. The messenger: Yeap.\r\n                            22:23\r\n                            [37:13] When reminded, they take no heed. [37:14] When they see proof, they ridicule it. [37:15] They say, \"This is obviously magic! [37:16] \"After we die and become dust and bones, do we get resurrected?\r\n                            22:36\r\n                            Now, this is number 16. I always emphasize. Because if you take the total picture of the Quran, this is not what they utter audibly.\r\n                            22:44\r\n                            It's something in their mind, inside their heart. Even they are not aware of it. Shakira: I used to think like this, too. Even though, you know, I'm a Muhammadan. I used to be a Muhammadan. I used\r\n                            22:56\r\n                            to think exactly \"how am I going to be reborn?\" And it's not, you know. The messenger: Well, it's a natural question for a growing person. And that's why God gives us 40 years to think about it\r\n                            23:07\r\n                            to ask these questions. 17. Yes? Behrouz: Red mud. Mud is, you know, when you think about mud, you know\r\n                            23:19\r\n                            it's red. Hard and heavy. Using the same mud. The messenger: (37:11) طِينٍۢ لَّازِبٍۭ The messenger: It means a lot of water. Mud that has a lot of water in it. طِينٍۢ لَّازِبٍۭ\r\n                            23:35\r\n                            The messenger: Ok. Let's take, you have clay, you hold the clay in your hand. If you add water to it, what happens?\r\n                            23:42\r\n                            Behrouz: It becomes mud. The messenger: It is mud already. It is mud already. If you hold it in your hand, you add more water, what happens?\r\n                            23:51\r\n                            Shakira: It becomes some wet mud. He wants you to say that. The messenger: No, it becomes softer. You can't even hold it in your hand. Ismail Barakat: More malleable so you can mold it.\r\n                            23:58\r\n                            The messenger: That is the description here. طِينٍۢ لَّازِبٍۭ here means you cannot hold it in your hand. You can put it in a glass. Very soft. Wet mud. Where are we, 17?\r\n                            24:16\r\n                            [37:17] \"Even our ancient ancestors?\" [37:18] Say, \"Yes, you will be forcibly summoned.\" [37:19] All it takes is one nudge, whereupon they (stand up) looking.\r\n                            24:28\r\n                            [37:20] They will say, \"Woe to us; this is the Day of Judgment.\" \"Oops\" is gonna be a very popular word. To be nice about it.\r\n                            24:40\r\n                            Shakira: Like that.\r\n                            24:47\r\n                            The messenger: Don't show him your hand. Because Mahmood will show you \"Like this.\"\r\n                            24:54\r\n                            Shakira: Like this. The messenger: Ouch.\r\n                            25:01\r\n                            21. 21.\r\n                            25:06\r\n                            [37:21] This is the day of decision that you used to disbelieve in. [37:22] Summon the transgressors, and their spouses, and the idols they worshiped [37:23] beside GOD, and guide them to the path of Hell.\r\n                            25:18\r\n                            Don't worry about spouses. It's rarely that two spouses make it. It's very rare. It's rare that we have two people in the same town make it. Let alone...\r\n                            25:32\r\n                            [37:22] Summon the transgressors, and their spouses, and the idols they worshiped [37:23] beside GOD, and guide them to the path of Hell. [37:24] Stop them, and ask them:\r\n                            25:41\r\n                            25 [37:25] \"Why do you not help one another?\" What happened to you? [37:26] They will be, on that day, totally submitting.\r\n                            25:50\r\n                            No more temporary godhood to anybody. Cause the test is over.\r\n                            25:57\r\n                            Mutual Blaming, 27. [37:27] They will blame one another, The messenger: Yes. Sure. Shakira: They cannot spy on the High Society means guarded above the lowest universe.\r\n                            Explains verses 37:8 they cannot spy on the high society.\r\n                            26:09\r\n                            The messenger: Right. Beyond the first universe where there are major decisions being made. For example,\r\n                            26:15\r\n                            For example, one angel is charged with sending an asteroid to hit Saudi Arabia. Ok. And that angel is coming on the way and they're talking to each other. The jinns, if they have access to that area, they will hear it.\r\n                            26:30\r\n                            And they'll come and do something about it. Shakira: You say like that, but then in the Quran, it says the jinns are so dumb sometimes. Because remember\r\n                            26:38\r\n                            when Solomon died, they couldn't even make out that he was dead for a while. The messenger: But when he fell down, they knew, right? Shakira: Then they knew. The messenger: Right. So, well, yeah. Obviously, one angel is telling the other one, he is going a million times the speed of light, telling his friend \"where are you going? You want to send an asteroid to Saudi Arabia?\"\r\n                            26:54\r\n                            Everybody will hear that. Everybody in the vicinity. Ismail Barakat: Oh, no, they may be communicating mentally. And these guys can... The messenger: Mentally, exactly. Yeah, I'm just putting it in our terms. They can intercept communication.\r\n                            27:11\r\n                            Shakira: You tell this to the people, they think we are crazy. The messenger: Yes, they just can't comprehend.\r\n                            27:18\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: They don't believe, look, let me tell you something. Most people, most people don't really believe that they are going to die.\r\n                            27:24\r\n                            Shakira: No, no, they know they are going to die. The messenger: You're quoting the Quran. Shakira: They believe they are not going to die. Ismail Barakat: In their heart. The messenger: Yes\r\n                            27:31\r\n                            (Unintelligible). Ismail Barakat: If it crosses their hearts, if it crosses their minds, that they are going to kick the bucket. The messenger: Not me. Yeah.\r\n                            27:37\r\n                            A woman: (Unintelligible). The messenger: Right.\r\n                            27:43\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: It happens all around them and they forget it very quickly. The messenger: Yes. The messenger: It's always somebody else. Ismail Barakat: So, when you tell them they're coming back, The messenger: \"Forget it.\"\r\n                            27:56\r\n                            You know, it amazed me when we calculated the end of the world. It amazed me how many people were really upset.\r\n                            Question asked “why did God create our Souls.”\r\n                            28:03\r\n                            I never forget the Mufti of Syria, you know, he was announcing Algeria in the conference, and this guy was pounding, I'm sure he broke a few bones in his hand. He was pounding on the thing and said\r\n                            28:13\r\n                            لَا تَأْتِيكُمْ إِلَّا بَغْتَةًۭ (7:187) It comes to you suddenly. It comes to you suddenly. Ismail Barakat: Yeah, it comes to him suddenly, yeah. For him, it's going to come suddenly. The messenger: I told him that.\r\n                            28:21\r\n                            The messenger: I said \"for you it will.\" Ismail Barakat: All of a sudden. The messenger: Thirteen times in the conference, only for the disbelievers it will come suddenly. Because he was quoting this expression in the Quran.\r\n                            28:29\r\n                            And consistent in the Quran \"only the disbelievers, it comes to them suddenly.\" And that guy went through fits, you know.\r\n                            28:36\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: Yeah. Because really they don't believe in it. The messenger: Some kind of active epilepsy. Shakira: Why did He create us? I don't understand. Why He created us?\r\n                            28:44\r\n                            Behrouz: Why did He what? Shakira: Why did He create us in the first place? I mean, just even a soul, why?\r\n                            28:50\r\n                            The messenger: God? Shakira: Yes. Why? The messenger: Are you related to Edip? No. Why? We will know why.\r\n                            29:00\r\n                            Shakira: Maybe because He turned to the vast, lightless universe and said \"be.\" Why?\r\n                            29:06\r\n                            The messenger: Well, I have to quote God's quotes from the Quran \"you don't ask Him why.\"\r\n                            29:11\r\n                            The messenger: (21:23) لَا يُسْـَٔلُ عَمَّا يَفْعَلُ \"Why You did that\" The messenger: For the sake of knowing. Ismail Barakat: The creation of the universe is for this test.\r\n                            29:20\r\n                            The messenger: Yes, I know that. But, no, she meant even initially. Ismail Barakat: Initially? The messenger: Yes. Shakira: This is already too far gone. Ismail Barakat: You know the answer. The answer I always give, Shakira \"on the Day of Judgment, ask.\" Shakira: I will, IN SHAA ALLAH.\r\n                            29:33\r\n                            The messenger: Well, of course, on the Day of Resurrection we'll know, we will know anyway. Everything will be known. The purpose.\r\n                            29:42\r\n                            The messenger: But even as far as this universe is concerned, no, He does say why. \"We did not create the heavens and the earth except for a specific purpose.\"\r\n                            29:50\r\n                            Shakira: And also not for us to play. Repeatedly, it says not to play. Not to play, but for hard work. He didn't create it for playing. The messenger: This purpose is stated in Sura 67. Yes. Right.\r\n                            30:00\r\n                            Shakira: It's for hard work. We have to work hard. The human being has to work hard.\r\n                            30:07\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: Is that what is meant? No, I think... Shakira: No, the word \"hard work\" is used. The messenger: (90:4) لَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ فِى كَبَدٍ\r\n                            30:13\r\n                            The messenger: For example, why are you awake now, Ismail? Why are you awake now? Why are you awake now? Ismail Barakat: Because I'm here. If I've been elsewhere, I've been fast asleep.\r\n                            30:22\r\n                            The messenger: No, you still wake up for Fajr. Ismail Barakat: I think what Shakira is saying, Rashad, is that Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala, I don't know where, the quote, but He says that He did not create this universe...\r\n                            30:37\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: He says that life on earth is nothing but fun, games and it's not to be taken seriously.\r\n                            30:45\r\n                            Shakira: I don't understand what you're saying. The messenger: You're not supposed to play. (90:4) لَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ فِى كَبَدٍ In other words,... Yes. And this is why, this is why you are up now. Shakira: I'm sure we know, understand it exactly like that. And possibly we understand the same thing.\r\n                            30:59\r\n                            Shakira: We are working hard right now. We are working hard right now. The messenger: Yes.\r\n                            Rising for Fujr is difficult but should get easier. Discussion of Ramadan during summer months (Indication of Astronomical timing used).\r\n                            31:05\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: I'm not working. Shakira: We are having a good time, Mã Shã Allãh. But exactly, that's why. The messenger: No, but if you didn't come across this message, you'd be fast asleep at this moment, right now.\r\n                            31:15\r\n                            Shakira: So, according to God, this is work. The messenger: Most people out there... Here comes my favorite impersonation. They're all...\r\n                            31:21\r\n                            Shakira: He says in the Quran that it is very hard for you to get up in the morning and pray. I know that it is hard for you to get up and pray in the morning, but not so for the believers. He says you will get up if you're a believer. It will not be hard for you. So that's why you say like that, The messenger: Exactly.\r\n                            31:36\r\n                            Shakira: because you're a good believer and it's not hard for you to get up. It's no longer hard for you. It used to be, but it is not, Mã Shã Allãh. The messenger: It used to be. I had to beat him up.\r\n                            31:49\r\n                            Shakira: And He specifically says about the morning prayer. The messenger: You see, Ismail, especially Ismail, because he's a night owl. He goes to bed like two or three in the morning and in Vancouver the night is half an hour.\r\n                            31:59\r\n                            Shakira: But you know, I'm sure it's the same with everybody. But you know that sometimes I'm so afraid to miss one NAMAZ (Contact Prayer). I'm so afraid. The messenger: Yes. God bless you. Mã Shã Allãh.\r\n                            32:08\r\n                            Shakira: I just panic. I have to be up, otherwise I panic. The messenger: It gets easier and easier.\r\n                            32:15\r\n                            The messenger: You see, at first, it's difficult, then it becomes easier. But for Ismail, you missed what I said that the night in Vancouver is half an hour.\r\n                            32:21\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: Half hour. The messenger: You pray ISHA and then you shouldn't sleep. You stick around for 20 more minutes and you pray Fajr. Ismail Barakat: That's what I do.\r\n                            32:33\r\n                            A woman: The night is short. The messenger: In the summer. Shakira: You know when, when, you know, I was in Alaska in July, it never became...\r\n                            32:42\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: It's getting darker. A woman: I have a picture that I brought in to Rashad. They had a time-lapse photography of the sun just touching the horizon and going back up. But how do you get sunset, the night and sunrise in there? It's two seconds. Shakira: That picture is from Alaska.\r\n                            32:56\r\n                            when it just touches the horizon. The messenger: July 21st, June 21st. Shakira: I was in Vancouver in July. Ismail Barakat: It's not July? Shakira: Yeah.\r\n                            33:04\r\n                            The messenger: Oh my God, you should have met our people there. Shakira: But in July I was not a believer. The messenger: Oh, yes, yeah.\r\n                            33:11\r\n                            The messenger: Next time, next time, be sure to give Ismail your phone. Shakira: Yeah. We went to Alaska. We went up to the Arctic Pole, you know. We went up to Denali National Park and Fairbanks. The messenger: She's been aflame since then.\r\n                            33:23\r\n                            Shakira: It was so beautiful. Anchorage is so beautiful.\r\n                            33:28\r\n                            The messenger: So in Ramadan, we have just barely enough time to drink.\r\n                            33:34\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: You know, In fact, it's impossible for me anyway. It's impossible for me to eat two meals.\r\n                            33:40\r\n                            The messenger: Yes, I know. Even I ate one meal in Ramadan. Shakira: That is going to be (unintelligible) because I eat so little that if I don't eat it every day, it's hard for me.\r\n                            33:51\r\n                            The messenger: You'd better make it easy. You'll be a bit surprised. Ismail Barakat: Just like getting up for Fajr. It's the same thing.\r\n                            33:58\r\n                            The messenger: The first three days are gonna be difficult but that's it. Shakira: I'm totally accepting that. Behrouz: Ziba was saying that she was listening to the talk show on radio and doctors were talking about this diet, like you start eating certain things.\r\n                            34:13\r\n                            They come to the conclusion that after 13 or 15 hours, your body does not get any food\r\n                            34:20\r\n                            anymore. It's like a chemical, the body provides like an antibiotic that cures the whole body. The messenger: Yes. Mã Shã Allãh.\r\n                            34:30\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: What does it do? It cures the whole body? Shakira: What did he say? The messenger: It cleanses the body. Like a hormone. Shakira: What did they find? The messenger: This doctor was speaking.\r\n                            34:41\r\n                            Behrouz: They found out after 14 hours, if you do not eat anything, the body provides something that cleans the whole body. The messenger: Like an antibody or the hormones\r\n                            34:53\r\n                            The messenger: It's like a Roto-Rooter and cholesterol. Behrouz: If you use it, it's good for you. The messenger: The body produces the Roto-Rooter to clean the veins. I believe it.\r\n                            35:10\r\n                            The messenger: Ramadan will be, it's getting shorter and shorter every day. It's gonna be March. This year, it will be March 27th.\r\n                            35:16\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: Now, Ramadan in Vancouver around Christmas time is fantastic.\r\n                            35:22\r\n                            The messenger: Yes, the day is half hour. A man: The day would be half hour.\r\n                            35:29\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: You know, all I used to do was, I don't usually eat a big lunch anyway, but I used to, all I did was miss my coffee in the morning and my coffee in the afternoon. That was the extent of it.\r\n                            35:41\r\n                            The messenger: These guys laugh at me all the time when I get in Vancouver because I'm all confused about the times. That's why I ask (intelligible). What I ask, he said \"we still have four hours left.\r\n                            35:52\r\n                            A woman: When I go up there in the summer, it's real strange. I normally go to bed early. I tend to go to bed and then wake up and pray the Night because I've already gone to bed before the Night.\r\n                            36:03\r\n                            I have to wake up and pray the Night and then go back to bed. Ismail Barakat: I used to do this a lot in summer. I'd go to bed and then wake up for ISHA and then stay up for Fajr and then go to bed. A woman: No, I wouldn't do that.\r\n                            36:19\r\n                            The messenger: It's a lot of fun anyway. Lydia visits DC every year. Shakira: Definitely, Ramadan is starting on 27th? The messenger: IN SHAA ALLAH, yes. Shakira: IN SHAA ALLAH.\r\n                            36:28\r\n                            Shakira: But why do they make such a big deal of the moon and this and that? I mean, every year there's a big hassle. There's a big hassle. I mean, they can never... The messenger: Because of Hadith. This is the whole idea. Isamil Barakat: Hadith.\r\n                            36:36\r\n                            The messenger: You can tell the Ramadan... Ismail Barakat: They screw up every year, every year. The messenger: Yes, they never pass... Shakira: Every year. Always, you know\r\n                            36:44\r\n                            Shakira: India has one Eid and Pakistan has another Eid. All the time. Every single time.\r\n                            36:50\r\n                            Shakira: They never had a shot of the same thing. Ismail Barakat: In Egypt now, I understand, Rashad, they use astronomical means. The messenger: No, they don't. They write it down. Astronomically, Ramadan will begin on March 27th. But the stupid Mufti has to tell them it's the 28th or the 26th. It's never the right day.\r\n                            37:07\r\n                            I mean, he seems to go out of his way to oppose the astronomical. Shakira: And Eid will be on 25? 26th. The messenger: 26th. Last day is 25. April 25.\r\n                            37:17\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: And you know, they come up with the dumbest obfuscation \"that it is impossible to determine when the moon appears.\" What are you talking about? Darn Americans put a guy at a certain spot within two feet of the spot\r\n                            37:30\r\n                            on the moon where it's supposed to be. And you guys can't even see it. Jesus Christ.\r\n                            37:37\r\n                            Shakira: Is it OK to say Jesus Christ? The messenger: No. Shakira: But I say it all the time. Jeez. I say Jeez all the time.\r\n                            37:47\r\n                            The messenger: Jeez, yes, maybe. I say it \"cheese\" so it's mine. Shakira: I can't say Jesus Christ? The messenger: No. Better to avoid it.\r\n                            37:58\r\n                            The messenger: Why? Shakira: Because you grew up with it. The messenger: I know, but I'm asking why you say Jesus Christ. It's a commemoration.\r\n                            38:07\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: But usually you say it in negative terms. The messenger: But Satan doesn't know that. Satan will point at you and says \"he's commemorating Jesus Christ.\" Because Jesus is dead. Really. Jesus will take the appearances.\r\n                            38:21\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: I stop this one. The messenger: Yes. Definitely. Ismail Barakat: God willing, it's the last time with Satan. The messenger: Yeah. You see, Satan hates you. You know that. And he will play dumb. Says \"Ismail Barakat is commemorating Jesus Christ.\"\r\n                            38:35\r\n                            The messenger: God will tell Satan \"you know what he means and I know what he means.\" \"I don't care.\" Satan. Crybaby. He's the biggest crybaby. Yes. The biggest crybaby.\r\n                            38:45\r\n                            And invariably God will grant him, because we give him the excuse. So, God grants him his excuse. He says \"It's OK. Go fix Ismail.\"\r\n                            38:56\r\n                            Shakira: I'll say something, but do you mean everybody has to, God has to forgive me. And then I think He was getting bored.\r\n                            39:03\r\n                            The messenger: Who? Shakira: God. Ismail Barakat: No, no, no The messenger: No. The people in Heaven, this way she said, God forgive me.\r\n                            39:10\r\n                            The messenger: Because even in Heaven the creatures will never be bored. This is... two things that would never happen in Heaven: being bored and being tired. Shakira: He didn't say \"bored.\"\r\n                            39:20\r\n                            Shakira: He said \"I will take away your worry. I will take away your jealousy. I will take away your tiredness.\" He didn't say \"I'll take away your bored.\" The messenger: Yes. Yes. Bored, yes.\r\n                            39:27\r\n                            Shakira: Bored? The messenger: He takes away being bored. You'll never be bored. Shakira: It says that in the Quran? Mã Shã Allãh. The messenger: Yes, in 14 or 15, I forget. Shakira: OK. Don't worry about it. So long as we can be happy. The messenger: Yes, take my word for it.\r\n                            39:39\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: But it'll be awfully boring, you know, because you've got a couple of trillion years. Shakira: I know.\r\n                            39:44\r\n                            Shakira: I keep thinking I'll do pelvic there. The messenger: Yep, anything you want. Shakira: Oh, my God. A man: Every day will be different.\r\n                            39:56\r\n                            The messenger: There are no days. One last day. Shakira: We'll be everlasting.\r\n                            40:05\r\n                            Shakira: We don't know whether it will be day or night or what. The messenger: One last day. Shakira: Will we sleep? I don't know.\r\n                            40:13\r\n                            The messenger: It'll be fun. Shakira: Everything is... The messenger: Mutual Blaming, 27. [37:27] They will blame one another. [37:28] They will say (to their leaders), \"You used to come to us from the right side.\"\r\n                            40:23\r\n                            Meaning pretending to be righteous. From the right side. 29.\r\n                            40:29\r\n                            [37:29] They will respond, \"It is you who were not believers. [37:30] \"We never had any power over you; it is you who were transgressors.\r\n                            40:36\r\n                            [37:31] \"We incurred our Lord's wrath; and now we have to suffer. [37:32] \"We misled you, only because we ourselves were misled.\"\r\n                            40:43\r\n                            [37:33] Thus, they will all suffer the retribution on that day together. [37:34] This is how we requite the guilty.\r\n                            40:49\r\n                            Now why are they in this bad position? Because of the following verses. [37:35] When they were told, \"Lã Elãha Ella Allãh [There is no other god beside GOD],\" they turned arrogant.\r\n                            41:00\r\n                            This is invariably the case. Tell them Lã Elãha Ella Allãh, they beat you up. In fact, I have it on video. Did you watch this video of Bilal Phillips? I have this video of Bilal Phillips. He says \"now Rashad Khalifa exposed himself. He says, Lã Elãha Ella Allãh, and that's it. Can you imagine that?\r\n                            41:21\r\n                            All he says is Lã Elãha Ella Allãh.\" Doesn't this guy think? Ismail Barakat: No, the thing is that the Hadith that he accepts says, if you say Lã Elãha Ella Allãh, you are guaranteed paradise. The messenger: Yes, even the Quran, even the Jews and the Christians, according to Quran, who say Lã Elãha Ella Allãh, they make it to heaven.\r\n                            41:35\r\n                            You know the theme of this Quran at the very beginning? If you believe in God,... Ismail Barakat: Sura 2:62. The messenger: Exactly.\r\n                            41:42\r\n                            So, even the Jews and the Christians obviously don't recognize Muhammad at all. Even the Jews who say Lã Elãha Ella Allãh, they go to heaven. And this guy, I have it here on the video. Anybody can see it. And he is saying \"Rashad Khalifa has gone completely bananas now. All he says is Lã Elãha Ella Allãh.\"\r\n                            41:58\r\n                            I mean, what is this? Ismail Barakat: Well, he says \"Lã Elãha Ella Allãh... Lã Elãha Ella Allãh, Muhammadan Rasoolu Allah.\" The messenger: Yes.\r\n                            42:06\r\n                            Shakira: You know I have such a habit for it that sometimes I automatically say and then I just (unintelligible). The messenger: It takes you a few months to get rid of it. Shakira: Yeah, that's true.\r\n                            42:14\r\n                            Shakira: SHAHADA, what does... SHAHADA mean \"witness?\" The messenger: Yes. Shakira: SHAHADA is witness. The word SHAHADA means witness. The messenger: Did Pari share with you her discovery?\r\n                            42:22\r\n                            Shakira: No, what? The messenger: That was a very significant discovery when she was here the last time. Shakira: Why? The messenger: She said, in the Quran, we witnessed God, Sura 7.\r\n                            42:34\r\n                            But we never witnessed any of the messengers. Shakira: Yes, of course we witnessed God\r\n                            42:39\r\n                            because it says very clearly. The messenger: Yes, and that's why God states the SHAHADA in the Quran in 3:18 as Lã Elãha Ella Allãh. And here it is again.\r\n                            42:47\r\n                            35, while they are in this dilemma, [37:35] When they were told, \"Lã Elãha Ella Allãh [There is no other god beside GOD],\" they turned arrogant. [37:36] They said, \"Shall we leave our gods for the sake of a crazy poet?\"\r\n                            43:00\r\n                            Wow, this is what this guy said. Shakira: But in that verse God says, remember He brought us all in front of Him. And then, so it's very clear there that we saw Him and He told us that. The messenger: Yes.\r\n                            43:13\r\n                            The messenger: Yes, and the word SHAHADA is used. Do you bear witness I am your Lord? And we said we bear witness.\r\n                            43:19\r\n                            (7:172) قَالُوا۟ بَلَىٰ ۛ شَهِدْنَآ I mean, God uses the same word. Oh, you didn't hear this before but that was a very good point that Parivash brought up.\r\n                            43:28\r\n                            Ismail Barakat: The word SHAHADA only applies to God. The messenger: No, but it's a fact. In Quran, God says\r\n                            43:34\r\n                            وَإِذْ أَخَذَ رَبُّكَ مِنۢ بَنِىٓ ءَادَمَ مِن ظُهُورِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَأَشْهَدَهُمْ عَلَىٰٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ أَلَسْتُ بِرَبِّكُمْ ۖ قَالُوا۟ بَلَىٰ ۛ شَهِدْنَآ (7:172)\r\n                            43:41\r\n                            So, this is in the Quran that every human being on earth witnessed that God is our Lord. We never witnessed that Muhammad is a messenger of God or ISA (Jesus) is a messenger of God or anybody is a messenger of God.\r\n                            43:56\r\n                            So, to say \"اشهد ان محمد رسول الله\" is a lie. In fact, this is why God says when the hypocrites say \"اشهد ان محمد رسول الله\", God says God knows you are His messenger and God knows they are liars, because they are stating a lie.\r\n                            44:10\r\n                            Even though the body is witness, but the person, the soul, has never witnessed that. So, it's a very good point.\r\n                            44:18\r\n                            Number 36, [37:36] They said, \"Shall we leave our gods for the sake of a crazy poet?\" [37:37] In fact, he has brought the truth, and has confirmed the messengers.\r\n                            44:27\r\n                            [37:38] Most assuredly, you will suffer the most painful retribution. [37:39] You only pay for what you did. [37:40] Only GOD's servants who are absolutely devoted to Him alone (will be saved). [37:41] They have deserved provisions that are reserved specifically for them.\r\n                            44:43\r\n                            [37:42] All kinds of fruits. They will be honored therein. [37:43] In the gardens of bliss. [37:44] On furnishings close to one another. [37:45] enjoying Cups of pure drinks. [37:46] Clear and delicious for the drinkers.\r\n                            44:54\r\n                            [37:47] Never polluted, and never exhausted. [37:48] With them will be beautiful [or handsome] companions. [37:49] Protected like fragile eggs.\r\n                            45:04\r\n                            The people of Heaven visit the people of Hell [37:50] They will confer with one another. [37:51] One will say, \"I used to have a friend. [37:52] \"He used to mock: 'Do you believe all this? [37:53] \"'After we die and turn into dust and bones, we get ressurected?'\"\r\n                            45:20\r\n                            [37:54] it will be proclaimed, \"Just take a look!\" [37:55] When he looks, he will see his friend in the heart of Hell. [37:56] He (will go to him and) say,\r\n                            45:28\r\n                            Now, number 57, wow, because 57... Sura 57 is where we see the disbelievers begging for some energy, some light from the believers in hell. You know those light bugs, Ismail? Those light bugs.\r\n                            45:46\r\n                            When the believers go to visit their friends, because the main feature of hell is darkness. They will be like fireflies, the light bugs.\r\n                            45:57\r\n                            And the 57, the disbelievers are begging, let us have some of your light. They will be starving for energy. And we see it here again at 57.\r\n                            46:07\r\n                            56 [37:56] He (will go to him and) say, \"By GOD, you almost ruined me. [37:57] \"If it were not for my Lord's grace, I would have been with you now. [37:58] \"(Do you still believe) that we die, [37:59] \"only the first death, then we never are requited?\"\r\n                            46:32\r\n                            60 [37:60] Such is the greatest triumph. [37:61] This is what every worker should work for. [37:62] Is this a better destiny, or the tree of bitterness? [37:63] We have rendered it a test for the transgressors.\r\n                            46:46\r\n                            [37:64] It is a tree that grows in the heart of Hell. [37:65] Its flowers are like the devils' heads. [37:66] They will eat from it until their bellies are full. [37:67] Then they will top it with a hellish drink.\r\n                            46:56\r\n                            a couple of Bloody Marys.\r\n                            47:03\r\n                            [37:68] Then they will return to Hell. [37:69] They followed their parents blindly. So I'm gonna stop right here, if there are no questions...\r\n                            47:20\r\n                            Page 214.\r\n                            47:30\r\n                            أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ\r\n                            47:35\r\n                            A woman: Salãmun ‘Alaykum The messenger: ‘Alaykum Salãm\r\n                            47:40\r\n                            [10:43] Some of them look at you, but can you guide the blind, even though they do not see? [10:44] GOD never wrongs the people; it is the people who wrong their own souls.\r\n                            47:50\r\n                            [10:45] On the day when He summons all of them, they will feel as if they lasted in this world only one hour, during which they met. Losers indeed are those who disbelieved in meeting GOD; and they are not guided.\r\n                            48:07\r\n                            [10:46] Whether we show you some (of the retribution) we promise them, or terminate your life before that, to us is their ultimate return. GOD is witnessing everything they do.\r\n                            48:20\r\n                            46 is a repeated verse in the Quran, and it really means that the people who advocate God alone will be ridiculed always by somebody until the last day of of their lives. It is what it means.\r\n                            48:42\r\n                            [10:46] Whether we show you some (of the retribution) we promise them, or terminate your life before that, to us is their ultimate return. GOD is witnessing everything they do.\r\n                            48:53\r\n                            [10:47] To each community, a messenger was sent. Once their messenger comes, they are judged equitably, without the least injustice.\r\n                            49:04\r\n                            I may have to go back and re-translate this, make it clearer. Community, people think community like eastern hills subdivision, something like that.\r\n                            49:21\r\n                            I think community in the Quran means like the Christians, Jesus, the Jews, Moses, you know, the Muslims, Muhammad. This is what it really means.\r\n                            49:36\r\n                            So, it is not a community or a generation, or a congregation. It could be the congregation, to each congregation a messenger. People have the Baptists, the Presbyterians, they are different congregations.\r\n                            49:58\r\n                            Yeah. Something like that.\r\n                            50:05\r\n                            What is Ummat in Farsi? What is the impression you get? Behrouz: A group of people. This is Arabic, we just use it.\r\n                            50:16\r\n                            The messenger: But you do have the word Ummat. So, when you hear it in Farsi, how big a group is it? How do you apply it in Farsi?\r\n                            50:27\r\n                            Behrouz: It's just a big group. The messenger: Oh, Ok. In the Quran, this is what it means. Behrouz: This word in Farsi is not used except in the translation of the Quran.\r\n                            50:44\r\n                            The messenger: Oh, Ok. Not in your daily language. Like the Ummat must listen to this.\r\n                            50:57\r\n                            The messenger: Yes, The Ummat is in trouble. This means the whole Muslim Ummat. It means all the Muslims in the world. 48.\r\n                            51:08\r\n                            [10:48] They challenge: \"When will this [asteroid come to hit us], if you are telling the truth?\"\r\n                            51:13\r\n                            The Messenger Possesses No Power [10:49] Say, \"I possess no power to even harm myself, or benefit myself;\r\n                            51:19\r\n                            It is God who will decide that. [10:49] ...only what GOD wills takes place.\" Each community has a predetermined life span. Once their interim comes to an end, they cannot delay it by one hour, nor advance it.\r\n                            51:36\r\n                            [10:50] Say, Now here, each community has a predetermined lifespan. Community here is like the Roman Empire, for example. There is a time for it, the Byzantine Empire, the American Empire.\r\n                            51:56\r\n                            It is like a whole nation, a country.\r\n                            52:06\r\n                            [10:50] Say, \"Whether His retribution comes to you by night or by day, why are the guilty in such a hurry?\r\n                            52:13\r\n                            [10:51] \"If it does happen, will you believe then? Why should you believe then when you already had challenged it to come?\"\r\n                            52:20\r\n                            They may be like Pharaoh, when they see the asteroid coming. (unintelligible).\r\n                            52:29\r\n                            Oh, really? Oh, wow. (unintelligible).\r\n                            52:37\r\n                            You're kidding? And you're sitting there in the corner, quiet? He is not sitting there. Look what it is. (unintelligible).\r\n                            52:44\r\n                            The messenger: Well, how do you know? Behrouz: How did you know?\r\n                            53:04\r\n                            The messenger: He's just sitting there. A man: One hour of broiling. The messenger: Wow. One hour of broiling. H. J. Melosh believes a meteor may have hit the planet, sparking a firestorm that destroyed most life on earth.\r\n                            53:30\r\n                            The messenger: This is the guy who published an article. He even has pictures and illustrations. A man: Look what it hit, the Arabs. The messenger: No, that's Europe.\r\n                            53:42\r\n                            The messenger: A comet or asteroid slams into earth. Oh, I wish I could put this in the...\r\n                            53:48\r\n                            Behrouz: (unintelligible).\r\n                            53:53\r\n                            The messenger: Vaporized rock and debris caused by the impact shoot into space. Vaporized smoke, vaporized rock. As the debris re-enters the atmosphere, each of the trillions of grains of sand will generate 1800 to 2000 degrees Fahrenheit incoming debris with surface.\r\n                            54:25\r\n                            That is the incoming debris. Thermal radiation cloud, source H. J. Melosh. Who is he? Imagine the entire sky erupting with fire. Smoke from the sky.\r\n                            54:42\r\n                            (44:10) فَٱرْتَقِبْ يَوْمَ تَأْتِى ٱلسَّمَآءُ بِدُخَانٍۢ مُّبِينٍۢ\r\n                            54:48\r\n                            The messenger: Now feel the heat from such a horror. Ten times hotter than high noon on a July day in the Arizona desert. Hot enough to ignite much of the world's forests, like so much timber. Hot enough to broil steaks, dinosaur steaks.\r\n                            55:11\r\n                            So, this is U.A. planetary scientist, H. J. Melosh and his colleagues say in an article published this week in Nature. OK, this is what has been mentioned last week in Nature.\r\n                            55:26\r\n                            Mahmoud: I'll get the nature magazine. The messenger: Yes, timing and the picture.\r\n                            55:38\r\n                            The messenger: Yeah, I have to rewrite that article now. Thanks, Mahmoud for informing us. Thanks for your job. Great job. \"Stand there, no customers, what to do? Oh, the paper is here. Let me glance through what happened to Somalia. Is Siad Barre still alive?\r\n                            56:00\r\n                            أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ 51.\r\n                            56:06\r\n                            [10:51] \"If it does happen, will you believe then? Why should you believe then when you already have challenged it to come?\" [10:52] It will be said to the transgressors, \"Taste the eternal retribution. Are you not requited precisely for what you earned?\"\r\n                            56:23\r\n                            [10:53] They challenge you to prophesy: \"Is this really what will happen?\" Say, \"Yes indeed, by my Lord, this is the truth, and you can never escape.\"\r\n                            56:31\r\n                            I think these verses are applicable to both of, for the perspective, because this is a crucial perspective.\r\n                            56:40\r\n                            What Price Faith, 54. [10:54] If any wicked soul possessed everything on earth, it would readily offer it as ransom. They will be ridden with remorse when they see the retribution. They will be judged equitably, without the least injustice.\r\n                            56:57\r\n                            The thing about these asteroids is that they can come in any sizes, you know. This is what he says killed the dinosaurs.\r\n                            57:14\r\n                            So, it doesn't have to be this size. It can come in any size that God chooses. Everything will be measured. And the description of Sura 34 is that, obviously, it will not end life on earth.\r\n                            57:25\r\n                            Mahmoud: And also it hit different places on earth. The one that he says killed the dinosaurs hit so many areas, the whole earth became ignited. It hits only one area.\r\n                            57:37\r\n                            The messenger: Yeah, this will be just in Arabia.\r\n                            57:47\r\n                            They don't say what he's holding in his hand. (unintelligible).\r\n                            58:03\r\n                            The messenger: No, no, it's an odd-shaped rock. A woman: (Unintelligible).\r\n                            58:09\r\n                            A woman: 95% iron and 5% metal. The messenger: I mean, we just one as big as this mosque inside Arabia. That will do it.\r\n                            58:19\r\n                            Mahmoud: (unintelligible) Behrouz: This is what we don't know. I'm sure it depends to the velocity of the object and the size that how much area is gonna...\r\n                            58:34\r\n                            Mahmoud: 40,000 miles an hour, speed. Behrouz: 40,000?\r\n                            58:40\r\n                            The messenger: It should be the same. Velocity will be the same.\r\n                            58:46\r\n                            Behrouz: And it's coming from the, I mean, 2 planets hit each other.\r\n                            58:54\r\n                            The messenger: No, no, they don't have to. Behrouz: They don't have to? So, what is it...? The messenger: When they hit each other, it will be a number of them. Because they break into pieces and all the pieces will fall.\r\n                            59:06\r\n                            Behrouz: So, this is where they're coming from. 2 planets hit each other... what else is it? The messenger: No.\r\n                            59:12\r\n                            The messenger: Pieces of meteorites float in the space, billions of them.\r\n                            59:17\r\n                            One of them will come and there's one now that intersects the orbit of the earth. You know what this means? Did you hear the test of it? The earth's orbit around the sun is like this.\r\n                            59:27\r\n                            So, the earth is here, the asteroid goes in the orbit like that. And then comes back and hits the orbit like that. It keeps doing this. So, one of those times the earth would be in that spot.\r\n                            59:47\r\n                            The messenger: The five daily prayers are so important that... Shakira: Are they the most important of all the prayers? The messenger: Definitely.\r\n                            59:55\r\n                            The messenger: This is a daily... Shakira: If one individual just prays 5 times a day, that person will reach a very high rank and another person who does all the other four duties but is not praying regularly, is that...\r\n                            1:00:12\r\n                            The messenger: You can't really divide it like this. A righteous person will do all of it. Shakira: But I have a feeling he has a computer and he puts everything in it and comes out easily.\r\n                            1:00:22\r\n                            The messenger: Yes, yes, that too. Every time he says \"Subhan Allah\", the computer clicks and reads it for him (unintelligible). And this is exactly what 115 means that Whatever righteous work they do,...\r\n                            1:00:42\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: [3:118] O you who believe, do not befriend outsiders who never cease to wish you harm; or wish to see you suffer. Hatred shows through their mouths and what their chests hide is even worse. We have clarified the revelations for you, that you may understand.\r\n                            1:01:00\r\n                            119. [3:119] Here you are loving them, while they do not love you, and you believe in all the scripture. When they meet you they say, \"We believe,\" then as soon as they leave they bite their fingers out of rage towards you. Say, \"Die in your rage.\" GOD is fully aware of the innermost thoughts.\r\n                            1:01:25\r\n                            120. [3:120] When something good touches you they hurt, and when something bad happens to you they rejoice. If you steadfastly persevere, and maintain righteousness, their schemes will never hurt you. GOD controls everything they do.\r\n                            1:01:41\r\n                            I'm stop here because I think these three are related to each other under the title: Do Not Befriend Hypocrites.\r\n                            1:01:53\r\n                            This is another lesson which we can relate it to that best community ever raised among the people. That God is telling us that be aware of the outsiders\r\n                            1:02:11\r\n                            who never cease to wish you harm and wish to see you suffer. The only person or people who can be like that, to suffer, to wish harm and want to see other people suffer,\r\n                            1:02:30\r\n                            they should be devilish. There is no humanity involved because that is the time that you have completely\r\n                            1:02:44\r\n                            given up your soul to the Satan. Because these are the things which are satanic, wishing other people harm and suffering. A righteous person, a person who believes in God\r\n                            1:02:58\r\n                            and is leading a righteous life, he or she never wants suffering or harm for anybody else.\r\n                            1:03:11\r\n                            God is saying that hatred shows through their mouths and what their chest hide is even worse. That's very interesting. People who are like this, people who enjoy seeing other people suffer,\r\n                            1:03:24\r\n                            they harm themselves. They hurt themselves. They suffer more than the others because you live your life, you believe in God, you are living a life that you think you believe is the righteous life,\r\n                            1:03:38\r\n                            but those people who have nothing else to just watch you and suffer because they suffer with the way that you walk, the way you talk, the way you eat.\r\n                            1:03:52\r\n                            They just, whatever they do, they are the ones who are looking for something. They just all the time are, because they are full of so much hatred, which God says hatred shows through their mouths\r\n                            1:04:08\r\n                            and what their chest is hiding is worse. I have seen it through my own life that no matter what you do, sometimes you are even unaware of the fact that some people are watching you and are suffering because of what you do.\r\n                            1:04:26\r\n                            You are just doing it naturally because of your beliefs, but others who are watching you, they get hurt. It's just, either it's unacceptable to them or for no reason. For example, if I go and tell a friend that I go to\r\n                            1:04:43\r\n                            Friday prayers, first of all they look at me and say \"hey, what is wrong with you? you know. What are you up to? Why you go to...\" Because it is the tradition in the Muslim world that\r\n                            1:04:58\r\n                            either you are stupid and follow God's revelations, especially among the educated, or you are after something. Other than that, there is no reason for you to go to a Friday prayer\r\n                            1:05:10\r\n                            or go and spend your time reading the Quran. This is the fact. So, as soon as they hear that, their receivers in their radars start collecting all the signals.\r\n                            1:05:22\r\n                            And You wouldn't believe how many channels they have to receive. You are emitting on one channel, but they have a million channels receiving.\r\n                            1:05:31\r\n                            So, they are the ones who worry about it. You don't worry, you're just leading what, you're doing what you believe is right, and hopefully it is, but they are the ones who are worrying\r\n                            1:05:46\r\n                            what is going on. Because they, although they say that they don't want to follow you, they don't wanna do the same thing that you do, but somehow, for some reason,\r\n                            1:05:59\r\n                            they are so much interested. They wanna see it. You know, they wanna know why. And when you tell them, then it's like talking to a stone wall.\r\n                            1:06:11\r\n                            [3:118] it's for you, that you may understand. [3:119] Here you are loving them, while they do not love you, and you believe in all the scripture.\r\n                            1:06:21\r\n                            This is why you love everyone else, as God says in the verses that they refer to. A righteous person, a believer, doesn't see any distinction among anybody else, and sees everyone the same.\r\n                            1:06:37\r\n                            That is what we have a lot of discussion with my own kids, who are sleeping, both of them, more or less, about racial issues, you know, how we can blame other people for being racist,\r\n                            1:06:51\r\n                            how we can blame other people looking at us differently, rather than looking, you know, similar to everybody else. But the fact is, I have to go first back to my own system,\r\n                            1:07:04\r\n                            and see whether I see anybody else differently, whether I see a white person from a black person, an oriental from an Iranian, and so on and so forth. If I can do, if I can clean myself,\r\n                            1:07:20\r\n                            if I can purify my own soul, to see everyone else the same, then I won't have any problem with other people, because if they look at me, and\r\n                            1:07:30\r\n                            they think that I am a different race, or they are racist, I look at them and I see that they are suffering, as God is saying exactly, they are the ones who are suffering\r\n                            1:07:41\r\n                            because they think that they want you to suffer, they enjoy it, but if you purify your own self, and get to the point that you are a righteous person, you don't see any difference between any other people\r\n                            1:07:57\r\n                            and then you don't care about what the other people see, and that is what is expected from you.\r\n                            1:08:06\r\n                            [3:119] ...When they meet you they say, \"We believe,\" I think most of us have that experience.\r\n                            1:08:13\r\n                            [3:119] ...then as soon as they leave they bite their fingers out of rage towards you. Say, \"Die in your rage.\" GOD is fully aware of the innermost thoughts.\r\n                            1:08:24\r\n                            So, this is, I'm not gonna talk more about it, it's very clear, and 120.\r\n                            1:08:33\r\n                            [3:120] When something good touches you they hurt, and when something bad happens to you they rejoice. If you steadfastly persevere, and maintain righteousness, their schemes will never hurt you. GOD controls everything they do.\r\n                            1:08:46\r\n                            God is giving assurance to us, that if we put all of our faith in Him, and follow what He tells us to follow, then we have nothing to worry, that's the best expression.\r\n                            1:09:02\r\n                            Nothing to fear, nothing to grieve, and the people who are hurt, who grieve, who are jealous,\r\n                            1:09:15\r\n                            they are suffering, let be it. I have nothing to do with it. That's the life that they chose.\r\n                            1:09:21\r\n                            That's the way that they are going, and this is the way that I am going. So, God is assuring us that He is aware, and He is controlling everything they do.\r\n                            1:09:33\r\n                            And so I don't have to worry about it, and think too much about it. It's a very, very good lesson that I don't mean,\r\n                            1:09:46\r\n                            don't get me wrong, that you don't have to do your responsibilities, because God is\r\n                            1:09:53\r\n                            exactly telling us that if you are part of that community, you always have to be aware.\r\n                            1:09:59\r\n                            You have to be advocating righteousness and forbidding evil, which is part of the community work,\r\n                            1:10:04\r\n                            work or part of your social responsibilities, but if you put too much emphasis on what other people say about you, or think about you, then that's the time that you are in trouble. I stop here,\r\n                            1:10:16\r\n                            before starting 121, for questions and discussions again.\r\n                            1:10:25\r\n                            A man: Verse 119, where God says, that as soon as they leave, they bite their fingers out of rage. In Sura 25, verse 27 on page 362, God says\r\n                            1:10:41\r\n                            [25:27] The day will come when the transgressor will bite his hands (in anguish)...\r\n                            1:10:46\r\n                            What I think is interesting here, very beautiful and interesting, is that God says that he knows what is in the chest, and He says, in Sura 3, verse 119, He's fully aware of your innermost thoughts.\r\n                            1:11:00\r\n                            This tendency to bite one's hands in an abnormal way, and bite the fingers, is very common in a person's anger and rage, and suffering.\r\n                            1:11:12\r\n                            They may appear to be otherwise, but this is something that can actually recognize, if possible, one kind of indication that a person has this anxiety and anguish, and God knows it.\r\n                            1:11:23\r\n                            And I see these two verses where we're talking about anger, rage, and God knows what is in the heart,\r\n                            1:11:30\r\n                            and He knows what human beings do, certain habits they develop as a function of whether\r\n                            1:11:35\r\n                            or not they're in a state of peace, or they are in a state of anguish or rage. So in that\r\n                            1:11:42\r\n                            sense, God is, He is aware, He knows the relationship between behavior, certain habits, the things\r\n                            1:11:51\r\n                            we do, and what's happening inside us. And we see the major thing here, of the anguish, the rage and the suffering.\r\n                            1:12:05\r\n                            The messenger: I wanna talk about John 18, well, I mean, actually there are three of them. We are people who decided that God knows best, and we don't go to anyone else for what is good for us, what is bad for us.\r\n                            1:12:18\r\n                            and we are His servants and creatures, and we decided we're gonna obey what He tells us. And God has a very good reason for any of these commandments.\r\n                            1:12:28\r\n                            Now here, He's telling us, all you who believe, do not befriend outsiders, etc. etc.\r\n                            1:12:34\r\n                            He says \"Do not befriend them.\" Why is God telling us this?\r\n                            1:12:39\r\n                            From the experience we've seen in the last 12 years in this Masjid, it's because these people, the outsiders,\r\n                            1:12:49\r\n                            these people may take you away. And we know what this means. Actually, they will do everything possible\r\n                            1:12:59\r\n                            to stop you from being here, from continuing to worship God and follow His commandments.\r\n                            1:13:07\r\n                            And this is the biggest disaster that can ever happen to anybody. And we've seen it happen,\r\n                            1:13:12\r\n                            and we've seen it happen, we've seen the consequences for those people. And then God is giving criteria and descriptions of these people. So, a good subtitle here will be: Run for your life.\r\n                            1:13:28\r\n                            When you meet these people and sense that they are not totally\r\n                            1:13:33\r\n                            in agreement with following God's commandments, for example if they mock the Friday prayers,\r\n                            1:13:40\r\n                            I'm telling you, I've seen people who were dismissed from God's grace because of not doing the Friday prayers.\r\n                            1:13:46\r\n                            They didn't have excuses. You have a very good excuse, a very good excuse.\r\n                            1:13:53\r\n                            But God knows. It's between you and God, that you cannot possibly make the Friday prayers, that's fine. But these are people who, in their mind, it is not important to do the Friday prayer.\r\n                            1:14:03\r\n                            When God says \"when the Friday prayer comes, go to the Friday prayer and drop all business.\" God is saying this.\r\n                            1:14:09\r\n                            So, I mean, we're either believers who follow God and obey him, or will not. There is no in between.\r\n                            1:14:15\r\n                            God is saying \"O you who believe, do not befriend outsiders who,\" etc, etc, all the descriptions. What is God's interest in this?\r\n                            1:14:23\r\n                            Our welfare. Because if we mix with them, they will influence us.\r\n                            1:14:31\r\n                            And there is that chance or that possibility that may take us away from the path of God, and this is the biggest disaster.\r\n                            1:14:38\r\n                            Especially, when you come this close. When you're sitting here at noon witnessing miracles, right? Witnessing miracles, greater than Moses' miracles when he threw down the staff.\r\n                            1:14:51\r\n                            So, after seeing all this, when you see God's commandment, God says \"do not befriend them.\" Maybe you can talk to them. But befriend is a very dangerous disobedience of God.\r\n                            1:15:07\r\n                            Mahmoud: According to Quran, believers have the most powerful truth, and they do not (unintelligible) with people on the subject.\r\n                            1:15:17\r\n                            But those people here, who don't have any base or any discretion. Those people, they are not mischievous people.\r\n                            1:15:27\r\n                            They are playing in both sides. And for this reason, those people, to befriend these people will not\r\n                            1:15:34\r\n                            give you anything. You will not gain anything from them. They will not gain anything from you because really they are not sincere.\r\n                            1:15:41\r\n                            The messenger: Even disastrous. Mahmoud: Yes, only they will give you bad things.\r\n                            1:15:46\r\n                            The messenger: Of course, you can try to help them, guide them, but once you have done this, you delivered the message, you tried to help them, and then you find that they are not responding,\r\n                            1:15:57\r\n                            and they continue their defiance of God and mocking you and so on. Run for your life.\r\n                            1:16:05\r\n                            It's a very important commandment. You will not take God's orders lightly. \"O you who believe, do not befriend outsiders who never cease to wish you harm, etc.\" Now, you take this seriously.\r\n                            1:16:24\r\n                            The messenger: Back to Dr. Subahi and one... Dr. Sabahi: Abdullah, I think. Abdullah: I have a comment.\r\n                            1:16:32\r\n                            Abdullah: Believers are recognized, righteous people are recognized by the people who don't believe in the Hereafter. And the reason they want, although they say they don't believe in what you're doing,\r\n                            1:16:51\r\n                            deep inside they think you might be right. And they are scared. They want you to be in the same pot with them.\r\n                            1:17:04\r\n                            And the only way they can see is that you're wrong, there's something bad that happens to you, and they look forward to something bad will happen to you, but it never happens.\r\n                            1:17:20\r\n                            If it happens, they rejoice. If it doesn't happen, they're outraged inside.\r\n                            1:17:31\r\n                            It's just because deep in their heart, they think you might be right and they'll be in\r\n                            1:17:44\r\n                            real trouble. And they wanna tell you what to do to be in the same pot, same problem. Abdullah is\r\n                            1:17:52\r\n                            The messenger: Abdullah is quoting 4:89, you know. Let's look at it, 4:89, it's exactly what God is telling us. It's a very good psychological analysis.\r\n                            1:18:06\r\n                            Page 92 says, [4:89] They wish that you disbelieve as they have disbelieved, then you become equal.\r\n                            1:18:12\r\n                            to be in the same boat with them.\r\n                            1:18:20\r\n                            It's just they feel that, I don't know, I have a feeling that they sense your soul, the size of your soul, it kind of bothers them. You have a strong soul, you go there and you'll take over.\r\n                            1:18:35\r\n                            So, they want you to be in the same boat as they are. Ok. 121, The Battle of Badr.\r\n                            1:18:45\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: 121, The Battle of Badr. [3:121] Recall that you (Muhammad) set out to assign to your people their positions for battle. And GOD is Hearer, Omniscient.\r\n                            1:18:59\r\n                            122. [3:122] Two groups of you almost failed, and GOD was their Lord. In GOD the believers shall trust.\r\n                            1:19:09\r\n                            [3:123] Thus, GOD gave you victory at Badr, even though you were weak. you shall observe GOD, to show your appreciation. [3:124] You told the believers, \"Is it not enough that your Lord supports you with three thousand angels, descending?\"\r\n                            1:19:24\r\n                            [3:125] Yes, if you steadfastly persevere and maintain righteousness, then they attack you suddenly, your Lord will supply you with five thousand* angels, well trained.\r\n                            1:19:37\r\n                            126. [3:126] GOD gives you, this good news, to assure your hearts. Victory comes only from GOD, the Almighty, Most Wise.\r\n                            1:19:47\r\n                            127. [3:127] He thus annihilates some disbelievers, or neutralizes them; so they end up in failure.\r\n                            1:19:56\r\n                            128. [3:128] It is not up to you; He may redeem them, or punish them for their sins.\r\n                            1:20:02\r\n                            129. [3:129] To GOD belongs everything in the heavens and everything on the earth. He forgives whomever He wills, and punishes whomever He wills. GOD is Forgiver, Merciful.\r\n                            1:20:15\r\n                            I stop here. 121 to 129 is, as the subtitle says, is about the Battle of Badr,\r\n                            1:20:27\r\n                            which, I think, it is the first battle that Muhammad and his followers had to fight against disbelievers. God is reminding Muhammad that when you\r\n                            1:20:48\r\n                            were assigning people in the position for battle, they knew that they are going to attack them in their town, that community that they had, and there were this bunch of, this group of\r\n                            1:20:59\r\n                            believers with the prophet, and they were ready to defend. And of course, it seems that\r\n                            1:21:09\r\n                            not all of those people were at the same level of belief. There were some who were better believers, they were stronger believers, and maybe there were people who had some\r\n                            1:21:23\r\n                            some doubts in how far or how much God can help them. So, God is reminding Muhammad that when you\r\n                            1:21:32\r\n                            were assigning your people for the positions for the battle, two groups of you almost failed,\r\n                            1:21:42\r\n                            and God was their Lord. Although two groups of you failed, since I don't know the exact\r\n                            1:21:51\r\n                            history of the Battle of Badr, I don't know if this failure is in the real battle\r\n                            1:21:57\r\n                            that they went out and fought and failed, or they failed the test, because this was a test of\r\n                            1:22:04\r\n                            how much you believe. Imagine that something happens outside, you know, now we have to go\r\n                            1:22:11\r\n                            and put our lives, say, okay, this is for God, and God wants us to go and fight these people who are attacking this mosque.\r\n                            1:22:20\r\n                            And then, that's the real test. This is one of the most precious things that you like, is your life. You have to go and risk your life\r\n                            1:22:29\r\n                            in the cause of God, you know, it is for God. So, it seems that if people have different\r\n                            1:22:35\r\n                            levels of belief, some people may doubt it, say \"is this real battle? Is this really Muhammad, right, that this is for God?\" And then you question.\r\n                            1:22:47\r\n                            And God is saying that two groups of you almost failed in that,\r\n                            1:22:53\r\n                            because those people didn't trust or didn't believe that God can help them with his angels.\r\n                            1:23:00\r\n                            And then, God is saying in 123, that [3:123] GOD gave you victory at Badr, even though you were weak.\r\n                            1:23:06\r\n                            you know, outnumbered, weaker, maybe the other side had better arsenal. And God is reminding them that you shall observe God to show your\r\n                            1:23:18\r\n                            appreciation. He helped you. He made you victorious over the disbelievers, and you should remember, you have to always remember God.\r\n                            1:23:28\r\n                            [3:124] You told the believers, \"Is it not enough that your Lord supports you with three thousand angels?\"\r\n                            1:23:35\r\n                            [3:125] Yes, if you steadfastly persevere and maintain righteousness, then they attack you suddenly, your Lord will supply you with five thousand angels, well trained.\r\n                            1:23:44\r\n                            This clearly shows that how a believer, as Rashad just very, I think, beautifully put it, if you are a believer, you have so much strength, you have something you\r\n                            1:23:59\r\n                            that even at the everyday life causes that strength. It shows in your system. You know, you walk, you talk with more strength, with self-confidence, because\r\n                            1:24:14\r\n                            as was mentioned in today's Khutba. Since you believe in God, you believe in someone Who is the Superior Force, who is the Creator of the whole universe.\r\n                            1:24:27\r\n                            So, you see everybody else the same. You don't worry about your boss. You don't worry about anything. You, your soul has grown so big,\r\n                            1:24:38\r\n                            hopefully, that if you go in a room with some disbelievers, then there is not enough room, they just get pushed, they get squished.\r\n                            1:24:47\r\n                            So, and that's the time that God comes to your help. You go in a community and you see that. This reminds me of a story that I was told, I don't know whether I told you this or not.\r\n                            1:25:02\r\n                            Tariq is here. I was talking to his parents, because they are Muslims. And they were saying that the first time they were exposed to Islam,\r\n                            1:25:11\r\n                            through Elijah Muhammad, in Brooklyn, New York, before that they were just normal people.\r\n                            1:25:19\r\n                            They were always thought that they are inferior to other people and so on and so forth.\r\n                            1:25:28\r\n                            But when they went through and they were introduced into what was told to them that this is Islam,\r\n                            1:25:35\r\n                            whatever it was, that there is a God, Allah, you have to follow Him, you believe in Him, and if you follow that, you do your prayers, then you are strong. And they were saying that after they even got that close to the real thing, which is believing in God,\r\n                            1:25:53\r\n                            which then, as we know the history of the black Muslim movement in this country, which I'm sure\r\n                            1:26:02\r\n                            Douglas is in a better position to tell us about it, but the thing that was interesting\r\n                            1:26:11\r\n                            to me was the strength that they said they felt with this. They said that all of a sudden\r\n                            1:26:16\r\n                            they felt that God is giving them so much strength that they would go to places that\r\n                            1:26:21\r\n                            they never imagined that they could go. They would go to places which were drug dealers\r\n                            1:26:27\r\n                            with shotguns, you know, and they were saying that they would go to these places, and all of these\r\n                            1:26:32\r\n                            nastiest people in the world that live in that area were afraid of them. Even they had shotguns, even they had knives, even whatever. And that shows, this is an example, but God\r\n                            1:26:46\r\n                            is telling us exactly that if you believe in Him, He's going to support you. The angels,\r\n                            1:26:53\r\n                            the numbers that are given here, which in the footnote, you can see that the numbers that are in the Quran are multiple of 19. God is giving these numbers and telling us that\r\n                            1:27:07\r\n                            in everyday life and also in the real battles that have happened in the past, and\r\n                            1:27:13\r\n                            may happen in other forms. It doesn't have to be battles that you fight with bombs and\r\n                            1:27:20\r\n                            guns and so on. Everyday battle with believers, which nowadays is mostly through, through communications,\r\n                            1:27:30\r\n                            then God is going to help you to be winners. 126,\r\n                            1:27:36\r\n                            [3:126] GOD gives this you good news, to assure your hearts. Victory comes only from GOD, the Almighty, Most Wise.\r\n                            1:27:42\r\n                            This is the reassurance that God has given us, the good news. [3:127] He thus annihilates some disbelievers, or neutralizes them; so they end up in failure.\r\n                            1:27:53\r\n                            [3:128] It is not up to you; He may redeem them, or punish them for their sins.\r\n                            1:28:00\r\n                            After you have done your work, you have done your job, it is not up to you. I don't know why always when I teach one of these verses come up, that it's not up to you. He may redeem them or punish them for their sins. So, you have to do your homework,\r\n                            1:28:17\r\n                            you have to do your job. The rest of it is up to God to decide what He wants to do with the disbeliever.\r\n                            1:28:25\r\n                            [3:129] To GOD belongs everything in the heavens and [everything on] the earth. He forgives whomever He wills, and punishes whomever He wills. GOD is Forgiver, Merciful.\r\n                            1:28:35\r\n                            I stop for discussion and questions here.\r\n                            1:28:41\r\n                            The messenger: Well, I have lots to say here. Are there any questions before I say that? First of all, I urge you or encourage you to go to any public library\r\n                            1:28:51\r\n                            and look up the Encyclopedia Britannica under Badr. B A D R. And in the Encyclopedia Britannica they give you\r\n                            1:29:01\r\n                            the numbers of equipment on both sides, the disbelievers and the believers.\r\n                            1:29:06\r\n                            And you can see according to those numbers from history, that the disbelievers vastly outnumber the believers for at least ten times as much in every category.\r\n                            1:29:16\r\n                            I mean seventy camels against seven things, actually more than that. Look it up in the Encyclopedia Britannica.\r\n                            1:29:25\r\n                            And then you look at the outcome of this battle and they say that militarily\r\n                            1:29:30\r\n                            it doesn't make sense. The outcome doesn't make sense. Of course, they couldn't count the invisible force of the three thousand.\r\n                            1:29:39\r\n                            If you don't see the three thousand angels on the side of the believers. So, this will be quite a point.\r\n                            1:29:48\r\n                            A woman: How did they describe each side? Did they describe the believers and disbelievers? The messenger: Yes, they described the Muhammad side and the pagan side.\r\n                            1:29:56\r\n                            The messenger: It's quite fair, what I read. It was many years ago when I read it. They\r\n                            1:30:01\r\n                            (unintelligible). The messenger: So, just go and look for it in any public library, in Encyclopedia Britannica, under Badr and you'll see this.\r\n                            1:30:11\r\n                            A woman: It's in the history of Islam also, the life of the Prophet Muhammad. The messenger: See, Britannica is a neutral, it pretends to be neutral.\r\n                            1:30:21\r\n                            But the history of Islam, we'll see they're biased. But Britannica is in a public library. Everybody reads it. It's written by the most outstanding authorities on the subject, fully presented.\r\n                            1:30:37\r\n                            The other thing I wanna say is, you notice this is specifically the time of the Prophet Muhammad that was...\r\n                            1:30:44\r\n                            I maintained that the time of Jihad was then, but now the battle is completely mental.\r\n                            1:30:51\r\n                            However, I wanna share with you a few instances where there may be this simulation of Jihad or something.\r\n                            1:31:00\r\n                            For example, in my first visit to Canada, I don't know if you still have the scar there.\r\n                            1:31:08\r\n                            But there were so many threats against my life before I went, and Satan participated heavily in that\r\n                            1:31:15\r\n                            to the point that I left Canada knowing that I will die there. This is the impression that I...\r\n                            1:31:22\r\n                            There were very strange things happening. For example, the day before I left, I'm sitting peacefully watching the TV at home, and all of a sudden my wife says \"you have insurance on your life?\"\r\n                            \r\n                            \r\n                            \r\n                            05 Quran Study From Azhar 5 Sura 56;75 & Sura 57 By Lisa 02 17 1989\r\n                            \r\n                            Lisa: أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ\r\n                            0:21\r\n                            Lisa: بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ Lisa: As Rashad said we're starting with verse 75.\r\n                            0:34\r\n                            In Sura 56, verse 75,\r\n                            0:42\r\n                            The Honorable Quran\r\n                            0:48\r\n                            [56:75] I swear by the positions of the stars. [56:76] [and it] is an [awesome] oath, if you only knew.\r\n                            0:55\r\n                            I'd like to stop there for just a second, because we could talk about that all night.\r\n                            1:04\r\n                            We know now, though it was not known 1,500, 1,400 years ago, how awesome an oath this truly is.\r\n                            1:15\r\n                            1,400 years ago, they could see the stars and looking up in the sky being awed by them\r\n                            1:21\r\n                            as we are today.

It's beyond our comprehension.\r\n                            2:09\r\n                            Our sun is only one of perhaps a million stars within our galaxy, the Milky Way.\r\n                            2:15\r\n                            The size of the Milky Way is awesome. It would take us 100,000 years at the speed of light to cross it from one end to the other,\r\n                            2:26\r\n                            bearing in mind that the sun's light travels 93 million miles in four minutes.\r\n                            2:39\r\n                            We can appreciate the vastness of the Milky Way. It's 100,000 light years across.\r\n                            2:46\r\n                            From the outer limit of our galaxy, how significant is the planet Earth of the solar system?\r\n                            2:53\r\n                            Our next door, neighbor galaxy, the closest galaxy to our Milky Way, is 2 million light\r\n                            3:02\r\n                            years away.

If we go to the center of our neighbor galaxy, can we visualize the planet Earth of the Milky Way galaxy?\r\n                            3:19\r\n                            How significant is it at that distance? By moving away from our galaxy to the nearest galaxy to us, we are already talking about\r\n                            3:29\r\n                            incredible distances, millions of light years, yet our universe contains a great number of galaxies.\r\n                            3:36\r\n                            Back in the 1950s, Shane and Wharton drew the first map of the universe and its galaxies.\r\n                            3:44\r\n                            1,000 galaxies were surveyed then. And since then, scientists have discovered 1 billion galaxies, more than a million times\r\n                            3:54\r\n                            what was known 30 years ago.\r\n                            4:00\r\n                            Can you imagine the vastness of our universe with its billion galaxies and billion trillion stars?\r\n                            4:05\r\n                            We are now talking about billions of light years within our universe.\r\n                            4:15\r\n                            Have you lost track of our planet Earth? How significant is our planet Earth?\r\n                            4:35\r\n                            It is very important to keep this size and our significance, or perspective, in order to appreciate the significance or insignificance\r\n                            4:45\r\n                            of teeny creatures who inhabited this planet for a brief period of time.\r\n                            4:52\r\n                            And then we have one of the Psalms. This is from Psalm 8.\r\n                            4:57\r\n                            When I behold your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and stars which you set\r\n                            5:03\r\n                            in place, what is man that you should be mindful of him, or the son of man that you should care for him?\r\n                            5:17\r\n                            And yet we get up in the morning and we think, we're so important.\r\n                            5:23\r\n                            This is truly an awesome oath. And God is swearing. [56:75] I swear by the positions of the stars. [56:76] [and it] is an [awesome] oath, if you only knew.\r\n                            5:34\r\n                            [56:77] This is an honorable Quran. [56:78] In a [perfectly preserved] book.\r\n                            5:40\r\n                            [56:79] None can [touch] it except the [righteous]. [56:80] A revelation from the Lord of the universe.\r\n                            5:48\r\n                            We have in our hands the only thing that we need.\r\n                            5:53\r\n                            God has blessed us with this incredible blessing. This is our roadmap back to God.\r\n                            6:01\r\n                            And we know that it is an honorable Quran, and it has been perfectly preserved.\r\n                            6:09\r\n                            We in this mosque know that better than any people on earth. We've been incredibly blessed, incredibly blessed.\r\n                            6:21\r\n                            The miracles continue to come, flooding us, absolutely flooding us, showing in no uncertain\r\n                            6:32\r\n                            terms that this book is perfectly preserved, and that not only is it perfectly preserved,\r\n                            6:38\r\n                            but it is so incredibly coded that there is no way that any human being could have even\r\n                            6:43\r\n                            approached, to the slightest degree, approached writing even one Sura.\r\n                            6:50\r\n                            It's beyond us, truly, for me.\r\n                            6:56\r\n                            And we know now also that none can touch it except the righteous. What does that mean?\r\n                            7:02\r\n                            I mean, that doesn't mean physically touch it, but it means that no one can get from this Quran unless they are righteous, unless they are truly seeking God.\r\n                            7:11\r\n                            And beyond that, and more importantly for us at this point, we know that no one could\r\n                            7:17\r\n                            discover this miracle without being righteous. There is no way. This miracle is as awesome as anything we can imagine.\r\n                            7:26\r\n                            God has already sworn by the position of the stars that this is enough, this Quran is honorable\r\n                            7:34\r\n                            and it is perfectly preserved. And that is overwhelming. It's absolutely overwhelming.\r\n                            7:41\r\n                            So, we know, first of all, we know that this Quran has been preserved, but we also are given very clearly, the strongest of proofs, that the discoverer of this code is indeed\r\n                            7:56\r\n                            righteous, which is something that of course we will all hear it otherwise, because that's\r\n                            8:03\r\n                            the way Satan works. That's the way we all get trapped. But we know very clearly that the miracle and the revelation itself had to have come from God.\r\n                            8:20\r\n                            There is no way we could have made it up, or could have been tricked from God,\r\n                            8:28\r\n                            that anyone could have tricked God to discover the miracle any more than they could have tricked God to be the prophet whom the revelation was given.\r\n                            8:42\r\n                            Verse 81, [56:81] Are you disregarding this [message]? [56:82] Do you make it your [share] that you [reject it]?\r\n                            8:51\r\n                            [56:83] (your soul) [will] reach your throat— [someday] [56:84] [then] you will look around. [56:85] We are closer to it than you are, but you [can] not see.\r\n                            9:02\r\n                            [56:86] If you do [have] any [power]— [56:87] you [should reclaim] (your soul), if you are truthful?\r\n                            9:09\r\n                            Look at how many people are fighting, fighting this miracle.\r\n                            9:14\r\n                            These verses to me are specifically directed to them, as well as obviously to those who rejected the Quran.\r\n                            9:24\r\n                            Are you evading this message? God has already said that the Quran is perfectly preserved, that none can touch it except the righteous,\r\n                            9:33\r\n                            and yet there are those who say that they are Muslim, who say that they have\r\n                            9:38\r\n                            studied the Quran, and yet they reject the numerical code. And they do it out of ego, because they don't like what it leads to, which is worshipping\r\n                            9:48\r\n                            God alone, and leaving all the tradition, all of the falsehood, all of the garbage, and coming back to the very simple truth.\r\n                            9:57\r\n                            It is very simple. It's not easy until you make it easy, until you allow it to be easy.\r\n                            10:05\r\n                            It's very simple, and it's very straightforward and clear-cut.\r\n                            10:12\r\n                            Those who are evading this message, and that's truly what it is, I mean, anyone who reads this, reads this Quran, has to evade it or follow it.\r\n                            10:22\r\n                            If you follow it, there's no way you can follow the Hadith and Sunnah, there's no way you can accept all the other garbage if you are following the Quran.\r\n                            10:30\r\n                            So, if you're reading it, and you're still following the Hadith and Sunnah, you are evading\r\n                            10:36\r\n                            the Quran.\r\n                            10:42\r\n                            [56:82] Do you make it your [share] that you [reject it]? Well, it takes a lot of work, I think, on some level, not to accept the truth.\r\n                            10:53\r\n                            You have to work at rejecting the truth, and I think that when you tend to do that,\r\n                            10:58\r\n                            or when you do that, then you become fanatic about it. Personally, that's a lot of what we're seeing.\r\n                            11:09\r\n                            And it's very clear from the next verses that none of us control our lives. None of us can\r\n                            11:16\r\n                            stop death when it comes. God is closer to us than our jugular vein.\r\n                            11:23\r\n                            He stands between us and our hearts. We know that God is in control of every, the minutest detail in the universe.\r\n                            11:34\r\n                            He controls every atom, every subatomic particle within our body, within the rest of the universe.\r\n                            11:44\r\n                            That power is so awesome and so incomprehensible to us that it's probably easier for most people\r\n                            11:51\r\n                            to ignore it, because it's too scary to realize that there is a power that is that great.\r\n                            12:00\r\n                            And yet, we're here to come back to that realization. We're here because we did not remember that when we were in God's presence on the heavenly\r\n                            12:14\r\n                            plane, and we're here again, as Laurie so beautifully expressed, we're here again to\r\n                            12:23\r\n                            try and come back within a second chance.\r\n                            12:28\r\n                            Should I, can I stop here? Are there any questions or comments?\r\n                            12:47\r\n                            Oh, I'm sorry, I don't know when we are because of the meeting. Not sure.\r\n                            12:53\r\n                            I'm sorry, thank you. Excuse me.\r\n                            12:58\r\n                            The footnote: the Quran is by no means a regular book. Only the sincere seekers of the truth will be allowed to understand it.\r\n                            13:06\r\n                            See 41:44. The insincere will be prevented from acquiring any knowledge from the Quran.\r\n                            13:13\r\n                            In fact, those who are prevented by God from learning the Quran claim that this verse means\r\n                            13:18\r\n                            that no one can physically touch the Quran unless he satisfies certain ablution requirements.\r\n                            13:23\r\n                            Obviously, this distortion is a clever satanic plot to prevent people from studying God's\r\n                            13:29\r\n                            message to them. Our salvation is in reading, studying, and heeding the Quran.\r\n                            13:37\r\n                            The messenger: It's not really \"touch\", the English word... the Arabic word does not mean touch in English.\r\n                            13:42\r\n                            I will have to find another word. But still in English, you can say that means that nobody can derive anything else from the Quran unless they are sincere.\r\n                            13:59\r\n                            But in Arabic the word is يَمَسُّهُ And it's different from يلمس یلمس is physical touch but يَمَسُّهُ is touch in this meaning that they cannot take, derive, understand anything from its letters, you see.\r\n                            14:16\r\n                            Because your teacher is God. When you read this book, you're directly being taught by God,\r\n                            14:22\r\n                            as we read in Sura 55. It's not a regular book. That's why you read it over and over a thousand times, and you still find new things every time.\r\n                            14:32\r\n                            Unlike a novel, you read a novel and that's it, you throw it away, you don't wanna see it again.\r\n                            14:38\r\n                            So, because every time you look in it, God gives you new information.\r\n                            14:44\r\n                            This is, in verse 77, the Quran in Arabic is described as KARIM.\r\n                            14:49\r\n                            In other places, it's called Quran 'AZIM. And in Sura 50, it's described as Quran MAJID, glorious. 'AZIM, great. KARIM, honorable.\r\n                            15:00\r\n                            So, these are actually attributes of God Himself.\r\n                            15:05\r\n                            This is awesome, to describe the Quran with the same names of God.\r\n                            15:11\r\n                            'AZIM, MAJID, KARIM. It tells you how great this book is. Your salvation is in this book.\r\n                            15:19\r\n                            And we're really, really fortunate to be studying it every week. And in the Quran itself, hopefully you're reading it every day, at least one verse every day. Make it a duty upon yourself.\r\n                            15:32\r\n                            Because it's a tremendous blessing. [56:79] None can [touch] it except the [righteous].\r\n                            15:39\r\n                            And we have an international observation to prove this.\r\n                            15:47\r\n                            In the miracle of Quran that is coming out of this mosque, that it is a miracle that is\r\n                            15:54\r\n                            like the Quran, ranges from the very simple to the very complex.\r\n                            16:00\r\n                            Yet, nobody was allowed to make any discovery in this miracle except those who are connected with us,\r\n                            16:07\r\n                            connected with believers, only believers, who believe like we do.\r\n                            16:12\r\n                            We believe in worshipping God alone, and upholding the word of God alone.\r\n                            16:18\r\n                            Just look at the people who made discoveries. I want to pass this around. Let's do it very fast. Just take one and pass it on to the next one.\r\n                            16:25\r\n                            This is a summary of the miracle in one page.\r\n                            16:31\r\n                            And when you look on the back, under other features of the miracle, you'll see that the first verse is 19 letters, the number of Suras is 114, 19 times 6.\r\n                            16:39\r\n                            Is this simple enough? The first verse is 19 letters. The number of Suras is a multiple of 19.\r\n                            16:47\r\n                            The first revelation was 19 words. The last revelation 19 words.\r\n                            16:52\r\n                            These are famous first revelations and famous last revelations. And they are very simple. They don't require a computer.\r\n                            17:00\r\n                            But not a single person outside the fold of believers was allowed to touch it.\r\n                            17:08\r\n                            It's a monopoly. You look at the people who made the major discoveries, Abdullah, Mahmoud, Ihsan, Lisa, many others, Feroz, Ismail\r\n                            17:22\r\n                            These are the people that we know. They are all, Gatut, all people who firmly believe like we do.\r\n                            17:32\r\n                            And for a long time I was surprised, why doesn't anybody else find these things, you know? Because I needed some support.\r\n                            17:39\r\n                            It's very simple. When you look at the back, you'll see how simple it is.\r\n                            17:45\r\n                            From the missing BISMILLAH to the extra BISMILLAH, 19 Suras. Is this difficult? I mean, the consistency and repetition of the number 19 is so simple.\r\n                            17:56\r\n                            Yet, nobody, there are a billion Muslims in the world, but none of them was allowed to\r\n                            18:04\r\n                            find these very simple facts unless they have heard the Quran alone.\r\n                            18:12\r\n                            If they believed in Hadith and Sunnah and mentioned other names in their prayer,\r\n                            18:18\r\n                            they are not permitted to touch it. This is verse 77.\r\n                            18:25\r\n                            By the way, on the front, you see a very complex miracle. In the circle, this was... it's no longer the biggest number in the world, because this is already obsolete.\r\n                            18:39\r\n                            Abdullah on his birthday, yesterday, made it obsolete. In that circle, the number begins with the first verse in the Quran, 1.\r\n                            18:48\r\n                            So, if you look on the left, there is an asterisk on the left side of the circle.\r\n                            18:53\r\n                            And you see, right, we start by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. These are the verses of the first Sura, 7 verses.\r\n                            19:00\r\n                            Followed by the total number of verses in the Sura, which is 7. Then you move on to the next Sura, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, all the way to 286,\r\n                            19:09\r\n                            the number of verses in Sura 2. Then you put the total number of verses in Sura two, 286. And you do this all the way to the end of the Quran.\r\n                            19:17\r\n                            When you get to the end of the Quran, if you look on the right side, you see this big arrow that says total number of verses in the Quran. You put that.\r\n                            19:24\r\n                            Now, you have a very long number, that is, I like it in the metric system, it's one kilometer long.\r\n                            19:31\r\n                            And it consists of 12,696 digits. And it is a multiple of 19.\r\n                            19:38\r\n                            If you go on, if you see now, if you look on the right side of the circle, in the middle of it,\r\n                            19:45\r\n                            with the big arrow that says total number of verses in the Quran, after the asterisk comes the total number of verses in the first Sura, which is 7.\r\n                            19:53\r\n                            And next to it, the 7 verses, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Then, you put the total number of verses in Sura number 2, and so on.\r\n                            20:02\r\n                            So, what we're doing in the lower half is we are reversing the position of the total number of verses. Instead putting it at the end of every Sura, we are putting it at the\r\n                            20:10\r\n                            beginning of every Sura. And brothers and sisters, the number is divisible when you go to the end.\r\n                            20:16\r\n                            So now, this is a circle, and connect the two numbers, you have what was, until\r\n                            20:22\r\n                            yesterday, the day before yesterday, the longest number in the world, 25,388 digits.\r\n                            20:29\r\n                            And that's a multiple of 19. Now, what Abdullah did to make this number obsolete, he added the number of every Sura.\r\n                            20:38\r\n                            Okay, let's go now to the asterisk on the left side of the circle.\r\n                            20:43\r\n                            It begins with the numbers of the verses of the first Sura, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, followed by the total number of verses in this Sura, which is 7.\r\n                            20:52\r\n                            Now, between the two 7s there, he put the number of the Sura, 1. And he did this with every Sura, and you guessed it, the number is still divisible.\r\n                            21:02\r\n                            It's just incredible. And there is more. If you put the number of the Sura at the beginning, or at the end, or in the middle,\r\n                            21:11\r\n                            it's still divisible. So, this will be in the Ramadan issue. In the Muslim perspective, you're gonna get more details.\r\n                            21:22\r\n                            So now, I don't know how many digits there are from the first Sura to the last Sura, the numbers.\r\n                            21:28\r\n                            1, 2, 3, 4, you counted the digits. 114, from the Sura 1, Sura 2, Sura 3, Sura 4, all the way to Sura 114.\r\n                            21:37\r\n                            Do you know how many digits?\r\n                            21:44\r\n                            474. You add that. A man: Why are you adding 1 and 2 and 3 up to 114?\r\n                            21:56\r\n                            The messenger: That's because you put them next to each other, not adding This, this is a by-the-way miracle.\r\n                            22:03\r\n                            1, 2, 3, 4 all the way to the end of the Quran, 114. We're putting the digits next to each other.\r\n                            22:09\r\n                            474 digits and it's a multiple of 19. So, you put that, you add this to this number which is 25,696. You add 474. Now, we have the biggest number in the world.\r\n                            22:23\r\n                            And it is out of this Quran. 2, 4, 25, 3, 88, plus 4 is 70\r\n                            22:31\r\n                            So, it's about 25,800 numbers, digits.\r\n                            22:36\r\n                            That is divisible. A woman: Can you put it through at the beginning or at the end, or in the middle?\r\n                            22:41\r\n                            The messenger: In the middle, meaning between the last verse and the total number of verses. If you look on the left side of the circle, you see the asterisk.\r\n                            22:49\r\n                            And above it, you see the number of verses in Sura Al-Fãtehah, number 1. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\r\n                            22:56\r\n                            Followed by the total number of verses in the Sura, which is another 7. So, if you put the 1 between the two 7s that you see there, that's the number of the Sura,\r\n                            23:05\r\n                            And you do this in all the Suras, it's divisible. If you move the number of the Sura and put it at the beginning, so you have 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7\r\n                            23:13\r\n                            That's divisible. And if you put the total number of verses at the beginning, so you have 1, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\r\n                            23:19\r\n                            You still have a divisible number. So, it sounds like almost a physical impossibility, but it locks every verse.\r\n                            23:31\r\n                            Somebody called today and said, how do you know it's only the two verses in Sura 9? If you notice that Sura 9 is mentioned here.\r\n                            23:39\r\n                            If you look at the upper right corner of the circle, it says \"total number of verses in Sura 9.\" You have to use 127.\r\n                            23:46\r\n                            This fellow was calling from Louisville, Kentucky, and he said \"how do you know it's only the two verses in Sura 9 that violate the code?\"\r\n                            23:53\r\n                            So, I told him, because every single verse, what we see here is every single verse in the Quran is authenticated as Divine from God.\r\n                            24:01\r\n                            Every single one, except these two. So, it is fitting to mention why God swears by the position of the stars that this is a Quran KARIM.\r\n                            24:19\r\n                            By the way, Al-Quran Al-Karim has a numerical value that's 684, a multiple of 19.\r\n                            24:24\r\n                            The numerical value of this, the official name of the Quran, Al-Quran Al-Karim.\r\n                            24:32\r\n                            Just to change the subject and make it a little bit light-footed. Do you know how they count the stars?\r\n                            24:37\r\n                            I'm sure some of you do. But anyway, they go out in the night and take a picture of the sky.\r\n                            24:42\r\n                            They just take a picture. They put it in a computer, and the computer will count the number of stars in that area, in that picture.\r\n                            24:51\r\n                            And there's a formula that tells you what the circumference from the inside of a circle is.\r\n                            24:57\r\n                            And then you can tell from this picture how many are in the whole circumference of the whole sky.\r\n                            25:06\r\n                            And you do this a hundred times, and then you take the average of the hundred times, and you have exactly, almost exactly, the number of stars, A billion trillion of them.\r\n                            25:16\r\n                            And these are the ones that we see. Because of this, if our Sun is in the next galaxy, we will not be able to see it, because it is one of the dim stars.\r\n                            25:27\r\n                            What you see are only the bright stars.\r\n                            25:32\r\n                            This is how we counted them. [56:75] I swear by the positions of the stars.\r\n                            25:38\r\n                            Because they are in perfect position, in perfect orbits. They don't crash into one another.\r\n                            25:52\r\n                            There was something else, I also wanted to mention here.\r\n                            26:01\r\n                            I think this is it. Are there any questions?\r\n                            26:07\r\n                            A man: I'm not sure. If you have two numbers, what is the quantity of (unintelligible)?\r\n                            26:18\r\n                            The messenger: Yes.\r\n                            26:27\r\n                            Right, right. We have two halves that are divisible by 19. So, what I'm doing here is just making them into a circle.\r\n                            26:34\r\n                            Well, the upper half is a multiple of 19, and you have the total number of verses at the end of each Sura.\r\n                            26:42\r\n                            The lower half is a multiple of 19, and the connecting them has nothing to do with anything.\r\n                            26:48\r\n                            But in the lower half, you have the number of verses at the beginning of every Sura. If you look on the right side of the circle, look at the right side of the circle at the\r\n                            26:57\r\n                            big arrow that says total number of verses in the Quran. Below that, you see Sura Al-Fãtehah with the total number of verses, which is 7, at the beginning, not at the end.\r\n                            27:06\r\n                            So, you have 7,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 instead of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7.\r\n                            27:14\r\n                            Both of them are independently divisible by 19. I just put them next to each other.\r\n                            27:23\r\n                            And it's because the upper half was a discovery by Feroz Karmally in Canada.\r\n                            27:29\r\n                            And he ended up putting the total number of verses in the Quran at the end of the number.\r\n                            27:37\r\n                            The lower half is Abdullah's discovery, and the total number of verses comes ahead of the Sura.\r\n                            27:44\r\n                            So, the total number of verses in the Quran fits right there ahead of the whole Quran.\r\n                            27:52\r\n                            So I put it in a circle. This circle is now obsolete. Great, but obsolete. We have better circles now.\r\n                            28:03\r\n                            Lisa: It's a sphere. The messenger: Any other questions? The messenger: Ok. Back to Lisa and verse number what?\r\n                            28:10\r\n                            Lisa: Verse number 88.\r\n                            28:16\r\n                            [56:88] [thereafter] If he is one of those close to Me— [56:89] then [happiness], flowers, and gardens of bliss.\r\n                            28:22\r\n                            [56:90] And if he [belongs with those on] the right— [56:91] [then] peace [to you from] those on the right.\r\n                            28:28\r\n                            [56:92] But if he is one of the [rejecters], the strayers— [56:93] then an abode of [retribution]— [56:94] and burning in Hell.\r\n                            28:35\r\n                            [56:95] This is the [inevitable] truth. [56:96] You shall glorify the name of your Lord, the Great.\r\n                            28:44\r\n                            Verse 88 and 89, actually all of these verses refer back to the beginning verses of this\r\n                            28:53\r\n                            Quran, of this Sura, where it talks about the High Heaven, the Lower Heaven, and Hell.\r\n                            28:59\r\n                            And we see again in 88 how beautiful the Highest Heaven is. We know, of course, that these are all allegorical descriptions, that God uses allegory because\r\n                            29:09\r\n                            there is no way that we, in our present states, can even begin to understand really what is in store for us.\r\n                            29:16\r\n                            But we know from the allegory of the Highest Heaven that it is truly bliss.\r\n                            29:24\r\n                            And that it is wonderful beyond our dreams. God says that anything we wish for, anything those who are in the Highest Heaven, IN SHAA ALLAH we'll be there, anything they wish for and even more.\r\n                            29:38\r\n                            So, God's grace is even greater than anything we can comprehend or desire, wish for.\r\n                            29:48\r\n                            And then those on the right, those in Lower Heaven, for them also it's incredibly beautiful.\r\n                            29:58\r\n                            And it's peace. [56:91] peace [to you from] those on the right.\r\n                            30:04\r\n                            An incredible, incredible triumph to be among those on the right.\r\n                            30:09\r\n                            [56:92] But if he is one of the [rejectors], the strayers— [56:93] then an abode of inferno— [56:94] and burning in Hell.\r\n                            30:20\r\n                            We know, again, that we can't comprehend really the awfulness of Hell.\r\n                            30:28\r\n                            We have a slight idea because we are as far from God as anything in the universe at this point.\r\n                            30:36\r\n                            And we know how hellish this world is and how awful it is, particularly when you step out of God's Kingdom.\r\n                            30:42\r\n                            We're incredibly blessed to be in God's Kingdom, IN SHAA ALLAH But as soon as you step out, you know what an incredible hell that is.\r\n                            30:52\r\n                            And that is nothing compared to the ultimate Hell.\r\n                            31:00\r\n                            [56:95] This is the [inevitable] truth. [56:96] You shall glorify the name of your Lord, the Great.\r\n                            31:08\r\n                            Mã Shã Allãh Are there any comments or questions on these last verses?\r\n                            31:17\r\n                            This was so beautifully discussed earlier, last week and the week before, because we've had those verses before.\r\n                            31:27\r\n                            The messenger: Yes, yes, go ahead. Who's next? A woman: I was just so particularly impressed by the ending, the way you end it beautifully.\r\n                            People who die before 40yrs.\r\n                            31:40\r\n                            The messenger: The verses 88 and 89 refer to you, to special people.\r\n                            31:47\r\n                            And I say this with thanking God and God says \"speak up of God's blessings on you.\" You're a very rare, fortunate and blessed group of people.\r\n                            31:57\r\n                            And 90 refers to all the people who died before the age of 40.\r\n                            32:05\r\n                            It says [56:90] And if he [belongs with those on] the right—\r\n                            32:12\r\n                            Those people will be very happy because they will go to the Lower Heaven.\r\n                            32:20\r\n                            God knew that they deserve, they do not deserve to go to Hell, they deserve to go to the Lower Heaven\r\n                            32:26\r\n                            because of circumstances that only He knows. That's why He took them at that... they were children that came here to perform a function.\r\n                            32:36\r\n                            They were assigned souls that God knows deserve to go to the Lower Heaven.\r\n                            32:41\r\n                            Well, they lived until the age of 39 or just before 40, when God takes them at that time\r\n                            32:47\r\n                            because had they lived, they would have been swept by circumstances.\r\n                            32:56\r\n                            Which brings me to a point that I will be talking about, IN SHAA ALLAH, in the Khutba two weeks from today, IN SHAA ALLAH.\r\n                            33:06\r\n                            Where very quickly, IBRAHIM, God says \"we granted Abraham his understanding, for we were fully aware of him.\"\r\n                            33:16\r\n                            This verse tells you it was not Abraham's intelligence that led him to discover God.\r\n                            33:21\r\n                            God granted him the understanding, because God knew that Abraham deserved to go to the High Heaven.\r\n                            33:30\r\n                            And the other verse that I wish to share with you is Joseph, when Joseph almost fell for the governor's wife.\r\n                            33:37\r\n                            And then God said \"if it were not that he saw a sign from his Lord\", then God says \"we thus divert sin from him.\"\r\n                            33:45\r\n                            So, was it Joseph who was so great that he didn't fall in sin, or was it God that protected him from sin?\r\n                            33:51\r\n                            It was God that protected him from sin. By the way, the verse goes on and says إِنَّهُۥ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا ٱلْمُخْلَصِينَ (12:24) that he was one of our devoted servants.\r\n                            Believers who were “swept in the crowd.”\r\n                            34:00\r\n                            Because he was one of God's devoted servants, God diverted him from, protected him from sin.\r\n                            34:07\r\n                            So, what I'm saying is that when we agreed with Satan billions of years ago,\r\n                            34:16\r\n                            some of us were swept in the crowd. And God knew that.\r\n                            34:21\r\n                            This is what God meant when He said to the angels, the angels said \"put them all in Hell.\" And God said \"I know what you do not know.\"\r\n                            34:29\r\n                            So, God knows that we were swept in the crowd, some of us were swept in the crowd, and do not deserve to go to Hell.\r\n                            34:37\r\n                            This is why God granted Abraham his understanding. God granted you the fortune to come across the true message, to worship Him alone and upholding His word alone.\r\n                            34:50\r\n                            It's not because you're clever, or because I'm smart. It's because apparently God, not apparently, obviously, God knew that some of us were swept\r\n                            35:01\r\n                            in the crowd somehow, and we agreed with Satan, and we deserve the chance to come here to be redeemed.\r\n                            35:11\r\n                            So, the people who are taken, like Martin Luther King, taken only a few months before his 40th birthday.\r\n                            35:18\r\n                            Malcolm X, being taken two months before his birthday, his 40th birthday.\r\n                            35:23\r\n                            And all the other signs that we have seen. In fact, if you look at verse 41, where you're holding the book now, you see 41 is the beginning of Hell.\r\n                            35:34\r\n                            So, those of you who make the decision, if you look at the previous Sura, verse 41,\r\n                            35:40\r\n                            we know from this circle here that these numbers of verses are designed, divinely designed for a reason.\r\n                            35:49\r\n                            And we have all these mathematical proofs. Once you get into the age of 41, you better be worshipping God alone.\r\n                            36:00\r\n                            Just a second. I don't wanna forget what I'm saying. So, had God left Martin Luther King to live beyond the age of 40, he would have been swept,\r\n                            36:10\r\n                            that's the word that brought me to Khutba two weeks from now. Whether being swept by his environment and his circumstances into, maybe, mentioning Jesus and things like that,\r\n                            36:19\r\n                            for so long he was a pastor in a church, I think, but in his heart, and even vocally,\r\n                            36:26\r\n                            he never said anything about Jesus. Not that I heard of, in his vast amount of recordings, he always talked about God.\r\n                            36:34\r\n                            So, this is why God chose to take him, at that time, to protect him from going beyond\r\n                            36:42\r\n                            to this number 41, and be swept by his environment and his circumstances into Christianity.\r\n                            36:50\r\n                            So, it will be like we see here on verse 90, [56:90] And if he [belongs with those on] the right— [56:91] [then] peace [to you from] those on the right.\r\n                            36:59\r\n                            And you can be sure that God's justice put these people exactly in the right place.\r\n                            37:04\r\n                            He deserves to be in the Lower Heaven. When Satan made that blasphemy billions of years ago, there were degrees of convictions among us\r\n                            37:16\r\n                            to go from the jinns who completely agreed with Satan, to the majority of humans who\r\n                            37:21\r\n                            were wishy-washy, to some who were swept in the crowd. And hopefully that's us.\r\n                            37:30\r\n                            So, now Kathy has a question.\r\n                            37:37\r\n                            Kathy: And I want to go to the earlier verses, I have a question about the conversation from the entire Heaven. It's obvious we are the later generation now.\r\n                            37:47\r\n                            The messenger: We are the first generation. Kathy: Ok. The messenger: You were not here last week, were you? That's what you get for missing a Friday.\r\n                            37:59\r\n                            Kathy: I had one or two episodes. The messenger: I was just explaining to you why you missed that.\r\n                            Description of “special” and “first generation” Believers.\r\n                            38:07\r\n                            Kathy: Is there going to be another two generations from this generation or two generations, the higher generation here?\r\n                            38:21\r\n                            The messenger: OK, you're talking about the very special group of people who will be in the closet to God on the Day of Judgment and they are very special people.\r\n                            38:30\r\n                            And this will be like when the Prophet Muhammad started to preach... Well, let's go to Abraham. Abraham started Islam.\r\n                            38:41\r\n                            And then there were people who were with him when the others would throw him in the fire.\r\n                            38:47\r\n                            And then by the time the Prophet Muhammad came, they became idol worshippers. Then, the message was renewed by revealing the Quran through the Prophet Muhammad.\r\n                            38:55\r\n                            And he was secretly preaching. And there were people with him. Those are very special people. This is the first generation.\r\n                            39:02\r\n                            And then Muhammad became victorious and he opened Mecca and all the people in Mecca became believers.\r\n                            39:07\r\n                            They jumped in the wagon. But they do not deserve the same credit as the people who were with him when he was being\r\n                            39:13\r\n                            persecuted and having stones thrown at him and he was cast and called names and persecuted.\r\n                            39:22\r\n                            Does this make sense? So that was a first generation at the time of Abraham, at the time of Muhammad.\r\n                            39:29\r\n                            And then ten years ago, Islam was totally corrupted. There is not a single mosque in the world that upholds the commandment to mention only\r\n                            39:38\r\n                            the name of God in the mosque, in the worship practices and so on.\r\n                            39:43\r\n                            And then God renewed the message with this miracle. So, now we are a first generation.\r\n                            39:50\r\n                            And the people who are in this movement, while it is being persecuted and the names and the\r\n                            39:56\r\n                            insults and so on, are very special people. Now, ten years from now, we will probably have millions, maybe twenty years, fifty years from now.\r\n                            40:04\r\n                            And everybody will jump in the wagon, but they do not deserve the same credit as you do. So, these very special people will be multitudes from this generation.\r\n                            40:13\r\n                            After that, when it is famous and successful and it is the thing to do, they don't deserve the same credit. They will not be in the same rank.\r\n                            40:23\r\n                            This is what we did last week when you were absent.\r\n                            40:30\r\n                            Any questions? A man: The thing between age 40 and the stuff that is related to the messenger being at age 40. The messenger: No.\r\n                            40:40\r\n                            The messenger: We don't even know if he was really 40 or not. They didn't have birth certificates then. They're just guessing that the Prophet was 40 when he was awakened and given the Quran. But it has nothing to do with that.\r\n                            40:52\r\n                            It is in the Quran, in Sura 46, verse 15, it says...it's what it says. It's based on that.\r\n                            41:01\r\n                            Any other questions? We're back to Lisa and Sura 57.\r\n                            41:10\r\n                            Lisa: بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.\r\n                            41:17\r\n                            [57:1] Glorifying GOD is everything in the heavens and the earth. He is the Almighty, Most Wise.\r\n                            41:24\r\n                            Everything glorifies God, whether willingly or unwillingly, because God controls every minute atom and subatomic particle in the universe.\r\n                            41:36\r\n                            So, physically everything glorifies God. And everything glorifies God mentally except the human beings, who are absolute idiots.\r\n                            41:47\r\n                            We are the only ones who chose, who accepted the freedom of choice.\r\n                            41:53\r\n                            And so even our bodies glorify God, but unless we make the conscious choice of worshipping God alone\r\n                            42:02\r\n                            and accepting and realizing His awesome omnipotence and all of His incredible qualities, we do not... our minds do not glorify God.\r\n                            42:18\r\n                            [57:2] To Him belongs the [dominion] of the heavens and the earth. He controls life and death. He is Omnipotent.\r\n                            42:26\r\n                            And yet there are those of us who do not glorify Him. [57:3] He is the [First and the Last]. He is the Outermost and the Innermost. He is fully aware of all things.\r\n                            42:38\r\n                            [57:4] He is the One who created the heavens and the earth in six days,* then assumed all authority. He knows everything that enters into the earth, and everything that comes out of it, and everything that [descends] from the sky, and everything that [ascends] into it. He is with you wherever you may be. GOD is Seer of everything you do.\r\n                            43:00\r\n                            He truly is in absolute control of the universes.\r\n                            43:07\r\n                            This verse to me expresses it very, very clearly and very, very beautifully.\r\n                            43:15\r\n                            Verse 5, [57:5] To Him belongs the [dominions] of the heavens and the earth. [God is in full control of all things].\r\n                            43:23\r\n                            These verses again and again are saying absolutely what we've been saying, that God does everything.\r\n                            43:31\r\n                            And yet it is so hard for us to accept that. I mean, you can hear it and you can say \"yes\", but then, you know, you get sidetracked.\r\n                            43:43\r\n                            \"Oh, if I don't take my vitamins, I'm gonna get sick.\" You aren't gonna get sick unless you deserve to get sick.\r\n                            43:51\r\n                            That doesn't mean you shouldn't take your vitamins, because God has given us the vitamins, given us the medicine.\r\n                            43:58\r\n                            But we have to remember that God is the One who is controlling everything, who is doing everything.\r\n                            44:04\r\n                            God controls our bosses. God controls our neighbors. God controls our spouses. He controls not only the physical things,\r\n                            44:12\r\n                            He controls the emotions, the hearts and the minds of those around us and of us.\r\n                            44:18\r\n                            As Rashad pointed out so beautifully, God bestowed on Abraham his righteousness, his understanding.\r\n                            44:25\r\n                            Well, God says very clearly that He bestows on all of us our righteousness. It's not us. It's not ours.\r\n                            44:31\r\n                            We, you know, God gives it to us. He controls our hearts and our minds if we make that one choice. The only thing we really control is that one choice of whether we worship God alone or not.\r\n                            44:45\r\n                            Once we've made that decision, He goes from there. He takes it from there. And there are a lot of verses that talk about God misguiding those who disbelieve.\r\n                            44:56\r\n                            Well, they've made that choice to disbelieve, and He helps them along in that choice.\r\n                            45:01\r\n                            Those who believe, He helps them along in that choice. And each and every one of us, I know, have experienced that very thing of God giving us strong signs. We've made a decision.\r\n                            45:13\r\n                            Okay, we've repented. We've made a decision. And suddenly, God, I mean, just showers us with strong reassurance.\r\n                            45:23\r\n                            It's there because we made the choice, but God is the One who's giving it to us.\r\n                            45:29\r\n                            All we can really do is to make that choice. A man: I was wondering if God grants righteousness after we've passed the test, and become a little bit more enduring, or what?\r\n                            45:48\r\n                            I know like prophet Joseph was a man, and Joseph said on his deathbed, he said \"Thank God, I've granted righteousness\" to contribute to his success.\r\n                            Submission nursery rhymes – singing with children.\r\n                            46:09\r\n                            The messenger: This helps.\r\n                            46:16\r\n                            A woman and a group of children: As each little rabbit had each last bag, remembering God should be first on our mind.\r\n                            46:28\r\n                            We know that everywhere our eyes can see, there are God's creation and signs to observe.\r\n                            46:39\r\n                            So, when you see a flower, say \"Mã Shã Allãh.\"\r\n                            46:45\r\n                            You want something tomorrow, say \"IN SHAA ALLAH.\" Before you start at anything, say \"Bismillah.\"\r\n                            46:53\r\n                            In everything you try to think, say \"Alhamdu Lillah.\"\r\n                            47:00\r\n                            Think of God as you go through each day, appreciate His power, His mercy and grace.\r\n                            47:08\r\n                            We must remember God, so God remembers us. Every moment that you can, remember God, remember God.\r\n                            47:20\r\n                            And when you see a flower, say \"Mã Shã Allãh.\"\r\n                            47:25\r\n                            You want something tomorrow, say \"IN SHAA ALLAH.\" Before you start at anything, say \"Bismillah.\"\r\n                            47:34\r\n                            In everything you try to think, say \"Alhamdu Lillah.\" When you see a flower, say \"Mã Shã Allãh.\"\r\n                            47:42\r\n                            You want something tomorrow, say \"IN SHAA ALLAH.\" Before you start at anything, say \"Bismillah.\"\r\n                            47:52\r\n                            In everything you try to think, say \"Alhamdu Lillah.\"\r\n                            48:23\r\n                            The messenger: Is that it? I missed the beginning of it, I want you to do it again from the beginning.\r\n                            48:38\r\n                            A woman: Can you guys sing a little louder?\r\n                            48:47\r\n                            A woman and a group of children: As each little rabbit had each last bag, remembering God should be first on our mind.\r\n                            48:57\r\n                            We know that everywhere our eyes can see, there are God's creation and signs to observe.\r\n                            49:07\r\n                            So, when you see a flower, say \"Mã Shã Allãh.\"\r\n                            49:12\r\n                            You want something tomorrow, say \"IN SHAA ALLAH.\" Before you start at anything, say \"Bismillah.\"\r\n                            49:21\r\n                            In everything you try to think, say \"Alhamdu Lillah.\"\r\n                            49:27\r\n                            Think of God as you go through each day, appreciate His power, His mercy and grace.\r\n                            49:36\r\n                            We must remember God, so God remembers us.

So, in verse 5, it goes along with that idea.\r\n                            0:14\r\n                            Whatever you do, as long as you submit it to God, you're doing what God wants you to do.\r\n                            0:25\r\n                            Okay, and God doesn't even allow the disbelievers to do things that He doesn't will.\r\n                            0:34\r\n                            He's in control of the actions of the disbelievers, too.\r\n                            0:45\r\n                            One of the ways He does that is that He sends angels to protect the believers from the disbelievers' actions.\r\n                            0:53\r\n                            Okay, so if He knows that something needs to be protected, He'll send angels, and it says that in verse 6.\r\n                            1:04\r\n                            Then, we go on to verse 7. [59:7] Whatever GOD restored to His messenger from the (defeated) communities shall go to GOD and His messenger (in the form of a charity). You shall give it to the relatives, the orphans, the poor, and the traveling alien. Thus, it will not remain monopolized by the strong among you. You may keep the spoils given to you by the messenger, but do not take what he enjoins you from taking. You shall reverence GOD. GOD is strict in enforcing retribution.\r\n                            1:36\r\n                            [59:8] (You shall give) to the needy who immigrated. They were evicted from their homes and deprived of their properties, because they sought GOD's grace and pleasure, and because they supported GOD and His messenger. They are the truthful.\r\n                            1:49\r\n                            Okay. I'll stop there. What shifts the gears again. We read about the spoils of war and how we shouldn't... the spoils of war shouldn't be given to the rich to make them richer and more powerful, you know.\r\n                            2:08\r\n                            There are people that need things, and they should be given to them so that, you know, it could be fair.\r\n                            2:15\r\n                            It's... you know, I think about, like in World War II again, how Hitler and all the people, they were taking all the riches from the places that they invaded.\r\n                            2:30\r\n                            And, you know, the rich got richer and more powerful, and, you know, the poor were left on their own.\r\n                            2:42\r\n                            And God is most fair, and so He says \"give it to the poor and those who need it.\"\r\n                            2:54\r\n                            Are there any comments on this page so far? The messenger: Okay, let me comment here on this Exodus.\r\n                            “invisible giant” protects you, example given wars during the days of Prophet Mohammad also XRAYS, UV and infrared given as examples of invisible forces.\r\n                            3:03\r\n                            Okay, we hear over and over again, God is telling us that He controls the minds and the hearts\r\n                            3:09\r\n                            of every single creature, every single ant, every single elephant, every single human being on earth.\r\n                            3:17\r\n                            And over and over again, He's telling you that you have an invisible giant standing\r\n                            3:23\r\n                            by you to protect you as one of God's people. There's an invisible giant standing, going wherever your children go, anything connected with you.\r\n                            3:36\r\n                            When you go take a test, there's an angel with you, an invisible giant. And they know everything about nuclear physics, mathematics, geography, psychology.\r\n                            3:46\r\n                            And they deal with your kids. Here we have an example of the enemies of the...\r\n                            3:54\r\n                            The believers were overwhelmed. They were a small minority, and all the tribes banded together to finish Islam once and for all.\r\n                            4:01\r\n                            And finish Muhammad, and finish all the people who believed with him. And they were a very small minority.\r\n                            4:07\r\n                            The armies were huge. Now, these are all the tribes of Arabia, united, to wipe out Islam once and for all.\r\n                            4:17\r\n                            And they went around Medina. And they had allies inside the city, in the hearts of the, among the believers.\r\n                            4:26\r\n                            But they couldn't do it. There's no way they can do it. God puts terror in their hearts, and you just hear Exodus, they just left their homes on their own accord.\r\n                            4:36\r\n                            They were terrified, because it's not them. It's not up to them.\r\n                            4:43\r\n                            So, they had to leave their homes on their own. They left their lands, their homes, their properties, and they just fled.\r\n                            4:52\r\n                            The believers didn't do anything. They didn't need to. And if you recall from Sura 33, the battle of the Partisans, the angels took care of\r\n                            5:01\r\n                            all those parties that were surrounding Medina to finish Islam, and the Prophet, and the Muslims, once and for all.\r\n                            5:07\r\n                            Violent wind blew them away, literally blew them away. And they had to leave.\r\n                            5:14\r\n                            And this is, you read in the Quran consistently, that God's system does not change.\r\n                            5:21\r\n                            There's an invisible giant standing by you to protect you, to serve you, to tell you \"I'm your friend.\"\r\n                            5:28\r\n                            And to go with your children wherever they go.\r\n                            5:33\r\n                            You have grown up girls, don't think they are not chaperones, they are chaperones. They are protectors.\r\n                            5:39\r\n                            You don't have to worry about a single one of them. And this is no longer just a bunch of talk.\r\n                            5:47\r\n                            We have here, in this mosque, we have a track record, right here. And we've seen examples. We've seen both sides of the coin.\r\n                            5:55\r\n                            So, we know what we're talking about. I mean, we are living the Quran.\r\n                            6:04\r\n                            Even if God did not decree exodus for them, He would have punished them in this life anyway.\r\n                            6:11\r\n                            Because those who sided against God, they just have no chance. The Quran repeatedly says \"do not be impressed by their apparent successes, their apparent temporary successes.\r\n                            6:24\r\n                            Their very success becomes the source of their misery in this world. They're not happy. Do not be impressed by their apparent successes if they are successful.\r\n                            6:38\r\n                            So, I hope I'm impressing on you enough that you have confidence in God that He is sending His forces with you.\r\n                            6:46\r\n                            The Quran consistently talks about invisible soldiers. These invisible soldiers, they are with the believers.\r\n                            6:56\r\n                            And the problem with those people out there in the street, they don't believe in the invisible. They only believe in the visible.\r\n                            7:01\r\n                            And our visible range is very limited, by the way. In fact, this light, the visible range, there are only seven colors? Seven colors in the visible range.\r\n                            7:11\r\n                            And it's a very narrow range. Beyond that, we don't see. And there are things that we know exist. The X-rays exists. The ultraviolet exists.\r\n                            7:22\r\n                            Ultra is on one end, and the X-rays is on the other end. No, excuse me, they're both on the same end, but the X-rays are shorter than UV. Infrared is on the other side. You do not see the infrared.\r\n                            7:40\r\n                            We were talking about the infrared one time, and we said \"you can take a picture of that couch after David and Frank leave, and you'll see them there, after they leave.\"\r\n                            7:49\r\n                            And if one of them punches the other in the face, we'll know who punched who. After they leave, because of the infrared.\r\n                            7:58\r\n                            But the UV and X-rays are invisible. UV is what hits you when you sit in the sun too long.\r\n                            8:05\r\n                            And we're all aware of the X-rays. We don't see them, but they are powerful.\r\n                            8:12\r\n                            So, this is just a tiny sample of the invisibles. You have an invisible giant standing by you.\r\n                            8:20\r\n                            If somebody comes to punch you on the nose, you can imagine what will happen to them. Unless you deserve it. Then, the punch will come through. Measured.\r\n                            Spoils of war – abused Verse 59:7, Sects of Islam.\r\n                            8:41\r\n                            The spoils of war. Of course, only the strong, young, powerful, able will go to war, and they will get spoils of war.\r\n                            8:50\r\n                            So, God is saying, to be fair and distribute them at least one-fifth of them must go out.\r\n                            8:59\r\n                            In the Shia sect, they take advantage of this one-fifth business.\r\n                            9:04\r\n                            And it is common in the Shia village that a man with a black turban will go to the house\r\n                            9:10\r\n                            and say \"give me one-fifth of everything you own. I'm a descendant of the Prophet.\" And they would give him one-fifth of everything they own. This is what some people told me.\r\n                            9:23\r\n                            خمس they call it. One-fifth. So, it is a misinterpretation of this law for abuse.\r\n                            9:34\r\n                            One of the most abused verses in the Quran is verse 7, where it says, whatever\r\n                            9:42\r\n                            the Messenger gives you, you shall take, and whatever he forbids you, do not take.\r\n                            9:47\r\n                            It has to do with the spoils of war, but they make it to mean Hadith and Sunnah.\r\n                            9:55\r\n                            So, there is abuse in all the sects of Islam, so-called sects. Of course, in Sura 6, verse 159, it says \"If you divide yourself into sects, you do not belong with God or with the messenger.\"\r\n                            10:09\r\n                            So, both sects, the Sunnis and the Shias, are not Muslims. By their own admission. You ask \"what are you?\" \"I'm a Sunni.\"\r\n                            10:16\r\n                            Who's gonna say that in the Day of Judgment? \"What are you?\" \"I'm a Sunni.\" \"What are you?\" \"I'm a Shia.\"\r\n                            10:23\r\n                            You don't say Muslim. So, both of them abuse these verses in this particular Sura.\r\n                            10:35\r\n                            And you know something? I do go along with them. I say \"okay, what the messenger gives you, take, and what he forbids you, don't take.\r\n                            10:41\r\n                            He gave you the Quran. He uttered only the Quran. So, even though they abuse the verse, I do go along with them.\r\n                            10:53\r\n                            Are there any questions on this? Are you gonna forget that you have an invisible giant behind you?\r\n                            11:02\r\n                            And with your kids, with your affairs. Don't forget that.\r\n                            11:13\r\n                            Okay, we'll go back to verse 9, Donna\r\n                            11:19\r\n                            Donna: [59:9] As for those who provided them with a home and a refuge, and were believers before them, they love those who immigrated to them, and find no hesitation in their hearts in helping them. In fact, they readily give them priority over themselves, even when they themselves need what they give away. Indeed, those who overcome their natural stinginess are the successful ones.\r\n                            11:40\r\n                            [59:10] Those who became believers after them say, \"Our Lord, forgive us and our brethren who preceded us to the faith, and keep our hearts from harboring any hatred towards those who believed. Our Lord, You are Compassionate, Most Merciful.\"\r\n                            11:56\r\n                            Okay, these are fairly straightforward. You know, people that, when a person comes to you and they're in need, a Muslim is gonna\r\n                            12:08\r\n                            help out, you know, when you see that there's a real need, you know.\r\n                            12:14\r\n                            And they even go out of their way to help a needy person, as long as it doesn't interrupt their worshipping God alone.\r\n                            12:24\r\n                            That always comes first.\r\n                            12:31\r\n                            And then it says, the immigrants who come later, you know, they ask God to help them, well, it\r\n                            12:44\r\n                            says, forgive those who preceded them to Islam. But then it says, to remove any hatred from their heart. Ok?\r\n                            12:53\r\n                            And the believers should always hang together.\r\n                            13:00\r\n                            Okay, there was... what is it? There's a verse. I wrote it down, 3:103.\r\n                            13:11\r\n                            Sura 3, 103.\r\n                            13:19\r\n                            [3:103] You shall hold fast to the rope of GOD, all of you, and do not be divided. Recall GOD's blessings upon you—you used to be enemies and He reconciled your hearts. By His grace, you became brethren. You were at the brink of a pit of fire, and He saved you therefrom. GOD thus explains His revelations for you, that you may be guided.\r\n                            13:36\r\n                            And the believers should be united, you know, and there shouldn't be hatred.\r\n                            13:43\r\n                            And we should ask God, you know, to help us, you know, not be enemies or to remove any hatred between us.\r\n                            14:00\r\n                            Then, it goes on to verse 11. The hypocrites said to their allies...\r\n                            14:05\r\n                            The messenger: Let me give you a little rest here on these two verses, 9 and 10.\r\n                            14:15\r\n                            Yeah, I want to... this gives me a chance to thank God and be proud of something that our community has done. It's a perfect example of living the Quran. You all know Emily.\r\n                            14:27\r\n                            She works Friday nights, unfortunately, but soon God will give her time to work here. But she packed everything in New York and she moved here.\r\n                            14:36\r\n                            And she had, there was a period of time when she was looking for a job. And she had no means of support.\r\n                            14:43\r\n                            And I tell you, during all this time when she needed help, this drawer was full of envelopes with Emily's name on it.\r\n                            14:50\r\n                            People were pitching in and helping her. And she kept her on her feet until she was standing on her own feet.\r\n                            14:57\r\n                            I don't know who all those people are, but, you know, we're a small community. We're not wealthy.\r\n                            15:05\r\n                            But this drawer had enough support for Emily. There were sealed envelopes with her name on it. And I passed them on to her and that helped her.\r\n                            15:14\r\n                            Just like she didn't feel bad. But this is an example of immigrants who joined the believers.\r\n                            15:23\r\n                            And the people who are established helped them. And I know, I mean, this is not the only example. I was giving good examples.\r\n                            15:30\r\n                            This will always happen. This always happened in the past. And it happens naturally.\r\n                            15:36\r\n                            When you're a believer, God guides you into doing these things. So, I just wanted to note this.\r\n                            15:42\r\n                            And also I want to go back to the protection and give you, I think we learn best by the real-life examples of things that happened to us.\r\n                            15:53\r\n                            I'm sure Lori will not mind mentioning her accident sometime back. But this is an example of an invisible giant who is with you.\r\n                            16:02\r\n                            Lori was in an accident. She was thrown out of the car.\r\n                            16:08\r\n                            And then she took care of the driver. Her sister was driving. And her sister went to the hospital. Now, nothing happened to her.\r\n                            16:15\r\n                            She took care of her sister. Now, if you're thrown out of a car, you will hit something or something will hit you. But no, nothing.\r\n                            16:23\r\n                            I mean, you can imagine the invisible giant was carrying her outside in perfect safety.\r\n                            16:29\r\n                            And this was a nearby track record. There are many, many examples. That was one of them. Real-life examples.\r\n                            16:39\r\n                            And we thank God for teaching us the real-life and through the Quran.\r\n                            16:47\r\n                            Go ahead. A man: It says, removing our hearts from hatred toward believers. What's it saying there?\r\n                            16:59\r\n                            The messenger: Which verse is this? 10? That's for the immigrants who came later to Islam.\r\n                            God removes hatred from hearts of believers.\r\n                            17:06\r\n                            They say \"our Lord, forgive us and forgive those who preceded us to Islam. Remove from our hearts any hatred for us.\r\n                            17:13\r\n                            These were people who were fighting each other. They were trying to kill each other.\r\n                            17:19\r\n                            And then the disbelievers became believers and joined the camp of them. And these are people who killed my brother, my cousin, my father in war.\r\n                            17:29\r\n                            They were engaged in war. And now they joined. I mean, they know that this guy killed my father or this guy killed my brother.\r\n                            17:36\r\n                            And now he's a believer. And God did remove hatred from their hearts and they became like a family.\r\n                            17:44\r\n                            I mean, you have to take (unintelligible) to those days and understand what was going on. A woman: Rashad, even today, we hear so much in the news that's bad, negative about Muslims, that in this\r\n                            17:56\r\n                            culture, in this country, you can come to think of Muslims as being horrible people.\r\n                            18:02\r\n                            And then God chooses to guide you to this. Then, all of a sudden you know the difference and have that.\r\n                            18:09\r\n                            (unintelligible) But it is easy to have a wrong impression on Islam due to the so-called Muslims. The messenger: Exactly. Yes.\r\n                            18:20\r\n                            The messenger: They did a good job giving Islam a bad name. A woman: Yes. The messenger: I don't really blame the Americans.\r\n                            18:27\r\n                            Donna: But also, it doesn't have to be a deep-seated hatred. It can be just differences between people.\r\n                            18:33\r\n                            There's always gonna be differences between, well, just personalities.\r\n                            18:39\r\n                            And, you know, you've kind of gotta make compromises and so forth.\r\n                            18:45\r\n                            So, the believers are united and stay together as a family.\r\n                            18:51\r\n                            The messenger: It's a very nice prayer. (Unintelligible).\r\n                            18:58\r\n                            Donna: Okay, are we ready to go on? Okay. [59:11] Have you noted those who are plagued with hypocrisy, and how they said to their companions in disbelief among the people of the scripture, \"If you are evicted we will go out with you, and will never obey anyone who opposes you. If anyone fights you, we will fight on your side.\" GOD bears witness that they are liars.\r\n                            19:22\r\n                            [59:12] In fact, if they were evicted, they would not have gone out with them, and if anyone fought them, they would not have supported them. Even if they supported them, they would have turned around and fled. They could never win.\r\n                            19:39\r\n                            [59:13] Indeed, you strike more terror in their hearts than their fear of GOD. This is because they are people who do not comprehend.\r\n                            19:45\r\n                            [59:14] They do not get together to fight you unless they are in well-shielded buildings, or behind walls. Their might appears formidable among themselves. You would think that they are united, when in fact their hearts are divided. This is because they are people who do not understand.\r\n                            20:02\r\n                            [59:15] Their fate is the same as their counterparts who preceded them. They suffered the consequences of their decisions. They have incurred a painful retribution.\r\n                            20:11\r\n                            [59:16] They are like the devil: he says to the human being, \"Disbelieve,\" then as soon as he disbelieves, he says, \"I disown you. I fear GOD, Lord of the universe.\"\r\n                            20:20\r\n                            [59:17] The destiny for both of them is the Hellfire, wherein they abide forever. This is the requital for the transgressors.\r\n                            20:28\r\n                            I'll go back to verse 11, here. And this set of verses is talking about hypocrites and disbelievers and lump them together.\r\n                            20:38\r\n                            And the hypocrites are saying to the disbelievers \"okay. we are with you, we are with you.\" You know. And you know, \"we'll go with you.\"\r\n                            20:49\r\n                            If they do get banished, they don't go with them.\r\n                            20:54\r\n                            Hypocrites, you know, they stay in one place. They're just hypocrites. You know, that's the reason God has saved the best place in Hell for them\r\n                            21:04\r\n                            because they don't go with that group, they don't go with that group. You know, they just stay on the fence post.\r\n                            21:14\r\n                            Ok. And they fear everybody else, the hypocrites do,\r\n                            21:23\r\n                            instead of God, as they should. They are worried about what everybody else is gonna think about them, you know.\r\n                            21:32\r\n                            We wanna be with this group, but we wanna be with this group. It doesn't work that way.\r\n                            21:40\r\n                            Ok. And they won't fight. It says in verse 14, they won't fight unless they are behind some big wall, thinking that that's gonna protect them, you know.\r\n                            21:50\r\n                            And you already found out over here, in the first set of verses, that, you know, it doesn't protect you from God.\r\n                            21:57\r\n                            If God's will is for them to be destroyed, then nothing will protect them.\r\n                            22:09\r\n                            Also in this verse 14, it says you would think they were united, but in reality, they are all divided.\r\n                            22:17\r\n                            You know, it's just like the Muslims now. You think they're all one group, especially the Christians, that don't know anything about Islam. You know, they think all Muslims.\r\n                            22:27\r\n                            You know, there's a whole lot of them. There's a whole lot of them. You know, they are striking terror and everything.\r\n                            22:35\r\n                            But there is Sunnis, there is whatever.\r\n                            22:40\r\n                            I can't even think of them all. You know, even between those, they are fighting. And one guy believes something and one guy believes something else.\r\n                            22:48\r\n                            You know, and that's one reason why it's nice for the believers to be united\r\n                            22:53\r\n                            because, I mean, the way they are so divided, one united group of believers is more than this divided group and this divided group, you know.\r\n                            23:04\r\n                            It also shows their disbelief and their arrogance. They always wanna follow their own way.\r\n                            23:11\r\n                            And so, you know, it's like a two-step this morning, you know. They kick each other's butt.\r\n                            23:41\r\n                            A man: What are the causes for human being to be a hypocrite?\r\n                            23:46\r\n                            The messenger: The causes? A man: The choice, is it by himself or herself, given to him by God? Why the person chooses to be a hypocrite?\r\n                            24:12\r\n                            The messenger: Hypocrisy is lack of belief. The belief is not there.\r\n                            24:18\r\n                            And what they're doing is going along with whatever group they're with.\r\n                            24:23\r\n                            So, they're really worshipping their own ego. A man: Is it a choice that they're making on their own? The messenger: Yes, of course.\r\n                            24:31\r\n                            The messenger: It's a choice that they're making. A man: So, why some are making, some are not? Is there anything with God, or genetically or naturally or is there any second power behind their mind?\r\n                            24:46\r\n                            The messenger: It's a conclusion that they reach on their own. It's a decision they make.\r\n                            24:52\r\n                            We study our surroundings, and we look at the universe around us, and we decide to believe\r\n                            24:57\r\n                            in God, disbelieve in God, or go along with the crowd, wherever we are. So, these are the three kinds of people:\r\n                            Definition of a hypocrite.\r\n                            25:04\r\n                            believers, disbelievers, and hypocrites.\r\n                            25:14\r\n                            A man: مجاهدین المنافقین\r\n                            25:21\r\n                            The messenger: Yeah, they're called Mojahedin Khalq (مجاهدین خلق)? A man: Yeah, those are the people, they're confused. They say they are Mohajed.\r\n                            25:38\r\n                            A man: .... to the time of Muhammad...\r\n                            25:48\r\n                            A man: What are the definition of a person.... Mojahed and Munafiq?\r\n                            25:57\r\n                            The messenger: Ok. The definition of a hypocrite is one who says that he's a believer when in his or her heart are not believers.\r\n                            26:05\r\n                            They say they are believers, and usually they don't know that they're not believers.\r\n                            26:13\r\n                            So, God gives us criteria in the Quran. For example,\r\n                            26:20\r\n                            I know now for a fact that they are forbidden by God from saying \"La Elaha Ella Allah\"\r\n                            26:26\r\n                            without saying \"Muhammad Rasulallah.\" I mean, I did my own experiments.\r\n                            26:32\r\n                            I used my education to run some experiments, and I find it true.\r\n                            26:38\r\n                            I mean, the last time I challenged the person, I said \"you are forbidden by God from saying La Elaha Ella Allah.\"\r\n                            26:47\r\n                            And he could not say \"La Elaha Ella Allah\" without saying \"Muhammad Rasulallah.\" He was unable to say it.\r\n                            26:53\r\n                            So, here's a person who claims to be a believer, but he's not. So, God gives us the criteria.\r\n                            26:59\r\n                            One of them is when God alone is mentioned, they don't like it. When Muhammad is mentioned with him, or somebody else is mentioned with God, then they like it. This is in Sura 39, verse 45.\r\n                            27:10\r\n                            So, there are criteria in the Quran that will tell the person whether he or she is a believer or not.\r\n                            27:18\r\n                            So, the definition, now a disbeliever is one who says he doesn't believe. That's a disbeliever.\r\n                            27:24\r\n                            And the Quran writes about them two verses. But a hypocrite is one who says that he or she is a believer when they are not believers.\r\n                            27:33\r\n                            And this is why the Quran writes 13 verses about them.\r\n                            27:39\r\n                            Because they are more damaging than the disbelievers. The disbeliever, you know, you know the position.\r\n                            27:47\r\n                            But the hypocrite is a person who claims to be a believer. What can you do?\r\n                            28:06\r\n                            They didn't call themselves Munafiqun. They never called themselves Munafiqun.\r\n                            28:13\r\n                            There's nobody on earth who thinks that he or she is going to Hell. But we know from the Quran that the majority of people are going to Hell.\r\n                            28:26\r\n                            Hamid: Dr. Khalifa... The messenger: First, before you say anything, I confused you with Mohsen Bilyani.\r\n                            28:32\r\n                            Hamid: Oh, Really? The messenger: I called you Mohsen. I forget your name. Hamid: Because you just... it's okay if you confuse me with Mohsen.\r\n                            28:41\r\n                            The messenger: You say you and Mohsen are very close. So, well, do you wanna introduce yourself?\r\n                            28:47\r\n                            A man: Why did you come with him here? The messenger: Yeah, I know. The messenger: I just discovered recently that I confused you with Mohsen. That I called you Mohsen.\r\n                            28:56\r\n                            The messenger: But your name is? Hamid: He's not here. The messenger: Yeah, he is here. Hamid: Is he? The messenger: Yeah.\r\n                            29:02\r\n                            I just saw him the other day. This is when I said \"hey, wait a minute. This is Mohsen.\"\r\n                            29:07\r\n                            Hamid: Doctor, I'm not losing my hair. The guy doesn't have any...\r\n                            29:20\r\n                            The messenger: Give me your name first. Hamid: I'm Hamid. The messenger: Hamid, okay. The messenger: Go ahead.\r\n                            29:25\r\n                            Hamid: Now, going back to our discussion, does Quran categorize the hypocrites worse than non-believers? The messenger: Yes.\r\n                            29:35\r\n                            Hamid: Is that the reason that there are more verses about them? The messenger: Yes. The messenger: Yeah, there's a statement in Sura 4 that says the hypocrites are in the lowest pit of Hell. Hamid: Right.\r\n                            29:45\r\n                            The messenger: Now, a good example of the hypocrites, if I may say so, is Khomeini, for example. Hamid: Right.\r\n                            29:53\r\n                            The messenger: He's a person who thinks he's the leader of the Islamic revolution. Hamid: He's the biggest hypocrite of all. The messenger: Exactly.\r\n                            30:00\r\n                            The messenger: But he really, he believes, he sincerely believes that he is a believer. But he doesn't act according to the Quran. Hamid: You know what?\r\n                            30:10\r\n                            The messenger: Go ahead. Hamid: Basically, my brother was mentioning about what was going on in Iran. They use it in their own benefit. And I think the line is very fine line.\r\n                            30:30\r\n                            It's sometimes even confusing for the ordinary people to really recognize that, you know, who is who, and which is which.\r\n                            30:41\r\n                            And that makes it a little bit, unfortunately, hard.\r\n                            30:47\r\n                            Sometimes very painful and costly, like what we are witnessing in the case of, you know, what they offer.\r\n                            31:36\r\n                            The messenger: No, the Quran definitely says that the hypocrites are worse in the lowest pit of Hell.\r\n                            31:42\r\n                            Cause here, I mean, before the whole world, the whole world looks at them as Muslims. They're acting in the name of Islam.\r\n                            31:49\r\n                            I mean, the last four weeks, they executed 400 people in Iran because of drugs, supposedly.\r\n                            31:56\r\n                            Hamid: Yesterday, according to BBC, 85 people, yesterday alone was executed The messenger: Yes. This makes it 400 in 4 weeks. Now, the trial takes one week.\r\n                            32:06\r\n                            And, I mean, they don't, maybe some of these people are insane. Maybe they have pain and they need to take drugs. Actually, they don't even take drugs. This is the name of Islam.\r\n                            32:16\r\n                            Parivash: No, I had a letter from my mom. And she said that was the worst. And the drug dealer, they were anywhere. They saw them in any street anywhere.\r\n                            32:28\r\n                            And they were so scared because they had young kids. And they were so scared because of this.\r\n                            32:34\r\n                            And they don't like somebody was killed because of that. But I had another letter. They said \"yeah, when they killed some of these, at least they can't see it anywhere, these drug dealers.\"\r\n                            32:48\r\n                            And that's because we are here. We don't know. That's what my mom doesn't, she's not in this, any politics or anything of this.\r\n                            32:56\r\n                            That was the letter I have from her. And we don't, we are here. And we don't know what's going over there. If they keep, the drug is over there because of this situation.\r\n                            Drug addicts and dealers – Quran does not advocate the killing of them.\r\n                            33:05\r\n                            Because the young people, they don't have anything over there. And the drug is all over there in the country. And this is easy.\r\n                            33:15\r\n                            When you wanna buy a drug, it's cheaper than if you buy a cigarette, a pack of cigarettes.\r\n                            33:21\r\n                            The messenger: You're talking about hashish? Parivash: No, heroin. The messenger: Heroin. Parivash: Yeah, that's the worst thing. When you can buy it, cheaper than that...\r\n                            33:31\r\n                            The messenger: It's all over the place. Parivash: Yeah, it's all over the place. The messenger: But who said that drug addicts or drug dealers should be killed? Parivash: That is not from the Islam.\r\n                            33:41\r\n                            Parivash: They do it because they want to save...I don't know. I am not talking about... The messenger: To save the country. Praivash: To save the country.\r\n                            33:47\r\n                            The messenger: The country needs to be saved from them. Parivash: I don't know. That is not something...\r\n                            33:57\r\n                            When you are living over there, you have kids. You wanna protect them. The messenger: Yes.\r\n                            34:03\r\n                            The messenger: From heroin? Parivash: Yeah, this is one of the worst things, I think. Hamid: Well, ironically, you have written... I'm sorry, I just don't wanna interrupt you. This business actually may be a waster of time for some other person The messenger: No, no, go ahead.\r\n                            34:20\r\n                            Hamid: But the situation is really worsening every day. And we hear, here, also.\r\n                            34:27\r\n                            We know Iran is going through its darkest period right at this time.\r\n                            34:33\r\n                            And hopefully we will come out of it, IN SHAA ALLAH The messenger: IN SHAA ALLAH. Hamid: But It was even mentioned in one of the regime's newspapers that one family sold their daughter and son in the southern part of Iran next to Pakistan.\r\n                            34:50\r\n                            He sold, because he was addicted to heroin, he sold his daughter for 35,000 Toman and\r\n                            35:00\r\n                            for his son 35,000 Toman and his daughter for 5,000 Toman which is probably like $250\r\n                            35:08\r\n                            to $200 just to give an app.\r\n                            35:17\r\n                            The messenger: This is a regime newspaper. I don't know if I believe it or not. Hamid: Well, I'm saying once in a while they can't even...It is happening. This is one man from a hundred. But, you know, they can't really deny the whole thing.\r\n                            35:36\r\n                            They try to minimize it, but it is really... The messenger: It's a mess anyway. Hamid: It is so a mess\r\n                            35:41\r\n                            even the United States told its allies not to give this government the money that they wanted. But it is very unstable.\r\n                            35:56\r\n                            The messenger: Maybe this proceeds true Islam. True Islam will come to Iran, IN SHAA ALLAH.\r\n                            36:01\r\n                            Hamid: And one more, just a second. 10% of the population will be addicted to drugs. 5 million, according to the United States.\r\n                            36:12\r\n                            The messenger: They're addicted to drugs? Hamid: 10% of the whole population. The whole country.\r\n                            36:21\r\n                            The messenger: Well, I don't know. A woman: 10% of the young people, not the old people. This is the whole thing.\r\n                            36:26\r\n                            The messenger: Well, 10 or 15% of the Egyptians have been smoking hashish for the last three years.\r\n                            36:33\r\n                            The messenger: And nothing has happened to them. This is their problem. A man: Why is nothing happening to them? The messenger: Right.\r\n                            36:41\r\n                            The messenger: Okay, back to Donna and verse 12. Donna: 13 Donna: Well, I'd like to point out that we refer to verse 16 where it says that Satan says\r\n                            36:50\r\n                            \"disbelieve\" and then he says, when, you know, then when the person disbelieves, he says \"okay, you know, I fear God myself, you know.\"\r\n                            37:02\r\n                            I don't have anything to do with you, you know. A man: Bye. Donna: And it's a very strong verse. I would like to point that out. And we refer to it quite often.\r\n                            37:14\r\n                            Satan himself knows who really controls things, and he fears himself. Okay.\r\n                            37:22\r\n                            And on to verse 18. [59:18] O you who believe, you shall reverence GOD, and let every soul examine what it has sent ahead for tomorrow. You shall reverence GOD; GOD is fully Cognizant of everything you do.\r\n                            37:34\r\n                            [59:19] Do not be like those who forgot GOD, so He made them forget themselves. These are the wicked.\r\n                            37:42\r\n                            [59:20] Not equal are the dwellers of the Hellfire and the dwellers of Paradise; the dwellers of Paradise are the winners.\r\n                            37:52\r\n                            Okay. As Muslims, even on a daily basis or even every hour or moment, every time you can remember,\r\n                            38:04\r\n                            think about what we're doing, you know. Make sure that it's what God wants, you know.\r\n                            38:11\r\n                            And make sure that we're on the right track.\r\n                            38:18\r\n                            And our prayers help us do that, you know. By praying, we get back on the right track and back to thinking about God.\r\n                            38:27\r\n                            It keeps us from falling into sin. And then in verse 19, it says \"Do not be like those who forgot God.\"\r\n                            38:40\r\n                            There's a verse in the (unintelligible) that we say all the time, you know \"remember God so that He may remember you.\"\r\n                            38:46\r\n                            Well, if you forget God, it's like Abdullah was talking about one time and said \"you pick your own Lord\", you know.\r\n                            38:55\r\n                            If you pick your job or whatever is the one that you occupy your mind with the most, well, you've forgotten God.\r\n                            39:05\r\n                            You know, that job becomes your God. That's the one you worry about, think about the most.\r\n                            39:12\r\n                            And so when you think about something other than God, or I'll say \"if you occupy your mind with something other than God, then you forget to feed your own soul\", you know.\r\n                            39:30\r\n                            You aren't thinking about God so that He can help you in your daily life and you remember God.\r\n                            39:40\r\n                            It's just like an equation, you know. It's a balanced kind of equation. You remember God and He remembers you.\r\n                            39:48\r\n                            You forget God and you starve your soul and you pick some other god other than God.\r\n                            39:58\r\n                            And those that pick other gods, you know, are the losers in the Hereafter.\r\n                            40:07\r\n                            Their souls are starved and they won't be able to withstand the presence of God.\r\n                            40:16\r\n                            And only those who have fed their souls and remembered God are gonna be the winners and be strong enough to be close to God.\r\n                            40:26\r\n                            Donna: Ok. Are there any comments about those beautiful verses? The messenger: Any questions?\r\n                            40:35\r\n                            A man: Verse 18, the Lord says \"for each one who examines what he or she has advanced for the coming day\", we now understand...\r\n                            40:51\r\n                            we have to frequently examine where we stand.\r\n                            40:57\r\n                            And hopefully each day, at the end of each day, we look at what we have done, whether it's in accordance with what God has commanded us, or we've been breaking any laws,\r\n                            41:13\r\n                            so that we don't get into the wishful thinking that we believe and we'll make it. We have to examine our actions frequently and see if we're in the right path because\r\n                            41:30\r\n                            it's very easy to deviate from the right path and still think that we're being guided, but we may not be.\r\n                            41:37\r\n                            So, and God gives us how we do that, like whether what we're doing is in accordance with the Quran and this is our guidance.\r\n                            41:47\r\n                            And if we examine neutrally, what they're calling it, just look at what you've done every day or every week, then you can see whether you're on the right path.\r\n                            42:03\r\n                            But a lot of people, they say they believe and they never think what they are doing. And that's what God is saying.\r\n                            42:11\r\n                            We should examine what we see or advance for the coming days because whatever we are doing is for the Hereafter.\r\n                            42:22\r\n                            And this world is temporary and we are working for the Hereafter and we have to examine what we're doing for the Hereafter.\r\n                            42:34\r\n                            The messenger: Right. Finished? Right. A man: Yes. A man: My question was aimed to the same verse. I guess...\r\n                            42:44\r\n                            I don't know. I feel, I guess it's like, you know, where I will be faithful, you know, you can just get right on the side of it.\r\n                            Analogy of working for this life Vs. working for the Hereafter.\r\n                            43:15\r\n                            The messenger: That asking God for forgiveness in itself is an act of remembering God.\r\n                            43:20\r\n                            I want to give you an analogy from this life, okay? Just think about what David Dixon is doing to guarantee a good life between the age of, say, 30 and 65, 35 years.\r\n                            43:35\r\n                            He goes through school, and this applies to all of us, I'm just using David as an example,\r\n                            43:40\r\n                            And because he's having such rough time, it's really rough, medical school is very difficult.\r\n                            43:46\r\n                            You go to school, grade school, junior high, high school, college, examinations, tests, staying up all night, homework, and this is to prepare for 35 or 40 years.\r\n                            44:03\r\n                            Now, after that comes retirement, say 10, 20 years, for which people prepare their IRA, individual retirement account, and they're very worried, you know, what they will have.\r\n                            44:17\r\n                            Okay, what comes after that, after retirement? Let us say, not 40 years, let's say 40 million years. It's forever, 40 million years.\r\n                            44:27\r\n                            So, what are we doing for those 40 million years? For 40 years, you go through all this studying and homework and all this rough, you told me today it's rough, and every student now at the university knows how rough it is.\r\n                            44:44\r\n                            And this is just for 20 or 30 or 40 years. But God is telling us in this verse \"examine what you have advanced for the coming day, an eternal day.\"\r\n                            44:57\r\n                            The day of resurrection is an eternal day, 40 million years. How much are you going to need then?\r\n                            45:04\r\n                            In your 40 years here, you need, let's say $20,000 if you're really poor. $20,000 in 40 years is $800,000. This is what you need in this life.\r\n                            45:18\r\n                            And for these $800,000, you go to school and you work hard, and you're very polite to your teachers, so they give you a good grade, and they do anything they say.\r\n                            45:31\r\n                            \"Come here 3 o'clock in the morning, we're having a special class.\" Then, you go at 3 o'clock in the morning.\r\n                            45:37\r\n                            \"We're having a field trip.\" You'll go to the field trip. \"You study all night.\" You're gonna study all night.\r\n                            45:43\r\n                            You do all this for the $800,000 that you need in this world. Now for 40 million years, God told you exactly what to do for your PRA, post-retirement account.\r\n                            46:01\r\n                            You have to advance the funds for your PRA, the most important period of your life.\r\n                            46:10\r\n                            Every prayer, every Contact Prayer, God gives you, let's say, a million dollars. It's actually more than that.\r\n                            46:18\r\n                            But God puts in your account a million dollars. And every time you remember God, you make a deposit.\r\n                            46:26\r\n                            So, examine, and this verse here means you ask yourself every day \"how much does it put in my PRA account?\"\r\n                            46:35\r\n                            You must examine yourself every day, because on that day, when you wake up for the Day of Resurrection, you're gonna open your PRA book and say \"how much do I have?\"\r\n                            46:46\r\n                            That will decide what you're going to be for eternity.\r\n                            46:51\r\n                            I mean, here you go to school and you work very hard to have a nice, decent life here. You have to do the same for eternity.\r\n                            47:00\r\n                            Are you gonna have a decent life there forever? Are you going to be an honored person? Are you gonna be a humiliated person?\r\n                            47:07\r\n                            It is all in your hands. God left it up to you. You can make deposits as much as you want.\r\n                            47:15\r\n                            In this world, when you get your check, you go to the bank and you make a deposit in your savings account or your bank account.\r\n                            47:24\r\n                            And God gave you infinite amount of deposits that you can make.\r\n                            47:30\r\n                            You have the five Prayers. There's the five deposits every day that you make in your account over there.\r\n                            47:36\r\n                            And it is literally, this is what it says \"O you who believe, beware of God, and let each of you examine what he or she has advanced for the coming day.\r\n                            47:51\r\n                            How many deposits did you make today? Examine that. And then it tells you how to make the deposits.\r\n                            48:00\r\n                            You shall observe God. This is how, in the same verse. You observe God by doing the five, this is the minimum, the five daily prayers, by being honest, truthful, being kind to the people,\r\n                            48:17\r\n                            being an exemplary person. For God is cognizant of everything you do, meaning, every deposit you make is gonna be multiplied many folds\r\n                            48:34\r\n                            because you're building up interest. God's interest is very high, 7000%. That's God's interest. That's the minimum, excuse me. Because God says \"He gives even more than that.\"\r\n                            48:49\r\n                            So, the Quran puts things in perspective and makes us aware that the most important part of our life comes after death.\r\n                            49:02\r\n                            Yes, the CD (Certificate of Deposit) account, and by the way, you can draw benefits now, not you can, you have to. You draw benefits now.\r\n                            49:13\r\n                            I think Hamid missed the part about the invisible giants that we have. This is part of the benefits that you draw. Because you benefit from the account right now.\r\n                            49:25\r\n                            And 19 tells you \"do not be like those who forgot God.\" So again, it's telling you how to make deposits into your most important account, by remembering God.\r\n                            49:37\r\n                            \"Do not be like those who forget God, then He makes them forget their own souls\", meaning, they forgot to make deposits for their souls.\r\n                            49:47\r\n                            You're going to need that deposit when you get there, because you have the eternity ahead of you. And this is the only time you can make the deposits. Now is the only time.\r\n                            49:59\r\n                            Over there it's too late. If somebody opens the account and there's zero in it, you can't come back here to make deposits. This is the only time.\r\n                            50:15\r\n                            Are there any questions? The messenger: We'll go back to Donna and 21 or 20. Donna: 21. The messenger: 21.\r\n                            50:25\r\n                            Greatness of the Quran [59:21] If we revealed this Quran to a mountain, you would see it trembling, crumbling, out of reverence for GOD. We cite these examples for the people, that they may reflect.\r\n                            50:39\r\n                            [59:22] He is the One GOD; there is no other god besides Him. Knower of all secrets and declarations. He is the Most Gracious, Most Merciful.\r\n                            50:46\r\n                            [59:23] He is the One GOD; there is no other god besides Him. The King, the Most Sacred, the Peace, the Most Faithful, the Supreme, the Almighty, the Most Powerful, the Most Dignified. GOD be glorified; far above having partners.\r\n                            51:02\r\n                            [59:24] He is the One GOD; the Creator, the Initiator, the Designer. To Him belong the most beautiful names. Glorifying Him is everything in the heavens and the earth. He is the Almighty, Most Wise.\r\n                            51:19\r\n                            These verses are very strong verses, and they're my favorite verses. Me and Abdullah, we used to listen to these. We had a tape of them and we would listen to it every Ramadan.\r\n                            51:30\r\n                            These three verses always remind me of Ramadan. When we were younger and could stay up more at night, we would just listen to these. We would listen to these in the Arabic.\r\n                            51:43\r\n                            And, you know, this Quran, you know, it's the word of God, and nothing can match it. And, you know, the mountain, it does what God wants it to do.\r\n                            52:01\r\n                            And it knows who God is. It knows the power of God. And it sounds kind of silly, but we should strive to be like the mountain, you know.\r\n                            52:15\r\n                            I think about how the angels, you know, it may sound a little bit funny, but you should try to be an angel, I mean, they do what God wants them to do. They're the ones that made the right decision in the first place.\r\n                            52:28\r\n                            And they submit to God and do what God wants them to do. And you know, the mountain knows that, and angels know that. And God's trying to tell us, here, what to do, what He wants us to do.\r\n                            52:44\r\n                            He spelled it out for us through what He calls here \"examples for people that they may reflect.\" This book is a no nonsense history. It's full of examples that we should learn from, you know.\r\n                            52:57\r\n                            History is useless unless you learn from it. And God's given us a concise but exact history here, and we should learn from it, learn to be like the mountain and the angels.\r\n                            53:14\r\n                            And it says clearly here \"La Elaha Ella Allah.\" And there's nothing after it, except God's names here. And He knows all our intentions, all our secrets, all, He's all Knowing by definition, I know it.\r\n                            53:30\r\n                            And when I was going to the U, in our philosophy class, we learned that God by definition is All Knowing, and All Powerful, you know.\r\n                            53:43\r\n                            But people don't stop to think about that, you know. They don't even stop to think what God means. And so then, they get these things, well. \"We gotta help God, and we gotta do this for God\", you know.\r\n                            53:58\r\n                            God can't do it Himself, you know. But God by definition is All Knowing, and Almighty, and All Powerful, by definition alone. And then, it goes on to say He's Most Gracious, Most Merciful, you know.\r\n                            54:13\r\n                            He's given us a chance here on earth to, a second chance, you know, to do what's right, to be like the angels in the mountains, because we were so stupid in the beginning.\r\n                            54:30\r\n                            And then again, it says \"La Elaha Ella Allah.\" And then, it goes on to name God's names again. And it says \"the King.\" And in our class, we taught the kids, you know, if\r\n                            54:43\r\n                            if God is your King, then wherever you, then you're always in God's Kingdom, you know.\r\n                            54:49\r\n                            if God is your king, you know, because God is everywhere, so wherever you are is God's Kingdom, as long as God is your King. He's the Sacred, the Peace. There's no peace without God.\r\n                            55:03\r\n                            Happiness can only be achieved through God, and happiness is true peace inside. Oh, I skipped over the Sacred. He's, you know, the Highest, the Most Holy.\r\n                            55:17\r\n                            And then it says He's the Faithful, and if you turn to Sura 2, verse 186, it's a section on Ramadan, again.\r\n                            55:33\r\n                            It says \"and when My servants ask you about Me, I am always near. I respond to the call of any caller who calls on Me. Therefore, they shall respond to Me, and believe in Me, that they may attain guidance.\"\r\n                            55:48\r\n                            God's always there when we need Him, you know. And, you know, He's just there to help us all the time. He's the Supreme. He's the Best, the Almighty, the Powerful, by definition, you know, and the Dignified.\r\n                            56:08\r\n                            We're told in the Quran that in the Hereafter, we'll be humble, because we're nothing compared to God, you know.\r\n                            56:15\r\n                            All dignity belongs to God. And we're nothing. We're dust particles and less than dust particles in comparison to God.\r\n                            56:28\r\n                            God be glorified over and above anything they idolize. And we went over these verses with the kids tonight, and we were talking about how there's, whatever is good here on earth, whatever is,\r\n                            56:40\r\n                            you might say something that is terrific or the best or something, God is always better, you know. God is always the Greatest. He's always a step above anything here we have on earth.\r\n                            56:53\r\n                            So, anything that you idolize here on earth, God is always better than that, you know.\r\n                            56:58\r\n                            I mean, like I just said, we're all only dust particles and everything here on earth, it's just nothing also. So, God has to be greater because He controls it all.\r\n                            57:11\r\n                            He's the one God, the Creator, the Initiator, the Designer, and it doesn't miss words here, it doesn't say that He was the Constructor, you know, the Quran is very precise here.\r\n                            57:24\r\n                            All God had to say was \"be\", and He initiated the creation. His design, you know, He designed it, and all He had to say was \"be\", and it was. And to God belongs the most beautiful names,\r\n                            57:41\r\n                            A lot of these names, a lot of Christians and Muslims both put to their idols, like,\r\n                            57:48\r\n                            I know for example, it's not here, but some people call Jesus the healer. Now, you would say\r\n                            57:58\r\n                            \"no, Jesus isn't the healer.\" And they'll \"ah\", you know. They'll go into convulsion or something, you know.\r\n                            58:04\r\n                            But you say \"God isn't the Healer\" and \"okay, well, we accept that\", you know.\r\n                            58:10\r\n                            They are insulted by this, like Gatut was saying today in the Khutbah, you know,\r\n                            58:20\r\n                            \"they aren't insulted when you lessen God, you know, but you lessen their idols, and that's not to be.\"\r\n                            58:31\r\n                            Yeah. Then, it uses the same phrase here \"glorifying Him is everything in the heavens and the earth. He is the Almighty, the Wise.\" It's the same phrase here at the beginning of the Sura.\r\n                            58:51\r\n                            And I know I always think \"well, the disbelievers, do they glorify God?\" You know, and I got to thinking about that this week, and, you know, they glorify God\r\n                            59:03\r\n                            in making this come true, because their actions and everything show the believers that this is the truth, you know. You sit here and you read about the hypocrites and their allies, the disbelievers and so forth, and they say, you know, \"that's those people.\"\r\n                            59:18\r\n                            And so, they show the glory of God by showing that His words are true here, you know, in the Quran.\r\n                            59:29\r\n                            Are there any more comments? The messenger: I meant to tell you to take two Suras, but I forgot.\r\n                            59:35\r\n                            Donna: Yeah, you did, but there's not much time to go. The messenger: I'm gonna stop here. It's Ok. God bless you. You did a very good job.\r\n                            59:41\r\n                            Abdullah. Abudullah: Is this (unintelligible) and (unintelligible) Did you take all the Suras up to this point, all the Suras in the rest of the Quran?\r\n                            1:00:12\r\n                            If you take this side, to the left side, you add them all the verse numbers and chapter numbers,\r\n                            1:00:19\r\n                            they are divisible, and if you take the rest of the Quran, you add the chapter numbers and verse numbers, they are divisible.\r\n                            1:00:30\r\n                            It even mathematically designed\r\n                            1:00:35\r\n                            The messenger: This is why the mountains will crumble.\r\n                            1:00:41\r\n                            Abdullah: If you take all the verse numbers, with the chapter numbers, you add them up, I can't remember the numbers now, it's divisible.\r\n                            1:00:52\r\n                            You know, if you come to, all the way from the beginning of Quran to the verse 21,\r\n                            1:01:01\r\n                            then if you take the next following 61 and all the rest of the Quran, you do the same thing, it's divisible.\r\n                            1:01:11\r\n                            A man: Add them all? Abdullah: Add them all with the chapter numbers.\r\n                            1:01:18\r\n                            The messenger: I just want you to reflect with me on the Designer, something we take for granted.\r\n                            1:01:24\r\n                            See, now I'm scratching her ear, and when she did this, in the process, you just look at the design of the arm.\r\n                            1:01:32\r\n                            You can take your arm like this to your ear, and then you go like this.\r\n                            1:01:38\r\n                            How did God design this? It's a very important thing, you know. She did this without even thinking. But it's quite a design.\r\n                            1:01:46\r\n                            Now, more complicated are your teeth. How are your teeth fitting together? The upper and the lower, how are they fitting together?\r\n                            1:01:54\r\n                            Perfectly. You did something wrong, Hamid.\r\n                            1:02:01\r\n                            There are cutters in the front. You have these cutters in the front. And the eyeteeth, it's very important also, so you can pull on the stick if it is tough.\r\n                            1:02:14\r\n                            And then back there are the molars that grind. They're flat, and they fit in each other perfectly. Every hole or cavity has something on the other side, unless you take too much sugar.\r\n                            1:02:26\r\n                            But the two jaws are fitting together perfectly, except Hamid.\r\n                            1:02:32\r\n                            You know, we take our fingers, who designed the nails? What are these nails for?\r\n                            1:02:38\r\n                            Very simple things, and they keep growing and you keep cutting them, and they keep growing. God's design, the Designer.\r\n                            1:02:46\r\n                            Why two eyes, two kidneys? One mouth and two ears, which means shut up and listen.\r\n                            1:03:00\r\n                            God is teaching us to listen a lot, not to talk too much, because we get in trouble.\r\n                            1:03:08\r\n                            One mouth and two ears, there's a message there. This is the design. Okay, well, we thank Donna for her good job. Next time will be three Suras.\r\n                            1:03:22\r\n                            And today, tomorrow starts the spring, today started the spring break at the university.\r\n                            1:03:29\r\n                            And I know that my daughter will miss homework, so she's gonna be our teacher next week. She's gonna do homework.\r\n                            1:03:38\r\n                            Suras 60, 61, and 62.\r\n                            1:03:45\r\n                            So, she'll be our teacher next Friday. Three Suras, because we don't wanna take just one Sura every time, or it will take forever.\r\n                            1:03:57\r\n                            And, Robert? Robert: This goes back to the verse on when we were talking about the hypocrites, and it says in the Quran that they are the ones who disbelieve and believe, disbelieve and believe, and then\r\n                            1:04:13\r\n                            fall deeper into disbelief, and they are the ones who...\r\n                            1:04:20\r\n                            The messenger: No, these... Robert: They're with one side, they're with the other, and they go with one side and with the other. They're the people that never make up their minds. They want this and they want that.\r\n                            1:04:30\r\n                            And in terms of us, when we make our covenant, like the hypocrite never knows they're a hypocrite.\r\n                            1:04:37\r\n                            The disbeliever never knows they're a disbeliever. Okay, so everybody, when it came right down to it, nobody thinks they're going to Hell.\r\n                            1:04:46\r\n                            So, when you look at this, like you said \"Ayatollah Khomeini thinks... or he's a hypocrite.\" But yet, because he thinks he's a believer, but then, again, the Christians... That's bad to say that.\r\n                            1:05:03\r\n                            Certain Christians, or some Christians... The messenger: Actually, it's common to all human being. Robert: I don't wanna generalize, because you get in trouble if you do something like that. But saying certain people... Okay, if somebody idolizes Jesus, that's the best way to say it, then that person\r\n                            1:05:19\r\n                            may well think they are a believer, is an idolater. Okay, even that's where that makes them a disbeliever. Would that also make them a hypocrite? Well, no.\r\n                            1:05:29\r\n                            The messenger: Yes, he's a hypocrite because he thinks he's a believer and he thinks he's going to Heaven.\r\n                            1:05:34\r\n                            Robert: But nobody thinks they're going to Hell. The messenger: Well, the disbeliever just doesn't even think... he thinks Hell doesn't exist, you see.\r\n                            1:05:43\r\n                            But the hypocrite says he believes in God, and he knows there's Heaven and there's Hell. And he knows he's going to Heaven.\r\n                            1:05:50\r\n                            Robert: Well, then in that case, the only people who would be a disbeliever would be some atheists. The messenger: Yes, exactly.\r\n                            1:05:55\r\n                            Robert: So then, all people are hypocrites? The messenger: Yes. The vast majority are. Yes.\r\n                            1:06:05\r\n                            The messenger: That's why in Sura 12, God says \"Most people, no matter what you do, will not believe.\r\n                            1:06:12\r\n                            And then, most of those who believe will fall in idol worship.\r\n                            1:06:19\r\n                            So, the vast majority are hypocrites.\r\n                            1:06:25\r\n                            A man: My question does not relate to what was discussed. The messenger: It's okay.\r\n                            1:06:31\r\n                            A man: In Sura 53, in the footnote, the cross says (unintelligible) of Muhammad. Quran (unintelligible). And it says that Muhammad was unconscious, when he was (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:06:53\r\n                            The messenger: No, that's wrong. This is what is written in the history books. But it is not true. I don't believe it.\r\n                            Explanation\\History of written Quran.\r\n                            1:07:11\r\n                            The messenger: Muhammad was very much conscious, and he wrote the Quran with his own hand. These are things that we didn't know at the time of making this translation.\r\n                            1:07:21\r\n                            A man: Then, (unintelligible) from the new Quran. Those verses that (unintelligible). What was the reason for gathering Ayahs, and having every Ayah to be verified?\r\n                            1:07:41\r\n                            The messenger: No, no, no, that didn't happen either. This is what they said. This is what they wrote in their books.\r\n                            1:07:47\r\n                            According to them, they collected the Quran, and they had every verse witnessed by at least two witnesses,\r\n                            1:07:55\r\n                            except the last two verses in Sura 9. They found it only with a late Muslim, Medinan Muslim.\r\n                            1:08:02\r\n                            And then the Hadith supported him by saying that his testimony equals two. And this is all nonsense, of course. This is the idea.\r\n                            1:08:11\r\n                            But the Quran was written by the Prophet, with his own hand, and the instructions were on the side as to where every piece goes.\r\n                            1:08:19\r\n                            And the committee that was putting the Quran together during Uthman's time were using that. They didn't need any witnesses.\r\n                            1:08:26\r\n                            But I'm narrating what they wrote in Bukhari and the Sunnah books and all that, because it's a bunch of nonsense.\r\n                            1:08:32\r\n                            A man: Then was that being used as an evidence that the two verses were doubtful?\r\n                            1:08:40\r\n                            The messenger: Right, because, you know, the thief feels something and exposes himself.\r\n                            1:08:47\r\n                            A man: But if that was nonsense, then how could that be used as an evidence?\r\n                            1:08:53\r\n                            The messenger: Because it indicates that they were suspicious of their own crime. They knew their crime. You know, there is a famous story in the Middle East.\r\n                            1:09:03\r\n                            I don't know if it is also known in Iran or not, but this king or something, one of his precious birds was stolen.\r\n                            1:09:13\r\n                            So, he got all his servants and he lined them up in a line. And he said \"I want the person who stole my precious bird to come forward and confess, and I will forgive that person. I'll forgive him.\"\r\n                            1:09:26\r\n                            Nobody came forward. So, he kept saying \"I know who the person is, but if he comes forward, I'll forgive him. I want him to confess on his own and bring my precious bird back.\"\r\n                            1:09:37\r\n                            Nobody came forward. Then he said \"you see, I know because that person has a feather on his head.\" So, one of them went like this.\r\n                            1:09:45\r\n                            So the guilty person always exposes himself in this manner.\r\n                            1:09:56\r\n                            And they made up these stories reflecting their suspicions of the two verses. So, I reported them as it is written in Bukhari.\r\n                            1:10:09\r\n                            Maybe, I should point out that the fact is... A man: Yeah, it doesn't say that. The messenger: Okay. Good point.\r\n                            1:10:20\r\n                            The messenger: Any other questions? Okay, we're gonna wish Matt a happy birthday. His birthday was Wednesday. We're gonna pray to God to give him the happiest year of his life coming up, and every year after that to be even better.\r\n                            1:10:35\r\n                            And as you recite, turn to God and ask Him to fulfill your dearest wishes. Al-Fãtehah\r\n                            1:10:41\r\n                            Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem (1:1) Al hamdu Lillahi Rabbil ‘Alameen (1:2) Arrahman Arraheem (1:3) Maliki Yawm Eddeen (1:4) Eyyaka Na’abudu Wa Eyyaka Nasta’aeen (1:5) Ehdina Al-Serata Al-Mustaqeem (1:6) Serata Al-Lazeena An’amta ‘Alayhim Ghayri Al-Maghdoobi ‘Alayhim Wa Laddaalleen (1:7)\r\n                            1:11:00\r\n                            The messenger: Congratulations. You just deposited 10 billion dollars in your PRA account, no kidding.\r\n                            1:11:08\r\n                            You're all worth it.\r\n                            \r\n                            07 Quran Study From Azhar 7 Sura 62 & Sura 63 By Kathryn God's Religion Will Dominate In 20 To 50 Yr\r\n                            \r\n                            The messenger: I think I need to start by making a momentous announcement.\r\n                            0:08\r\n                            As you know, the true Quran, the pure Quran, never existed in the past.\r\n                            0:19\r\n                            The Prophet Muhammad received the Quran and wrote it with his own hand. And the last Sura revealed, Sura number 110, was revealed in his Hajj pilgrimage\r\n                            0:36\r\n                            only a few months before he died. The last Sura revealed in Medina was Sura number 9.\r\n                            0:46\r\n                            So, the Prophet had the Quran written with his own hand in the chronological sequence,\r\n                            0:54\r\n                            with instructions on the side saying where every piece goes. That's all the Prophet had.\r\n                            1:01\r\n                            It was not the Quran that God intended for the world. 19 years later, during the era of Uthman, Islam had gone to Syria, and Iraq, and Egypt,\r\n                            1:16\r\n                            and Uthman wanted to make copies to send to those new Muslims in new countries.\r\n                            1:23\r\n                            So, he appointed a committee to carry out the Prophet's, God's instructions, to take that\r\n                            1:32\r\n                            original copy. By that time, it was with the Prophet's wife, Hafsa, Omar's daughter.\r\n                            1:40\r\n                            Uthman sent for it, and he gave it to the committee to carry out the instructions.\r\n                            1:45\r\n                            This piece goes here, this piece goes here. And put the Quran in the order that God intends for the world.\r\n                            1:53\r\n                            And I think you know the rest of the story where, when they finished, and they came to\r\n                            2:00\r\n                            the last Sura revealed in Medina, Sura 9, someone suggested to add a couple of verses\r\n                            2:05\r\n                            to honor the Prophet. So, they committed that big crime that caused the war between Ali and Uthman, and then the\r\n                            2:17\r\n                            war against Ali and his family, the Prophet's family, that ended with the eradication of\r\n                            2:24\r\n                            the Prophet's family in Karbala. And the winners were the Umayyads who put the two verses in the Quran.\r\n                            2:36\r\n                            So, the version that came to us about the war and the history of the Quran is the version of those so-called winners.\r\n                            2:45\r\n                            They thought they won the war. So, the announcement I want to make is that this is the last time we use this.\r\n                            2:54\r\n                            As of next week, we'll use the new translation. This is the announcement.\r\n                            2:59\r\n                            So, it will not be in the book form yet, but you will be handed the new translation to study.\r\n                            3:07\r\n                            This is the last time we use this. It's a historical day. But the new translation is gonna come out. It's gonna be hardcover. It's gonna be luxurious.\r\n                            3:17\r\n                            You see the page there? This is a very hazy cover. It's not a good one.\r\n                            3:23\r\n                            But it's gonna be sharp and it will be in gold stamp. The cover itself, the hardcover outside will be dark blue.\r\n                            3:34\r\n                            And it will be, for the first time in history, the pure Quran, in Arabic and in English.\r\n                            3:42\r\n                            So, as you know, some of you read the small booklet about the two verses. And...\r\n                            4:01\r\n                            I mentioned many of the reasons why God did not let those people have the pure Quran,\r\n                            4:07\r\n                            because they simply did not deserve it. Because only 19 years after the Prophet's death, they corrupted the religion.\r\n                            4:14\r\n                            They started to worship Muhammad against his will, in the same way the Christians do with Jesus.\r\n                            4:22\r\n                            They're all humans. The Christians are humans and the Muslims are humans, and both of them fell for the trap\r\n                            4:27\r\n                            of Satan, and they started to idolize the Prophet against his will.\r\n                            4:32\r\n                            They invented an Azan that has... does not have the name of God alone.\r\n                            4:39\r\n                            The Prayer became distorted and did not have the name of God alone. And just to make a long story short, they did not deserve the pure Quran.\r\n                            4:48\r\n                            Now, there are people who devote their worship to God alone, and they uphold the Quran alone,\r\n                            4:54\r\n                            and these are the true Muslims. The true Muslims will have the true Quran. And this is really a historical event.\r\n                            5:05\r\n                            As you know, the famous statement in the Quran is that the month of Ramadan is when the Quran was revealed.\r\n                            5:15\r\n                            And this is exactly when the Quran is going to be completed and will be purified.\r\n                            5:21\r\n                            And it's gonna come out, gonna be sent to the press in Ramadan, IN SHAA ALLAH. And I know you believe me when I tell you that I didn't plan it this way.\r\n                            5:31\r\n                            It was not planned this way. As a matter of fact, I was slowed down so many times, I was frustrated due to my ignorance.\r\n                            5:38\r\n                            I shouldn't be frustrated. You should know that God is arranging the time.\r\n                            5:43\r\n                            And all these delays were designed so that the pure Quran would come out in Ramadan.\r\n                            5:52\r\n                            So I'm glad to share this with you. Now, we go to our teacher, Catherine, and we'll start at Sura 62.\r\n                            6:03\r\n                            Catherine: We're on page 397. بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ\r\n                            6:10\r\n                            [62:1] Glorifying GOD is everything in the heavens and everything on earth; the King, the Most Sacred, the Almighty, the Most Wise.\r\n                            6:18\r\n                            [62:2] He is the One who sent to the gentiles a messenger from among them, to recite to them His revelations, purify them, and teach them the scripture and wisdom. Before this, they had gone far astray.\r\n                            6:29\r\n                            [62:3] And to many generations subsequent to them. He is the Almighty, Most Wise. [62:4] Such is GOD's grace that He bestows upon whomever He wills. GOD is Possessor of Infinite Grace.\r\n                            6:41\r\n                            [62:5] The example of those who were given the Torah then failed to uphold it is like the donkey carrying great works of literature. Miserable indeed is the example of people who rejected GOD's revelations. GOD does not guide the wicked people.\r\n                            6:57\r\n                            [62:6] Say, \"O you who are Jewish, if you claim that you are GOD's chosen, to the exclusion of all other people, then you should long for death if you are truthful!\"\r\n                            7:06\r\n                            [62:7] They will never long for it, because of what they have committed. GOD is fully aware of the wicked.\r\n                            7:13\r\n                            [62:8] Say, \"The death that you are trying to evade will catch up with you sooner or later. Then you will be returned to the Knower of all secrets and declarations, then He will inform you of everything you had done.\"\r\n                            7:26\r\n                            [62:1] Glorifying GOD is everything in the heavens and everything on earth; the King, the Most Sacred, the Almighty, the Most Wise.\r\n                            7:35\r\n                            If we take that thought through all of our day, God will be our god all day long.\r\n                            7:41\r\n                            Because everywhere we look and everything we do, everything we hear, everything we see,\r\n                            7:47\r\n                            is submitting to God, including our bodies, our minds, and our hearts.\r\n                            7:56\r\n                            Donna said recently that we should strive to be like the animals and the rocks and the mountains and the trees. And when she said that, I agreed with her.\r\n                            8:09\r\n                            This is gonna sound funny. I've always been fascinated by rocks, mountains.\r\n                            8:16\r\n                            And when I was in Ireland, Alhamdu Lillah, for a short period of time, I was fascinated even more because the people live on a rock.\r\n                            8:24\r\n                            They have to carry dirt and put it between rock crevices to grow food, and then it blows away and they have to repeat the process again.\r\n                            8:31\r\n                            The rocks remain and the people go. They've worked out a compromise with God, as it were, and they have in the example of\r\n                            8:40\r\n                            the rocks around them, the mountains and the boulders, what they should be striving to be like,\r\n                            8:46\r\n                            yet steadfast as the rocks and the trees and the animals that never change. The messenger: Do you have a pet rock?\r\n                            8:52\r\n                            Catherine: No.\r\n                            8:58\r\n                            They're all pet rocks. I thought it was gonna sound funny.\r\n                            9:03\r\n                            It's part of the reason that I'm comfortable in Tucson, too. I have to say that. And green things and all living things.\r\n                            9:11\r\n                            We have so many reminders around us that there's no way that we could ever say that we did not know that there was one God and that all things submitted to God.\r\n                            9:22\r\n                            [62:2] He is the One who sent to the gentiles a messenger from among them, to recite to them His revelations, purify them, and teach them the scripture and wisdom. Before this, they had gone far astray.\r\n                            9:30\r\n                            This is incredible mercy from God. He did not have to do this for us. We blew it the first time around.\r\n                            9:36\r\n                            We just totally blew it. We missed. And this is a time when closest is only good in worship. This is a real big miss.\r\n                            9:45\r\n                            God has no reason to do anything for us. He doesn't need us for anything. He doesn't need us to know him. He doesn't need that.\r\n                            9:55\r\n                            And yet, He sends messengers, consistently sends messengers, spends 1,400 years purifying His final message.\r\n                            10:05\r\n                            He didn't have to do that. I mean, He gave it once. Why spend 1,400 years sending even more messengers and purifying the message?\r\n                            10:16\r\n                            For the very few who hear it. Incredible mercy.\r\n                            10:21\r\n                            God just did not have to do this for us. We live in a world where not too many people are given second chances.\r\n                            10:29\r\n                            You either pull your own weight or you're jettisoned like so much luggage or baggage.\r\n                            10:36\r\n                            That's not God's pattern. Not only are we given one chance, but multiple chances throughout our lives to come to the truth.\r\n                            10:43\r\n                            And so many messages and so many messengers in so many ways. The mercy that is described in the next verse as unlimited is beyond anything that we can understand.\r\n                            10:55\r\n                            We have limits. We can give people multiple chances, but at some point, we're gonna turn around and not give them another chance, and we're going to walk away.\r\n                            11:05\r\n                            But God doesn't leave that person. We do. God doesn't leave that person, or us in those times.\r\n                            11:14\r\n                            We cannot imagine what unlimited grace or mercy is. And I don't think we will until we die.\r\n                            11:21\r\n                            And we know the extent of Hell and Heaven and love and mercy and peace that waits for us.\r\n                            11:30\r\n                            Others among them refuse to join. This is verse 3. He is the Almighty, the Wise.\r\n                            11:35\r\n                            There's a verse and this one I do know, Lisa. It's 81:29, and you don't have to turn to it. I'll read it. It says\r\n                            11:43\r\n                            [81:29] Whatever you will is in accordance with the will of GOD, Lord of the universe.\r\n                            11:49\r\n                            For some time, the realization that whatever thoughts I had were not my own has been a mind-boggler for me.\r\n                            11:59\r\n                            The only thing I do is choose God alone. After that, this is an illusion, as I've spoken of before, including the illusion that I did something, that I thought something, that I had this idea.\r\n                            12:14\r\n                            As Rashad said \"God arranges everything, including the thoughts in our minds.\" Those of us who are going to invent some new and exciting tool to make a job easier,\r\n                            12:24\r\n                            when we do that and we discuss it with those fellow people, fellow colleagues, and say \"look what you thought of, look what I thought of, look what it will do.\"\r\n                            12:32\r\n                            Never have thought that God did that. You didn't do that. God put the thought for the invention in your mind and brought it to reality.\r\n                            12:41\r\n                            Every thought we have is in accordance with God's will, whether we are believers or not\r\n                            12:48\r\n                            God tailors each of our lives and experiences according to our original decision before we came here.\r\n                            12:54\r\n                            So that verse, which pops up as I read through so much of the Quran, is a constant reminder for me\r\n                            13:03\r\n                            that whatever I will is according to the will of God, meaning I don't do it, I don't think it.\r\n                            13:11\r\n                            [62:4] Such is GOD's grace that He bestows upon whomever He wills. GOD is Possessor of Infinite Grace.\r\n                            13:19\r\n                            [62:5] The example of those who were given the Torah then failed to uphold it I often wish when I'm talking to people that I could remember funny jokes that I've heard\r\n                            13:28\r\n                            or these really great lines from the comedies on television. There are some really funny lines, and I don't have that kind of mind.\r\n                            13:36\r\n                            This is one of those lines that I do remember from Quran. A donkey carrying great works of literature.\r\n                            13:43\r\n                            There's another verse in Quran that refers to the ugliest voice being that of the donkey,\r\n                            13:49\r\n                            which I remembered when I was reading this, I just don't know where it is.\r\n                            13:54\r\n                            The Quran is of no use to a disbeliever. It's totally sealed from them, from their understanding. They won't understand it.\r\n                            14:02\r\n                            They can read it. They can read the concrete words, and they're very simple. They're attainable and understandable by everyone.\r\n                            14:08\r\n                            And they don't see or hear what they just read. When you ask them \"what does that mean?\" Instead of ABC, you'll get some foreign language back that has no relationship to what people have read.\r\n                            14:21\r\n                            God prevents Quran and the truth from getting to those people who are not believers.\r\n                            14:30\r\n                            They are like donkeys carrying great works of literature. Or on the next page, where the metaphor of a wooden log is used \"Incapable of understanding.\"\r\n                            14:41\r\n                            On the other hand, a donkey submits to God totally, absolutely totally.\r\n                            14:47\r\n                            And doesn't have need of a great work of literature. The donkey's already there.\r\n                            14:53\r\n                            So, it's an interesting group of words \"A donkey carrying great works of literature.\"\r\n                            14:59\r\n                            And sometimes I feel like that. When I'm trying to work on something new or hard, or something that has been a part of me that needs to be purified, I feel like a donkey a lot of the time.\r\n                            15:10\r\n                            I don't feel like I'm going anywhere, and I'm sitting down in the middle of the road. So, this verse created a whole bunch of pictures for me when I read it. I thought it was wonderful.\r\n                            15:22\r\n                            [62:5] ... Miserable indeed is the example of people who rejected GOD's revelations. GOD does not guide the wicked people.\r\n                            15:28\r\n                            Again, whatever we will is according to the will of God. If we choose not to be guided, we won't be guided. God gives us exactly, exactly what we want.\r\n                            15:40\r\n                            We get impatient. We want it now. We want it next week. But God gives us what we need, in what form we need, when we need it,\r\n                            15:49\r\n                            including the wicked people who reject God.\r\n                            15:55\r\n                            They won't be able to say anything on the Day of Resurrection. Then, they won't have to.\r\n                            16:04\r\n                            Verse 6, [62:6] Say, \"O you who are Jewish, if you claim that you are GOD's chosen, to the exclusion of all other people, then you should long for death if you are truthful!\"\r\n                            16:11\r\n                            [62:7] They will never long for it, because of what they have committed. GOD is fully aware of the wicked.\r\n                            16:18\r\n                            You don't have to be Jewish. There are lots of people who seem to feel that they are chosen for one thing or another.\r\n                            16:27\r\n                            We all know the history of the Jewish people, but there are so many others.\r\n                            16:33\r\n                            God is aware of each and every one of them who lives their lives according to their ego\r\n                            16:38\r\n                            and their personal needs, which they focus on. And they really don't believe that God is going to do what God says.\r\n                            16:47\r\n                            That there will be a Day of Resurrection and that they will be held accountable.\r\n                            16:52\r\n                            So, for those people who put themselves above other people and those people who put themselves\r\n                            16:59\r\n                            ahead of other people, I pray to God I'm not behind them on the Day of Resurrection.\r\n                            17:07\r\n                            All of us are in the same boat. We're all responsible for our own necks, no matter whether we're Jewish, Christian, Muslim, or anything else.\r\n                            17:20\r\n                            And I'm not sure that I can say right now that I long for death. I think I need a lot more work.\r\n                            17:29\r\n                            Verse 8 says, [62:8] Say, \"The death that you are trying to evade will catch up with you sooner or later. Then you will be returned to the Knower of all secrets and declarations, then He will inform you of everything you had done.\"\r\n                            17:42\r\n                            I read a book a while ago, a long while ago, when my children were little. It was about one of those pop psychiatry kinds of things, psychology things.\r\n                            17:51\r\n                            It was about child psychology and about sibling rivalry and about children who fight with each other and drive parents crazy because they argue over everything and nothing.\r\n                            18:00\r\n                            And the only thing I got out of this hundreds of pages of book was a really cute scenario\r\n                            18:08\r\n                            about these kids squabbling in a room and the din being so loud at home And a man suggested that the parents go to the door of the room.\r\n                            18:17\r\n                            Of course, the kids would not notice that because they would be involved in their fight. And simply say, I saw that. And wait.\r\n                            18:26\r\n                            Because both children, or all children, would then turn around and look up at the parent and begin to spill out at once. Three voices at once.\r\n                            18:34\r\n                            \"What happened?\" \"He did this to me.\" \"No, he did that to me.\" And if you just waited for five minutes, you'd have the whole story.\r\n                            18:39\r\n                            And you'd be able to put it in the right order and make a judgment that would be correct.\r\n                            18:45\r\n                            And when I read this verse, \"then you will be turned over to the knower of all secrets and declarations,\" I see it like that.\r\n                            18:52\r\n                            We don't know when our death is going to come. And when it comes, the Quran tells us many of us won't even know that we've died. We'll wake and be with God. Without God.\r\n                            19:05\r\n                            And I see God standing there saying \"I saw that.\" And I don't have to say anything. Because we did that.\r\n                            19:15\r\n                            And that's not an uncomfortable feeling. That's a very comfortable feeling. To know that God is always with me.\r\n                            19:22\r\n                            That God sees my mistakes and works on me to correct those mistakes. And that the things that I may have forgotten about I'll be reminded about, hopefully in this world. And forgiven for in the next.\r\n                            19:35\r\n                            Does anybody have any comments or questions?\r\n                            Explains the term “God’s Chosen” and the misapplication of the term.\r\n                            20:12\r\n                            The messenger: Right. The messenger: See, they cut it a bit too far, God did choose them and give them the scripture, saved them from Egypt and split the sea for them.\r\n                            20:29\r\n                            So, not just they were chosen, they were God's chosen, but they made it exclusive.\r\n                            20:37\r\n                            Also they exaggerated it way beyond reason.\r\n                            20:45\r\n                            First, they were God's chosen. Then, they became almost equal to God, you know, hands around His shoulder, walk around like friends.\r\n                            20:53\r\n                            Then, God became like a child, Subhan Allah, God be glorified. In Rabbi Kushner's book, where he talks as if God is a child. He says \"it's okay, we forgive You.\"\r\n                            21:06\r\n                            Literally, I'm not exaggerating. He said \"are you ready to forgive God for what He did to you because of His inability?\" I mean, your hair will stand up if I tell you what he likes.\r\n                            21:16\r\n                            And this is, I mean, the extreme arrogance of the majority of them.\r\n                            21:22\r\n                            So, this is what happened... the distortion of the concept of being God's chosen.\r\n                            21:31\r\n                            They distorted it and exaggerated it too much.\r\n                            21:39\r\n                            We have the synagogue, they send their kids here maybe once a year to talk.\r\n                            21:47\r\n                            And one time, the sign out there was \"happiness is submission to God,\" and I was talking to those Jewish children here.\r\n                            21:56\r\n                            And I was telling them that anyone who submits to God is a submitter, regardless of the name, Jewish, Christian, Muslim, or what.\r\n                            22:05\r\n                            So, one of the teachers objected \"we do not submit to anybody.\" I said \"not even to God?\" \"Not even to God.\"\r\n                            22:13\r\n                            So, this is almost typical of the majority. It just turns out that the majority of Jews, the majority of Christians, the majority of Muslims have been tricked by Satan.\r\n                            22:24\r\n                            So, this verse here, 6, is talking about the distortion of God's choosing.\r\n                            22:32\r\n                            So, the key word would be to the exclusion of all others. And also to make it like it's guaranteed. It doesn't matter what they do.\r\n                            22:41\r\n                            This is why God says \"why don't you long for death?\" And like Catherine said \"we don't long for death because we know that the longer we worship God, the greater, the bigger, the more developed is our soul.\"\r\n                            22:53\r\n                            And also, we're not that arrogant. You have to be really arrogant to long for death.\r\n                            23:01\r\n                            But if you feel that you need to develop and grow your soul, that you need to atone for past sins, and you want to make up for the past, and things like that, you will not long for death.\r\n                            23:13\r\n                            A man: I don't think that the Jews, they are going to long...\r\n                            23:19\r\n                            The messenger: Yes.\r\n                            23:26\r\n                            The messenger: Yeah, they do.\r\n                            23:33\r\n                            The messenger: Yeah, actually a lot of them do think that automatically, you know, Muhammad will take the (unintelligible) out of them.\r\n                            23:40\r\n                            Which is a wrong concept. It's the exact opposite.\r\n                            23:51\r\n                            When you talk about sibling rivalry, I guess these people didn't know about Apamea and Naghmeh.\r\n                            24:00\r\n                            These two go to the bathroom together. Apamea: It's not me!\r\n                            24:10\r\n                            The messenger: I mean, they destroy all concepts of sibling rivalry.\r\n                            24:15\r\n                            Actually, I have noticed it with the Iranians a lot. The messenger: People from, I don't know what it is, but maybe... A woman: Not girls in general? The messenger: Not girls in general.\r\n                            24:25\r\n                            A man: Is it the same? The messenger: No.\r\n                            24:33\r\n                            I'm talking about going to the bathroom together. No rivalry, and they don't fight. A woman: They never fight?\r\n                            24:42\r\n                            The messenger: I'm just giving an example of how much we love each other. And I've seen this many times also. It's genuine. It's not only here, right? You don't act. You're like this at home, right?\r\n                            24:55\r\n                            A woman: Yes. The messenger: See. The messenger: Mã Shã Allãh\r\n                            25:04\r\n                            Any other questions? A man: It's wicked, at the end of the verse 7, therefore indicates to... On the surface, it indicates to the Jews. It refers to the verse 6.\r\n                            25:20\r\n                            But as you mentioned, there are some laws (unintelligible). Therefore it's the wicked who also in general terms (unintelligible). The messenger: Right.\r\n                            25:41\r\n                            The messenger: See, here, we don't say we're the only ones. We raise that verse in Sura 2, verse number 62, it says that anyone who worships God alone is our brother or sister.\r\n                            25:55\r\n                            Regardless of what they call themselves. Because our objective is worshiping God alone. Anyone who does that, we love them and respect them for it.\r\n                            Explains How Jews/Christians can be submitters. They must follow their religious commandments.\r\n                            26:05\r\n                            So, this is actually a very important criteria. If you go any place...\r\n                            26:11\r\n                            The messenger: Right.\r\n                            26:17\r\n                            Back to Catherine. And number 9. A man: If a person is a Christian and worships God alone, he does a certain thing that he's not supposed to do. He doesn't pray 5 times a day.\r\n                            26:32\r\n                            The messenger: No. Did he read the Quran? A man: Excuse me? The messenger: Did he read the Quran? A man: Him? The messenger: Yeah. A man: Yeah. The messenger: Well, it's alright. He goes to Heaven. It's 2:62.\r\n                            26:44\r\n                            The messenger: He worships God alone. You see, that person, if he comes across the Quran, he will agree with it, wholeheartedly. He will find nothing objectionable.\r\n                            26:54\r\n                            Absolutely. I mean, the verse 62 names Christians by name. Jews, Christians.\r\n                            27:01\r\n                            Then, it says \"anyone who worships God alone and believes in the Hereafter, the Day of Judgement, and is righteous will make it to Heaven.\"\r\n                            27:10\r\n                            The messenger: Martha. Martha: In a verse Quran says that God chose to make us in one congregation and there are different rules for different different congregations. Everyone follows their own rules. The messenger: Yes.\r\n                            27:21\r\n                            The messenger: 5:48, yes.\r\n                            27:35\r\n                            For example... I'll explain it to you. You can be a Jew if you want to and go to Heaven.\r\n                            27:41\r\n                            But if you decide to be a Jew, you have to follow the Jewish law. You have to honor the Sabbath. On Saturday, you don't work. You don't answer the telephone. You spend the day worshiping God.\r\n                            27:53\r\n                            You follow their diet system according to the Torah. You follow their laws. You pray three times a day. You do the Jewish law. You worship God alone.\r\n                            28:06\r\n                            But now that you've seen the Quran and the completion of the message, it will not be very smart to go back in time because God...\r\n                            28:13\r\n                            The scripture, the message from God, evolved with the human being.\r\n                            28:18\r\n                            But the Quran tells you that anyone who's following even one of these systems, the divinely revealed systems, it's all right.\r\n                            28:27\r\n                            A man: But didn't you mention in verse 62:7, you have to believe in the concept of Towhid and to get out? The messenger: Yes. Yes.\r\n                            28:39\r\n                            A man: As I understand the laws of Judaism, even though those who kept kosher and dairy and non-dairy and all those, Sabath and all nine yards, they don't believe in the...\r\n                            28:57\r\n                            The messenger: No, they're not Jewish then. They're just believers. A man: We are actually telling, in another word, we are telling them what the laws are. The messenger: No, the Torah, God tells them.\r\n                            29:10\r\n                            The messenger: God tells you. If they do not believe in the Hereafter, they are not following the Torah, they're not Jewish. Just like the Muslims who follow Hadith and Sunnah, they don't believe in the Hereafter according to the Quranic criteria.\r\n                            29:23\r\n                            They're not Muslims.\r\n                            29:30\r\n                            See, when I say Jewish, I mean Jewish. When I say Christian, I mean Christian. When I say Muslim, I mean Muslim. So, A Christian who does not believe in the Hereafter, Heaven and Hell, is not a Christian.\r\n                            29:42\r\n                            Because he's not following what Jesus said. And the Jew who does not believe in the Hereafter is not following the Torah, or what Moses said.\r\n                            29:50\r\n                            A man: So, you can't say what you can't guess. Christianity as defined today, you can't define Christianity as someone who follows what Jesus taught, rather than Christianity as it exists. The messenger: Well, by definition...\r\n                            30:03\r\n                            A man: Christianity, like you said, (unintelligible). Well, you can't do that because you go to church and it all operates and functions around, you know, the worship of the Trinity or God, Jesus, and the Father. The messenger: That's not Christianity.\r\n                            30:25\r\n                            A man: But as it exists today. The messenger: That's actually Paulism. A man: That's an example. The messenger: No, see, by definition, a Christian is one who follows Christ. The so-called Christianity today is really Paulism. It's not Christianity.\r\n                            30:38\r\n                            A man: Yeah, I've read that. A man: I mean, is there a Jewish Christianity in existence today? The messenger: Sure. Yeah.\r\n                            30:50\r\n                            The messenger: The Christians who do not..... The messenger: ....the messenger of God, they're Christians. Yes.\r\n                            30:55\r\n                            The messenger: Actually I... A man: In Judaism also? The messenger: Yes. They're Jews.\r\n                            No conflict with worshipping God alone under different religions.\r\n                            31:04\r\n                            The messenger: All kinds. Jews of all kind, with Orthodox Jews, Reform Jews, Conservative Jews, who are true Muslims.\r\n                            31:12\r\n                            A man: That's kind of funny, because it's all types. So you can consider everybody a true Christian, because Jesus preached to all about God. So, you can say we're Christian. The messenger: Sure. A man: So, you know....\r\n                            31:28\r\n                            The messenger: One religion. The messenger: That religion is worshipping God alone. Yes, one religion is practiced by Jews, Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists. But it is one religion.\r\n                            31:40\r\n                            A man: So, it is evolving. The messenger: Well, the message evolved with the human race.\r\n                            31:51\r\n                            The messenger: No, there's no conflict at all. If you read the Bible, the Torah, read Deuteronomy, it's beautiful. Just like the Quran. Read the Psalms. Like the Quran. Isaiah. Proverbs.\r\n                            32:07\r\n                            Read the Bible, you'll find it identical. Really, the original scripture started with the Torah.\r\n                            32:13\r\n                            Then we have, after this, the Psalms, and Isaiah, and (unintelligible), Proverbs, which is Solomon's book.\r\n                            32:23\r\n                            They're all identical to the Quran. There's no conflict at all.\r\n                            32:29\r\n                            Where is the conflict? Give me an example of conflict. Hamid: If it is more information in the Quran than what is told in the Christian Bible, it's going to be...\r\n                            32:47\r\n                            if we are saying we are stretching the knowledge to unlimited depth knowledge of the Quran, the is one criteria.\r\n                            32:59\r\n                            And the other fellow, which is the Christian, he limits it all the way to the Hebrew Bible, and ignores the rest. But you see the conflict.\r\n                            33:09\r\n                            The messenger: But that's... Where is the conflict? Do they all worship God alone?\r\n                            33:15\r\n                            Hamid: Well, at the beginning, I said, if this is more... it supersedes the other books. There has to be...\r\n                            33:32\r\n                            Hamid: I see it now. I'm sorry, I just explained it the way I could. I think there is a conflict there.\r\n                            33:40\r\n                            The messenger: Oh, Ok. There is no conflict at all. All of them advocate the worship of God alone, and all of them give you a system to develop your soul.\r\n                            33:49\r\n                            Hamid: The basics are the same. Three religions, they all worship God and God alone. The messenger: Right. That's it.\r\n                            33:56\r\n                            Hamid: But that is not enough, I think. The messenger: That's it. That's enough. It's the whole thing. Hamid: If that was enough, what was the reason of three big religions? The messenger: Because of God's mercy.\r\n                            34:12\r\n                            The messenger: It's verse two. [62:2] He is the One who sent to the gentiles a messenger from among them, to recite to them His revelations, purify them, and teach them the scripture and wisdom.\r\n                            34:23\r\n                            Gentiles are the people who did not have a scripture. God did not want to leave them alone. He didn't leave them lost. He wanted to guide them.\r\n                            34:34\r\n                            A woman: Also, God knew that the other scriptures were touched by human beings and changed, and were altered.\r\n                            34:41\r\n                            And then we got the Quran, which is never, you know, it's being, it never touches, and it's preserved.\r\n                            34:50\r\n                            And it just gave the Arabs a different set of guidelines than it gave Jews and Christians. And that's all that it is.\r\n                            34:58\r\n                            But the one that, why it came after everything else is that God knew that this one was never gonna be touched.\r\n                            God allowed previous scriptures to be altered as the Quran will dominate and remain unaltered. Islam will dominate within 50yrs from 1989.\r\n                            35:06\r\n                            The messenger: Okay. Actually, this is the chicken and the egg. God permitted the distortion of the other scriptures because this is the one that is gonna be in the whole world about 50 years from now. The others will be history.\r\n                            35:22\r\n                            But this is the only scripture, this is untouched, this is God's complete message to be given to the vast majority of the human race.\r\n                            35:30\r\n                            I mean, even 50 years from now, we'll still have 65 billion people coming to use this as their message.\r\n                            35:41\r\n                            This is God's message to come to supersede and take the place of all the others. A woman: If God didn't permit the scriptures to be such the way they were, it still preserves the correct message.\r\n                            35:54\r\n                            And it's a test for those people to get the right information out of it because some do, and some really don't see the conflict. So it's a test then. The messenger: Yeah, exactly.\r\n                            36:06\r\n                            But all those scriptures are supposed to vanish. This is why we have these overwhelming physical proofs that will simply take over the world, the whole world.\r\n                            36:19\r\n                            Just give the world 50 years from now, maybe less.\r\n                            36:31\r\n                            The messenger: This is God's law. He said We're gonna come... it would be... look at page 396, right there in front of you, verse 9.\r\n                            36:46\r\n                            [9:33] He is the One who sent His messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, and will make it dominate all religions, in spite of the idol worshipers.\r\n                            36:53\r\n                            This is God's law. This is not wishful thinking. Hamid: And it indicates this date also and saying the time, 50 years, what I'm saying is, this doesn't mention anything about 50 years.\r\n                            37:11\r\n                            Hamid: And I think it will remain with us as mankind until the end of the life, Judaism and Christianity. It has been with us and it will.\r\n                            37:35\r\n                            The messenger: Well, Islam will be the dominant, like America will be a Muslim country if you wanna look at it this way. It will no longer be a Christian, a Judeo-Christian country.\r\n                            37:45\r\n                            It will be a Muslim country. And this is God's law. The messenger: I mean, today, can you call America a Muslim country? A man: No.\r\n                            37:53\r\n                            The messenger: Okay, 50 years from now, America will be a Muslim country. And it's not wishful thinking.\r\n                            38:01\r\n                            Hamid: You are actually saying something that is based on your desire.\r\n                            38:06\r\n                            The messenger: No, it is not. Apparently, you don't know what the miracle is, so I suggest that you read the miracle of Quran and look at it carefully. Then, you will agree with me.\r\n                            38:15\r\n                            Hamid: You say 50 years? The messenger: Maximum, maximum 50 years. Probably be less than that. It'll be more like 20 years.\r\n                            38:22\r\n                            Things are gonna happen very fast in the next 20 years. But I'm giving myself a long time just to be careful.\r\n                            38:30\r\n                            The messenger: Mahmoud?\r\n                            38:45\r\n                            The messenger: Yes, yes. It's 19 x 19 x 32 The messenger: Hamid?\r\n                            38:51\r\n                            Hamid: I was just saying, in 20 years or 50 years, or whatever it is, it's an estimate that hopefully, IN SHAA ALLAH, by this time, we will realize the real message and the truth.\r\n                            39:02\r\n                            The messenger: Yes, things are gonna happen very fast, folks. Hamid: So, it is estimated then? The messenger: Like I said, 50 years is maximum. But it's most probably 20 years. In your lifetime.\r\n                            39:15\r\n                            The messenger: IN SHAA ALLAH.\r\n                            39:21\r\n                            The messenger: Hamid, do you know that the sun will rise tomorrow? Hamid: Yeah. The messenger: How? How do you know that?\r\n                            39:27\r\n                            Hamid: Because we have seen up to now that it did every day. The messenger: Right. Because there are certain signs that indicate. See, look at the clock, it is 8:15.\r\n                            39:38\r\n                            In 12 hours from now, it will be 8:15 in the morning. So, you know that the sun will come. This is a sign that the sunrise is approaching.\r\n                            39:45\r\n                            And the same with, if you read the miracle of the Quran and understand it, you'll know that this country will be Muslim within 20 to 50 years.\r\n                            39:56\r\n                            And I show you, it is God's law, I have it in front of you. 61 verse 9. This is the verse that is repeated 3 times in the Quran.\r\n                            40:06\r\n                            Back to Catherine. We've taken the whole thing from her. Verse 9.\r\n                            40:13\r\n                            Catherine: [62:9] O you who believe, when the Congregational Prayer (Salat Al-Jumu'ah) is announced on Friday, you shall hasten to the commemoration of GOD, and drop all business. This is better for you, if you only knew.\r\n                            40:23\r\n                            [62:10] Once the prayer is completed, you may spread through the land to seek GOD's bounties, and continue to remember GOD frequently, that you may succeed.\r\n                            40:32\r\n                            [62:11] When some of them come across a business deal, or some entertainment, they rush to it and leave you standing! Say, \"What GOD possesses is far better than the entertainment or the business. GOD is the best Provider.\"\r\n                            40:45\r\n                            I think most of you know that I am employed in a crisis center. And, Mã Shã Allãh, I haven't missed a Friday Jumu'ah since going to work there. Actually, that coincided with a commitment on my part not to miss.\r\n                            41:02\r\n                            And you can't organize crises. As you all know, they just kind of fall out of the sky. And every Friday, thank God, I've been able to walk out of there.\r\n                            41:13\r\n                            And no one calls me back, and the building is still standing when I get back there, and no one says anything.\r\n                            41:20\r\n                            It's very important that we understand how important it is that we come and join together on Friday. There is nothing that should keep us from that.\r\n                            41:30\r\n                            What I wrote in the margin, and I don't know when it was I wrote it, but I wrote in the margin of those three verses, illusion and unreal, and we need to leave it as easily as we turn off the television, because this is what's real.\r\n                            41:44\r\n                            Coming together at Jumu'ah and to study Quran and be with believers is real.\r\n                            41:49\r\n                            The rest of the world we live in is the illusion that God created to sustain us and guide us and teach us and extend His mercy to us.\r\n                            41:58\r\n                            But it's set up entirely for us. It's like some giant playground. Some people get injured on the playground, and some people have a wonderful time. But it is an illusion, and this is the real thing.\r\n                            42:11\r\n                            There's nothing that should keep us from this. Absolutely nothing.\r\n                            42:16\r\n                            Does anyone have any comments on the last three verses?\r\n                            42:37\r\n                            The messenger: How would you have a group of people meet in your house?\r\n                            43:08\r\n                            The messenger: What does it say? A woman: [62:9] ...when the Congregational Prayer (Salat Al-Jumu'ah) is announced on Friday, you shall hasten to the commemoration of GOD...\r\n                            43:16\r\n                            The messenger: Ok. What is Friday in Arabic? The messenger: And Jumu'ah means what?\r\n                            43:26\r\n                            The messenger: Right. A group of people\r\n                            43:33\r\n                            A woman: Even 2 people have a... The messenger: Yeah.\r\n                            43:44\r\n                            The messenger: It came from Abraham. Since the time of Abraham.\r\n                            43:52\r\n                            The messenger: Yeah. Yeah. That's what it means. What do you mean it came first? Are you talking about two things? What are the two things?\r\n                            44:07\r\n                            The messenger: Is there a first and second in your mind? I just wanna understand your question.\r\n                            44:16\r\n                            The messenger: You said \"which came first?\" What do you have in mind when you say \"which came first?\" Which and which? What and what?\r\n                            44:22\r\n                            A woman: The word for Friday, which means coming together. (unintelligible). The messenger: No. No.\r\n                            44:44\r\n                            The messenger: It hasn't always been that. There was a time when there was no names of the weekdays. Like the Sabbath. You mean Sabbath?\r\n                            44:56\r\n                            The messenger: Yeah. Sure. They had the Friday Prayers before Muhammad.\r\n                            45:02\r\n                            The messenger: Well, you don't know that all the practices of Islam came through Abraham.\r\n                            45:12\r\n                            All the practices came from Abraham. Look at 16:123 will tell you.\r\n                            45:17\r\n                            Hamid: But wasn't the Prayer different from the Prayer at the time of Abraham? The messenger: No. Hamid: Five times Prayer? The messenger: Exactly the same. Yeah. Hamid: It's exactly the same? The messenger: Yep.\r\n                            45:27\r\n                            Hamid: And you think the prayer caused... I think your question was this way. If you wanna learn science, you go to university to learn it or you wanna learn it and then university is just a tool.\r\n                            45:43\r\n                            I think the Prayer is important and for that purpose you go to mosque. Or you have to go to mosque in order to Pray.\r\n                            45:52\r\n                            The messenger: Okay? Hamid: That was the question. Which comes first? Hamid: You can pray... The messenger: No. That's not the question. That is wrong.\r\n                            46:17\r\n                            The messenger: This is wrong. No, that's wrong. There's no \"when you're called.\" That's not in Arabic.\r\n                            46:25\r\n                            The messenger: When the Salat is announced. There's no \"you are called\" in Arabic.\r\n                            46:35\r\n                            It's a passive... I don't know what the English grammar is. It's a passive statement. It doesn't say that. It doesn't say \"when you are called.\"\r\n                            46:47\r\n                            Back to Catherine and the next Sura. Oh, let me emphasize.\r\n                            46:56\r\n                            Absolutely. This is what I was gonna say now. It is unfortunate that my generation, for example, in Iran, they grew up with the lack of the Friday prayer.\r\n                            Better to abandon a business deal of $10Million and attend Friday Prayer.\r\n                            47:07\r\n                            And it is not as firmly implanted in them to do the Friday Prayer until the Khomeini Revolution came and they started to do the Friday Prayer.\r\n                            47:18\r\n                            And I found it disastrous from my observations. There are many fortunate people like the Sabahis and the Moinis.\r\n                            47:26\r\n                            They came to the Friday Prayer readily. God is guiding them. And they did it easily. But it was not easy for many people to do the Friday Prayer. And I found it disastrous for them.\r\n                            47:38\r\n                            Just the Friday Prayer. Because they didn't do it. They caused their dropout.\r\n                            47:45\r\n                            I mean, I know that. I'm just trying to emphasize the extreme importance of the Friday Prayer. God is saying here \"and drop all business.\"\r\n                            47:56\r\n                            It is very important. And it says \"this is better for you.\" If you are waiting for somebody to sign a deal with you that will give you 10 million dollars. And that is at the time of the Prayer, God is telling you \"go to the Friday Prayer and leave those 10 million dollars, and it will be better for you.\"\r\n                            48:12\r\n                            Because God will give you 20 million. It is very important, and it is difficult for... If we grew up like the last generations of Iran, if we grew up without the obligatory Friday prayer, it becomes more difficult to adapt to the Friday Prayer.\r\n                            48:30\r\n                            And at the same time, the reward is also doubled. Actually, multiplied many-fold for doing that.\r\n                            48:39\r\n                            A man: I have been to other Middle East countries, but I imagine it is more or less the same.\r\n                            48:44\r\n                            I have, in this verse, I have the personal experience in Turkey.\r\n                            48:49\r\n                            And generally, women do not go to the Friday Prayer. And I asked someone in Iran, over there, and I said \"why don't women go to the Friday Prayer?\"\r\n                            49:00\r\n                            And he told me that it is because of a certain Hadith that decree that women shouldn't go.\r\n                            49:08\r\n                            And when I mentioned this verse, he couldn't say anything to me.\r\n                            49:13\r\n                            The messenger: It doesn't say \"O, you believing men.\" A man: It says \"O, you who believe.\" So, I mean, the verse is for both men and women. The messenger: Yeah.\r\n                            49:21\r\n                            A man: So, I guess, but they have a base in Hadith that the women aren't going to come to the Friday prayer. So, I think that \"O, you who believe\" is maybe \"O, you men.\"\r\n                            49:38\r\n                            The messenger: There is a Hadith that says that women should not go to the Friday Prayer. And the next Hadith says that women are deficient in religion because they don't go to the Friday Prayer.\r\n                            49:50\r\n                            I mean, what a catch-22.\r\n                            49:55\r\n                            A woman: In the article that was in the newspaper, they said that it's obligatory for the men to go, but it's optional for the women to go.\r\n                            50:03\r\n                            The messenger: In the paper, you mean the Islamic Center? No, they said \"we discourage that.\" They said \"we don't want women to go.\" Because they follow Hadith.\r\n                            50:13\r\n                            But, obviously, here, verse 9 says \"O, you who believe.\" It doesn't say men or women. This is an obligatory duty for men and women.\r\n                            50:22\r\n                            It's very, very important. Hamid: Why is it important? Why does it emphasize the importance of that?\r\n                            50:30\r\n                            The messenger: Because it's a commandment. This is a commandment from God. It says, [62:9] O you who believe, when the Congregational Prayer (Salat Al-Jumu'ah) is announced on Friday, you shall hasten to the commemoration of GOD, and drop all business.\r\n                            50:40\r\n                            This is a commandment from God. Hamid: Well, I can say a few reasons for why it is that particular day, the Friday. I think it is the end of the week. And, therefore, you can't...\r\n                            50:57\r\n                            The messenger: There's no excuse. Hamid: What? The messenger: Sorry. Hamid: So, you can actually go through the problems of the whole week and have a calm and answer the problems and then try to solve it within the community.\r\n                            51:15\r\n                            The messenger: That's not the purpose. The purpose is not solving problems. The purpose is to commemorate God in a group of people.\r\n                            51:25\r\n                            The messenger: That's the purpose. Hamid: I have a comment here. The messenger: Yeah. Hamid: I think, as a Muslim, it's very important to ask God's (unintelligible). Any particular action (unintelligible). He wants the excuse of \"O, you who believe.\"\r\n                            51:42\r\n                            The messenger: That's fine. Hamid: Why they are even where they were placed at home. Also, why they are doing when. The messenger: Right.\r\n                            51:51\r\n                            Hamid: And, going back to what you were saying earlier, emphasizing, why Friday, I guess, I would say, in most of the Islamic countries, Friday is the end of the week.\r\n                            52:08\r\n                            The messenger: You can make Wednesday the end of the week if you want to. Hamid: There is a good power here. As you know, we have a good power in the Muslim world. And, so, it goes from that.\r\n                            52:20\r\n                            The problems of the Muslim society and the dangers that modern society are going to face from the other non-believers and non-Muslim societies are to be discussed.\r\n                            52:35\r\n                            Because the majority of the people get together. And, since we all live in a society that is not facing great respect to all the people.\r\n                            52:46\r\n                            The mass of the people, the number of the people. And, these mass of the people are the ones that can prove their value. And, they have their own conclusions. And, they have their own problems.\r\n                            52:58\r\n                            It's not the way the society is now. Particularly, I would say, it's not yet the way to discuss the problems, discuss their actions...\r\n                            53:10\r\n                            The messenger: Yeah, this happens automatically. If you carry out a commandment, this will happen automatically. That's exactly the purpose of the Friday Prayer.\r\n                            53:17\r\n                            We all get together and we know each other. Hamid: It's not only to get together and pray to God. You can pray to God at our home. You know, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. But, there, in a place, there's 100,000 people...\r\n                            53:28\r\n                            The messenger: So, you agree with the Friday Prayer that this is important, right? Hamid: Yes, of course. The messenger: You do agree.\r\n                            53:35\r\n                            Hamid: ...acceptance. You know, why Friday, and you can only go on Friday and pray and don't talk about problems will take the concept away. What if, maybe it's nonsense, you shouldn't go. If the Imam is just talking nonsense, you'd better stay home.\r\n                            54:01\r\n                            The messenger: Then how will you change the situation if you stay at home? Hamid: You're not going there. You have to talk about the situation. You have to discuss the problem. You just, you just, I was just...\r\n                            54:14\r\n                            The messenger: What if the Imam is giving fantastic lessons that will save your life? Why do you assume the negative?\r\n                            54:20\r\n                            Hamid: The Imam cannot give us a fantastic lesson. We discussed it. You have show Showrunner. You have lots of people from different societies, from different beliefs, you know, discussing a problem.\r\n                            54:29\r\n                            You see what's happening. What has happened to you from Shanbe to Jumu'ah, from Saturday to Jumu'ah (Friday). What are the problems? It could be cultural problems, economic problems, social problems, cultural problems\r\n                            54:38\r\n                            The messenger: Yeah. That's fine. Hamid: And all these problems must be discussed... you are free. So, that's why you're have a Jumu'ah Prayer.\r\n                            54:45\r\n                            The messenger: I agree with you. Martha: The Jumu'ah Prayer could be a Monday (unintelligible) Wednesday (unintelligible). Hamid: Oh, no.\r\n                            54:57\r\n                            Martha: I think, I think, ...... in Arabic....I don't know why you said that. It just makes no real sense. The name itself preserves that.\r\n                            55:08\r\n                            No matter what day of the week it calls on, in other languages, in Arabic, you just have to get around it. That's all you need. It's the name of the day.\r\n                            55:17\r\n                            You can give it a name from the fact that it's Friday. The messenger: I don't think anyone is objecting to do the Friday prayer on Friday.\r\n                            55:24\r\n                            Martha: No. I mean, the idea is that, this Friday is because that, that allows you to discuss and be free on Friday.\r\n                            55:34\r\n                            The messenger: Well, people are free to say what they want. Hamid: Well, Friday, you're emotionally ready. You don't have any classes. You don't have any work to do. We all have business, family on Saturday, yeah. (Unintelligible).\r\n                            55:47\r\n                            Martha: In a Muslim country, if the day of gathering together were on a Wednesday, everything should be adjusted. All the companies should be closed.\r\n                            55:57\r\n                            The messenger: Oh, Martha, Martha, please, let's not discuss nonsense here. I mean, not you. Please Just, we can go on discussing the vain talk. Let's go back to Catherine and Sura 62. 63.\r\n                            56:09\r\n                            We can make an assumption and go on discussing it, you know. What if the sky is green? You know, let's discuss that.\r\n                            56:16\r\n                            63. Catherine: The Hypocrites (Al-Munaafeqoon) In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\r\n                            56:23\r\n                            [63:1] When the hypocrites come to you they say, \"We bear witness that you are the messenger of GOD.\"* GOD knows that you are His messenger, and GOD bears witness that the hypocrites are liars.\r\n                            56:34\r\n                            [63:2] Under the guise of their apparent faith, they repel the people from the path of GOD. Miserable indeed is what they do.\r\n                            56:40\r\n                            [63:3] This is because they believed, then disbelieved. Hence, their minds are blocked; they do not understand.\r\n                            56:47\r\n                            [63:4] When you see them, you may be impressed by their looks. And when they speak, you may listen to their eloquence. They are like standing logs. They think that every call is intended against them. These are the real enemies; beware of them. GOD condemns them; they have deviated.\r\n                            57:01\r\n                            [63:5] When they are told, \"Come let the messenger of GOD pray for your forgiveness,\" they mockingly turn their heads, and you see them repel others and act arrogantly.\r\n                            57:08\r\n                            [63:6] It is the same for them, whether you pray for their forgiveness, or not pray for their forgiveness; GOD will not forgive them. For GOD does not guide the wicked people.\r\n                            57:16\r\n                            [63:7] They are the ones who say, \"Do not give any money to those who followed the messenger of GOD, perhaps they abandon him!\" However, GOD possesses the treasures of the heavens and the earth, but the hypocrites do not comprehend.\r\n                            57:28\r\n                            [63:8] They say, \"If we go back to the city, the powerful therein will evict the weak (and we will be victimized).\" (They should know that) all dignity belongs to GOD and His messenger, and the believers. However, the hypocrites do not know.\r\n                            57:41\r\n                            Verse 1, the footnote says \"even though the hypocrites are uttering a truth, God calls them liars.\r\n                            57:48\r\n                            He teaches us that we must reject all fabrications attributed to the prophet in the name of Hadith even if such Hadith narrates a truth.\r\n                            57:56\r\n                            The fabrication of a good Hadith is the bait that Satan uses to cover a deadly hook.\r\n                            58:03\r\n                            There are many people who are very talented with words in their individual languages.\r\n                            58:10\r\n                            And how scriptures and Hadiths and the oral traditions in Jewish faith and so on came to be\r\n                            58:20\r\n                            was those human beings who were very talented with words took the truth and elaborated upon them to the point where they became\r\n                            58:28\r\n                            man-made laws, regulations, suggestions, traditions,\r\n                            58:34\r\n                            to the point where those became the truth that people followed as opposed to the real message which was at the core originally.\r\n                            58:41\r\n                            There is some truth, some veracity to what we hear in all things.\r\n                            58:47\r\n                            The test is to figure out where it is and what it is. If you know what the truth is from the beginning, you can recognize the distortions.\r\n                            58:55\r\n                            Sometimes they're so well done that it's hard to argue with people. Because you're not as articulate as they are for instance.\r\n                            59:04\r\n                            Some people are very articulate, very well versed with the words and very good abstract thinkers if I can use that phrase. And I'm not.\r\n                            59:12\r\n                            I just know what the truth is, thank God. And when it starts, it's so complicated that it's hard to find it in what I'm hearing,\r\n                            59:19\r\n                            I have to stop that and I have to say \"no.\" There is a fine line here.\r\n                            59:24\r\n                            God says \"even if there's truth in what we hear mixed in with the distortion, we're to discard all of it because it is a game and it's Satan's game. It isn't a person's game that's talking to you.\"\r\n                            59:36\r\n                            It's Satan's game. Satan's out to bring us on those things that we're perhaps not as sure about, not as able to argue about\r\n                            59:46\r\n                            to get us to go to him and forget God alone. And this is really difficult because this is in the media, this is in the newspaper. It's everywhere.\r\n                            59:55\r\n                            It's everywhere. It's in comedy. It is on free time. I mean, the distortions are everywhere, and the truth is always buried in there somewhere.\r\n                            1:00:04\r\n                            It's almost like playing chess, you know, when it's your turn to move, you have to walk very carefully to the next square\r\n                            1:00:11\r\n                            because there's so much of that stuff all around us. And it's stuff, don't laugh.\r\n                            1:00:21\r\n                            Chess. Ok.\r\n                            1:00:27\r\n                            [63:2] Under the guise of their apparent faith, they repel the people from the path of GOD. Miserable indeed is what they do.\r\n                            1:00:32\r\n                            [63:3] This is because they believed, then disbelieved. Hence, their minds are blocked; they do not understand.\r\n                            1:00:37\r\n                            Once a person has believed and then disbelieved, they're done. God will continue to support that person throughout their life here, and give them even the things that they want, but they'll never get to the truth.\r\n                            1:00:52\r\n                            Once they had had it, and gave it up, they won't be able to come back.\r\n                            1:00:57\r\n                            And God is very definite in this verse about that. And then goes on to describe them as if they were wooden logs. And we may be impressed, as I said earlier, by their appearance, by the way they look.\r\n                            1:01:12\r\n                            Verse 8 says that [63:8] ....all dignity belongs to GOD and His messenger, and the believers. However, the hypocrites do not know.\r\n                            1:01:21\r\n                            We are provided for. Everything we need is provided for. So, when people who don't understand that plot and scheme to prevent us from getting the things that we're supposed to get,\r\n                            1:01:33\r\n                            it's totally useless. We get what we're supposed to get from God, not from anyone else.\r\n                            1:01:38\r\n                            So, those schemes and plans to disrupt or disband or fight with don't go anywhere. They're diffused before they ever get off the ground.\r\n                            1:01:49\r\n                            What they do do is keep those people occupied and out of our business while we go about it.\r\n                            1:01:56\r\n                            Because they're busy doing things that are fruitless. And that's a form of protection for us as well.\r\n                            description of intersession and repentance.\r\n                            1:02:02\r\n                            Because we know that we can't be hurt by them.\r\n                            1:02:07\r\n                            Does anyone have any comments, additions, subtractions on that section?\r\n                            1:02:15\r\n                            The messenger: Abdullah?\r\n                            1:02:21\r\n                            Abdullah: When verse 6, where the messenger has to give (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:02:38\r\n                            If that's the case, when people ask \"why do you ask?\" (Unintelligible). Does God mean that when you ask something like that, it doesn't matter what he asks?\r\n                            1:02:55\r\n                            The messenger: No. What this means is that God will accept the prayer for forgiveness for the believers, but not for the hypocrites.\r\n                            1:03:04\r\n                            The messenger: That's what it's telling us. They are too arrogant anyway, and they don't have the belief in their hearts. So they think it's all nonsense anyway.\r\n                            1:03:15\r\n                            The messenger: Pardon? Dr. Sabahi: So, it doesn't have anything to do with SHAFA'AT (Intercession)? The messenger: No, it actually proves there is no SHAFA'AT (Intercession).\r\n                            1:03:25\r\n                            Because it's only the believers who will be helped, and the believers are going to Heaven anyway.\r\n                            1:03:33\r\n                            The disbelievers and the hypocrites cannot be helped, so what's the use of SHAFA'AT? So, this was the Quranic position.\r\n                            1:03:40\r\n                            The Quranic position is that every one of us, IN SHAA ALLAH, when we go to Heaven, will say \"please God, I want my mother with me.\"\r\n                            1:03:49\r\n                            \"I love her very much.\" Ok? And this is SHAFA'AT. You will say it. I will say it. Everyone will say it. IN SHAA ALLAH in Heaven.\r\n                            1:03:58\r\n                            Now, this SHAFA'AT is useful if the mother is a good person that is already going to Heaven.\r\n                            1:04:06\r\n                            If the mother was not to go to Heaven, this SHAFA'AT will not do any good. Therefore, it is really useless.But we will say it anyway, out of emotion.\r\n                            1:04:15\r\n                            So, this is the understanding of SHAFA'AT. And this is exactly what this verse was saying.\r\n                            1:04:20\r\n                            It is saying when the messenger asks for forgiveness, it will be accepted for the believers, but not for the hypocrites or the disbelievers.\r\n                            1:04:31\r\n                            Exactly. Because it's true.\r\n                            1:04:37\r\n                            Catherine: It's our human nature to do it. The messenger: Not because it's something that is... Because it's a fact.\r\n                            1:04:49\r\n                            The messenger: Yes. The messenger: Anybody can repent. I think this is a point that Catherine raised.\r\n                            1:04:57\r\n                            But if a person goes back from belief to disbelief, they can always repent and come back to it.\r\n                            1:05:02\r\n                            There are other verses in the Quran. In Sura 4, verse 137, it says, you can believe, disbelieve, believe, disbelieve, and so on.\r\n                            1:05:14\r\n                            So, the Quran is talking about the period when they are disbelievers.\r\n                            1:05:25\r\n                            The messenger: No, there is no such thing as God cannot. Repeat.\r\n                            1:05:30\r\n                            Rephrase your question.\r\n                            1:05:38\r\n                            No, no, no. There is no such thing as God cannot. Now, rephrase your question.\r\n                            1:05:47\r\n                            There you go. Yeah. Now, you can have it. Go ahead.\r\n                            1:05:59\r\n                            Yeah. This is the end of the verse. Look at it. Verse 6. \"God does not guide the wicked people.\"\r\n                            1:06:06\r\n                            They are already wicked, so He does not guide them.\r\n                            1:06:12\r\n                            Yes, they can, because this is our free decision.\r\n                            1:06:17\r\n                            God will (unintelligible) to their repentance. The minute they change their decision to believers, they are believers.\r\n                            1:06:26\r\n                            Not as long as they're hypocrites or disbelievers. Only when they make a decision to believe.\r\n                            1:06:31\r\n                            Right. As soon as they make a decision to believe, they step into God's Kingdom.\r\n                            1:06:37\r\n                            Right. As long as they are hypocrites and disbelievers, they are outside of God's circle.\r\n                            1:06:43\r\n                            The messenger: Douglas? Douglas: In these verses, God is revealing to us (unintelligible). He's revealing to us so otherwise we will know. We could see they are liars. They cannot understand. They do not know. God is revealing to us but otherwise we may not be able to see.\r\n                            1:07:07\r\n                            The messenger: Cause we don't see Douglas: Cause we don't see. The messenger: God says \"I know them, you don't know them.\" Douglas: Right.\r\n                            1:07:13\r\n                            Douglas: The other point I wanted to make is basically, when we use this example of wooden logs, does this mean, for example, like food, clothing and water, it's all service? The messenger: No.\r\n                            1:07:25\r\n                            Douglas: I'm just asking. How logs (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:07:31\r\n                            The messenger: No. Can you communicate with a wooden log?\r\n                            1:07:44\r\n                            The messenger: In fact, there's an Arabic, there's an Egyptian, excuse me, there's an Egyptian proverb and an English proverb.\r\n                            1:07:50\r\n                            It says \"they're standing there like a log.\" Is this in English? Turkish. Yes. And in Arabic, too. And English. And Egyptian.\r\n                            1:08:05\r\n                            Did we finish Sura 63? Go ahead and finish it. Catherine: Verse 9. [63:9] O you who believe, do not be distracted by your money and your children from remembering GOD. Those who do this are the losers.\r\n                            1:08:17\r\n                            [63:10] You shall give from our provisions to you before death comes to you, then you say, \"My Lord, if only You could delay this for a short while! I would then be charitable and join the righteous!\"\r\n                            1:08:27\r\n                            [63:11] GOD never delays the appointed time of death for any soul. GOD is fully Cognizant of everything you do.\r\n                            1:08:37\r\n                            The easiest thing in the world to do is to be distracted by those that we care about the most. And God warns us against that. In other verses, He says that these may be enemies of ours, and we do need to be cautious of that and avoid idolatry.\r\n                            1:08:51\r\n                            Spending in charity is so easy if we know that nothing we have came from us or will go with us anywhere.\r\n                            1:08:57\r\n                            It comes from God. It's not ours to start with. And if we give it in charity, we give it only where it was meant to go.\r\n                            1:09:03\r\n                            Verse 11 says [63:11] GOD never delays the appointed time of death for any soul....\r\n                            1:09:10\r\n                            And there's nothing more that you can do after the Day of Resurrection. But there is so much mercy from God, and we have so many chances before that day. So many. They're limitless.\r\n                            1:09:20\r\n                            As long as we live, we have a chance, an opportunity God constantly provides those opportunities for the hypocrites to repent, for us to continue to work right up until the last moment.\r\n                            1:09:31\r\n                            That verse 11 sounds very final, but when we know the mercy of God and what He provides for us on a minute-to-minute, second-to-second basis in this world, it's extraordinary.\r\n                            1:09:44\r\n                            And it doesn't need to frighten us. We just need to know that there is a limit. And once we've reached it, it's over. We have no more to do.\r\n                            1:09:54\r\n                            Any other comments and questions? A man: May I ask a question?\r\n                            1:10:01\r\n                            The messenger: Yeah. Go ahead. The messenger: Let's just thank Catherine for an excellent Quranic study.\r\n                            1:10:07\r\n                            Catherine: I can go to 114 in 10 minutes if you say you want me to go.\r\n                            1:10:12\r\n                            The messenger: Now, we'll get to general questions. The messenger: Farhad?\r\n                            1:10:20\r\n                            Farhad: ...Many, many, many decisions have to be made and why? Sometimes a group of people think as (unintelligible), toward a Sura and Aya (verse) (unintelligible). What is the criterion to to order of what this was more important than this?\r\n                            1:10:46\r\n                            (unintelligible). Is there any criteria like that? Or that's my suggestion.\r\n                            1:10:55\r\n                            The messenger: Everything God said, excuse me... Farhad: The number of times that a subject involves being mentioned, is that important?\r\n                            Being a good person without observing the commandments is in vain.\r\n                            1:11:05\r\n                            The messenger: That's a good sign, yeah. But all of them are important. All the laws are important.\r\n                            1:11:11\r\n                            I wanna go back to the Friday business. Remember that the title of the Sura is named after the Prayer, \"Friday.\"\r\n                            1:11:19\r\n                            It is a Sura in the Quran entitled \"Friday.\" And the commandment is there saying \"O you who believe when the Salat Prayer's announced on Friday, go and drop all business.\" That's the commandment.\r\n                            1:11:31\r\n                            All the commandments of God are important.\r\n                            1:11:36\r\n                            Farhad: Why is \"La Elaha Ella Allah\" more important than anything else? The messenger: Cause this is the basic requirement, you know. I mean, if it's not there, nothing else exists.\r\n                            1:11:46\r\n                            Everything else will be in vain. I mean, a person can be truthful and honest and is a very nice person but he does not believe in God, and all his work is in vain.\r\n                            1:12:00\r\n                            So, \"La Elaha Ella Allah\" goes without saying. Then after that, all the commandments are very important. Every single one of them.\r\n                            1:12:13\r\n                            Farhad: For example, can you say Salat is more important than Zakat? The messenger: No.\r\n                            1:12:19\r\n                            Farhad: Because it's mentioned more than Zakat. The messenger: Actually, they are both usually mentioned together, Salat and Zakat.\r\n                            1:12:27\r\n                            Farhad: Or Fasting. The messenger: Fasting is very important. The messenger: You're disobeying God if you don't fast. You're disobeying God if you don't do the Zakat. You're disobeying God if you don't do the Prayer. You're disobeying God if you lie or cheat.\r\n                            1:12:40\r\n                            So, take your pick. It's very expensive if you... A woman: But also, I think it's important to say that God knows what's true and what we have to do and God always gives, you know, people who can't do it, gives us alternatives.\r\n                            1:12:54\r\n                            The messenger: Well, it's our choice, you know. You can put your finger in the fire or not. It's up to you.\r\n                            1:13:01\r\n                            I mean, God left it up to us.\r\n                            1:13:10\r\n                            You heard Jehan today. If he doesn't wanna do the push-ups, he will think that God is doing everything, not him.\r\n                            1:13:20\r\n                            So, it's as simple as that. We're celebrating Laila's birthday today.\r\n                            1:13:29\r\n                            I don't mean to embarrass you. But her birthday was the 19th of March, is that so?\r\n                            1:13:38\r\n                            And she didn't even know that her address was a multiple of 19.\r\n                            1:13:46\r\n                            So, this is why she came to Tucson. Celebrating her birthday with us.\r\n                            1:13:52\r\n                            There are so many things that we need to do. We read Al-Fãtehah for Soad, remember? Because of her tests.\r\n                            Congregation asked to recite Fateha for someone’s exam.\r\n                            1:14:01\r\n                            Well, she passed.\r\n                            1:14:10\r\n                            But there's another big test coming up.\r\n                            1:14:17\r\n                            And she's greedy again. And she wants us to read Al-Fãtehah for her.\r\n                            1:14:23\r\n                            God never turns us down. And Ahmad needs that we ask Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala to help him with his PhD exam. It's Monday?\r\n                            1:14:37\r\n                            Yes, of course. Yes, you better. You better ask.\r\n                            1:14:46\r\n                            God is generous. God is generous. And we have a perfect record so far, Alhamdu Lillah.\r\n                            1:14:53\r\n                            God never never turns us down. Strange things we asked for. And He never turned us down.\r\n                            1:15:00\r\n                            We even overturned governments. We did that.\r\n                            1:15:06\r\n                            What else? You're supposed to remind me.

Here the past tense is used because we know that the decision was made before we ever came into this dimension.\r\n                            0:30\r\n                            So, we possess, those of us who possess intelligence, even though we blew it because we wavered,\r\n                            0:36\r\n                            we didn't take an absolute stand for God, still we didn't do what the jinns did and just totally disbelieve.\r\n                            0:45\r\n                            We just showed some intelligence and we believed. And God sends us reminders. He sends us the messages. He sends us the scriptures and the messengers to\r\n                            0:57\r\n                            recite the scriptures and to clarify things as reminders because\r\n                            1:02\r\n                            just because we made that initial decision doesn't guarantee that we're not going to make mistakes and go out of God's Kingdom. So, we have to be constantly reminded\r\n                            1:15\r\n                            about God's laws, about how to exhort each other to be righteous. We have to remind each other to do certain things, to give charity.\r\n                            1:25\r\n                            We have to remind each other and ourselves because it's really easy to forget in your day-to-day life when you're out in the environment where people disbelieve.\r\n                            1:36\r\n                            And it's very easy to fall into that and to forget and we need that constant reminder.\r\n                            1:44\r\n                            Are there any questions so far to this point?\r\n                            Explains divorce.\r\n                            2:04\r\n                            The messenger: Yes.\r\n                            2:09\r\n                            The messenger: No, it says provide, you pay, because it's your responsibility.\r\n                            2:20\r\n                            A nursing mother? Because, see, the divorced wife may want to refuse to nurse the children, say \"I'm not gonna do anything anymore. You take care of the baby.\"\r\n                            2:33\r\n                            Then, you can hire a nursing mother. So, you have to think of the circumstances of divorce.\r\n                            2:39\r\n                            They're really straightforward instructions.\r\n                            2:47\r\n                            The messenger: Yes. Because you're telling her \"you cannot get married.\" You're telling her \"since you're carrying my baby, you cannot get married.\"\r\n                            2:57\r\n                            When you say that, then you have to put your money where your mouth is. This is how we say the expression.\r\n                            3:05\r\n                            When you say that, you have to provide for them.\r\n                            3:14\r\n                            She may be doing a favor because maybe she can't stand the circumstances, or you, or the house, or, you know, she may go on strike.\r\n                            3:23\r\n                            It's her right. We're coming to, which verses did you finish, 11? Why don't you finish the whole Sura and then I have a couple of comments.\r\n                            3:34\r\n                            This is Sura 65. Lori: Verse 11. [65:11] a messenger* who recites to you GOD's revelations, clearly, to lead those who believe and work righteousness out of the darkness into the light. Anyone who believes in GOD and leads a righteous life, He will admit him into gardens with flowing streams; they abide therein forever. GOD will generously reward him.\r\n                            3:59\r\n                            Again, we're told here that the messenger recites God's revelation. He's just the disburser of information, the clarifier, the warner, the reminder.\r\n                            4:08\r\n                            The revelations are God's. The commandments are God's. The laws are God's laws.\r\n                            4:14\r\n                            And the messenger is sent as a mercy to us to lead us out of the darkness and into the light. Because otherwise,\r\n                            4:20\r\n                            we wouldn't do what we were supposed to do, and we're going to be held accountable. And God is so merciful that He doesn't do that.\r\n                            4:27\r\n                            He doesn't hold us accountable unless He gives us every chance that He can possibly give us. So, we have the scriptures. We have the messengers.\r\n                            4:35\r\n                            We have all of these things at our disposal to make the right decisions.\r\n                            4:40\r\n                            And when we do it, then we're guaranteed not only in this life happiness, but eternal happiness forever.\r\n                            4:48\r\n                            And the rewards are generous. We don't have to worry about it at all. And\r\n                            5:00\r\n                            It's just so clear. And I think these verses, even though they're only a few, like Rashad said, are so profound because\r\n                            5:08\r\n                            you can't find any fault in any of them. You may not personally agree because you have a different outlook or something, but you can't find fault in any of these verses. They make perfect sense\r\n                            5:19\r\n                            because they're from God. God is Omniscient.\r\n                            5:25\r\n                            Verse 12. [65:12] GOD created seven universes and the same number of earths. The commands flow among them. This is to let you know that GOD is Omnipotent, and that GOD is fully aware of all things.\r\n                            5:38\r\n                            And if you look at the footnote at the bottom of the page, it says..., this page, I don't know about your page The messenger: It's Ok.\r\n                            5:47\r\n                            Lori: It says *65:12 Although God created six other planets that are identical to our Earth, there is life only on our planet. Thus, the evolutionists will be shown on the Day of Judgment that life did not just \"evolve\" on the planet because of its particular circumstances.\r\n                            Explains “rebelling” against God’s Law. Explains “leading a righteous Life”\r\n                            6:03\r\n                            We know that the earth was created as Satan's dominion. And that's why there's life and we are his constituents.\r\n                            6:11\r\n                            And we are here temporarily to repent for our initial transgression and to develop our souls\r\n                            6:18\r\n                            to be able to return to God and withstand His presence. And that's not necessary in any of the other universes. So, life is just on earth.\r\n                            6:38\r\n                            Lori: Any comments? The messenger: Questions? The messenger: Okay, the comments that I wish to make on Sura 65, verse 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.\r\n                            6:50\r\n                            Okay, number 8 is rebelling against God's laws and commandments. Messengers come to remind us of these laws, like \"the mosque belongs to God, do not mention any other name besides God.\" This is a law.\r\n                            7:06\r\n                            And when they rebel, it's a sign that retribution is coming to them fast.\r\n                            7:14\r\n                            This is what verse 8 is saying. Many a community rebelled against God's law and against his messengers.\r\n                            7:20\r\n                            Consequently, we held them strictly responsible or accountable and afflicted them with a terrible retribution.\r\n                            7:27\r\n                            So, it's coming to all those who are not following God's law. Number 10,\r\n                            7:34\r\n                            [65:10] GOD has prepared for them severe retribution. Therefore, you shall reverence GOD, O you who possess intelligence and believed. GOD has sent down to you a message—*\r\n                            7:47\r\n                            Now, number 11 is really the one that I want to emphasize here, because it's written, I don't know if I put it in past tense here, 11, past tense, believed.\r\n                            8:00\r\n                            Okay, here I don't have it in past. It is in the past tense that the messenger leads those who believed and led a righteous life out of darkness into the light.\r\n                            8:12\r\n                            So, these are people who believe and work righteousness, but they are still in the darkness.\r\n                            8:19\r\n                            The messenger cannot do anything to those who don't believe. But he helps those who did believe and did lead a righteous life out of darkness into the light.\r\n                            8:29\r\n                            This is a very important concept.\r\n                            8:35\r\n                            Anyone who believes in God and works righteousness, God will admit him into gardens of flowing streams.\r\n                            8:40\r\n                            This fits with verse about 11 in Sura 10, that says that God guides those who believe because of their belief.\r\n                            8:48\r\n                            So, when we make a decision to believe in God, then God will create circumstances and will help us to lead us out of darkness into the light.\r\n                            8:57\r\n                            And this follows believing and leading a righteous life.\r\n                            Explains Evolution. “Species created independently”. Explains other Earths and we are “believing evolutionists”.\r\n                            9:04\r\n                            Number 12 is very important in this age of evolution, creation, debates.\r\n                            9:10\r\n                            Evolution is a divinely guided process. Evolution is a fact.\r\n                            9:15\r\n                            It is a scientific fact and it is a Quranic fact. I'm gonna have an appendix on it.\r\n                            9:20\r\n                            When you read the appendix, you'll see that evolution is perfectly all right. But it is a divinely guided process.\r\n                            9:29\r\n                            The fly has 4,000 lenses in each eye. 4,000. It did not evolve into 10,000. It didn't evolve into x-ray vision.\r\n                            9:38\r\n                            For millions of years, for millions of years, it is 4,000 lenses in each eye.\r\n                            9:46\r\n                            But there are varieties of flies. Within the same species, there is evolution, within the same species.\r\n                            9:54\r\n                            We got the navel orange out of the regular oranges. All of a sudden, we have this wonderful orange without any seeds, tastes good.\r\n                            10:04\r\n                            But it came from another orange tree, not from an apple tree. So, it's from the same species. There is evolution within the species.\r\n                            10:11\r\n                            But every species was created independently. But the point that I want to emphasize here that you need to remember is that God created seven earths identical to this earth.\r\n                            10:22\r\n                            And the statistical laws bear this out. But there is no life on them.\r\n                            10:30\r\n                            Because on the Day of Judgment, which is the most important day, that's the Eternal Day, when all the people past, present, and future will be there,\r\n                            10:40\r\n                            we will all be there and we will all witness that there were six other earths like this one, but no life on any of them.\r\n                            10:47\r\n                            Because what the evolutionists, the atheist evolutionists say, because we are believing evolutionists. They are atheist evolutionists.\r\n                            10:58\r\n                            The atheist evolutionists say that life evolved out of nothing here on this earth.\r\n                            11:04\r\n                            Because of the circumstances, because of the amino acids, the lightning, the ethylene, and all the other nitrogen and stuff.\r\n                            11:13\r\n                            A man: Is that the Big Bang Theory? The messenger: No, it's not the Big Bang Theory. The Big Bang Theory is confirmed in the Quran.\r\n                            11:20\r\n                            The evolution, Darwin's theory, that life evolved on this earth, and\r\n                            11:27\r\n                            and this is how our eyes came into being, that this eye was a depression in a photosensitive cell, a depression in the skin that kept evolving until it gave the eye.\r\n                            11:39\r\n                            But I wonder why we have the eyes here and not in our hands, for example.\r\n                            11:46\r\n                            So, this is the purpose of creating six other earths, identical to this one.\r\n                            11:53\r\n                            Pardon? Laila: Because the eyes are walking... The messenger: You have eyes in your feet, Laila?\r\n                            11:59\r\n                            Laila: I think so. I didn't even breathe. The messenger: Well, that's a step in evolution, but still within the species.\r\n                            12:09\r\n                            You're still a human being.\r\n                            12:14\r\n                            Any questions on Sura 65?\r\n                            12:22\r\n                            Oh, yes. This is... where is Poopak? Poopak.\r\n                            12:27\r\n                            How come you're so quiet? Poopak discovered a mistake in the new translation on this page, 559.\r\n                            12:38\r\n                            And, of course, you know the rule. God doesn't make mistakes. If there's any mistake, it's our mistake.\r\n                            12:45\r\n                            To be specific, it's my mistake. Ok. I forgot to put one word \"God\" here. The count at the bottom of the page is alright. It's right.\r\n                            12:56\r\n                            But as you know, at the bottom of the page, I have the count of the word \"God\" on the left side, and the total after this page on this side.\r\n                            13:02\r\n                            So, the reader can participate in the mathematical code of the Quran and realize this is God speaking to him or her.\r\n                            13:09\r\n                            So, I forgot, there's one statement...\r\n                            13:18\r\n                            Huh? I forgot where it is now.\r\n                            13:24\r\n                            Hmm? Number 8? [65:8] Many a community rebelled against the commands...\r\n                            13:30\r\n                            A woman: It says here it says God's law. The messenger: Okay, yeah, so that's it. It's in verse 8, I believe. But anyway, we will fix it. These are unedited pages.\r\n                            13:40\r\n                            Lisa hasn't got to that point yet, right? Lisa and Emily. Oh, Emily marked it.\r\n                            13:45\r\n                            So, we're still working with unedited pages.\r\n                            13:51\r\n                            But the count is perfect, and we just made a typing error. A man: Yeah, I would like to make a regression to verse number 7. The messenger: OK.\r\n                            Explains divorce and observing God’s laws leads to happiness.\r\n                            14:03\r\n                            A man: Specifically, aside from what I understand, aside from the net, like it works that way,\r\n                            14:10\r\n                            of the house he provided to the wife, he gave the man, asked what he was.\r\n                            14:16\r\n                            I don't see, I mean, I can't present my mind thinking somehow rationale more than spiritual. I try to stretch my spiritual.\r\n                            14:23\r\n                            You know, I go through my rationale anyway. And I see, for example, in verse 7, I mean, there is so much room for interpretation in the case of divorce.\r\n                            14:34\r\n                            And even as to what is rich and what is poor. The messenger: Yeah. Thank God. A man: You know, that's where you go to the woman and go to the man.\r\n                            14:42\r\n                            The messenger: Thank God. A man: There's so much room for interpretation. I'm just wondering how, I mean, practical conflicts are being resolved.\r\n                            14:53\r\n                            The messenger: Well, it's really straightforward, but you said it is the rationale, it is common sense. There's a rich man and a poor man. When there is divorce, there's compensation. You must compensate the wife, the divorced wife.\r\n                            15:05\r\n                            And you must provide for her for at least one year. This is in Sura 4. A man: Let's assume there is difference between the opinion...\r\n                            15:13\r\n                            The messenger: Okay, there is a husband who is a millionaire and a husband who is hand to mouth.\r\n                            15:19\r\n                            So, how will they provide this alimony?\r\n                            15:24\r\n                            Right. That's what the verse is saying. It's according to your... It's strictly between you and God, really.\r\n                            15:32\r\n                            You don't have to apply any of these laws, but you bear the responsibility, see? A man: ...Who arbitrates the conflict? How are...\r\n                            15:42\r\n                            The messenger: It's strictly between you and God. It's like everything else, like praying or fasting or drinking or gambling.\r\n                            15:52\r\n                            All things are strictly between you and God. God is telling you these laws. If you want to be happy, follow them. If you wanna be miserable, don't follow them. It's as simple as that.\r\n                            16:01\r\n                            So, if you are rich and you divorce your wife, you must provide according to your wealth.\r\n                            16:08\r\n                            If you are poor, then God is Merciful. He's telling you that you can only provide as much as you can. A man: But there is no immediate remedy as to whether it's fair or unfair. There is no immediate remedy to that.\r\n                            16:20\r\n                            The messenger: It has to be fair. A man: I understand, but if it's not, there is no immediate remedy to that.\r\n                            16:28\r\n                            The messenger: Well, in Sura 4 there is arbitration. Sura 4, not verse 4, Sura 4. Yeah.\r\n                            16:35\r\n                            In Sura 4, there is arbitration. There are provisions for everything. There are details. Sura 4 is the second longest Sura in the Quran. And it has a lot more details.\r\n                            16:48\r\n                            But see, these are basic rules. And just like you said, we really use our rationale, our common sense. We're doing alright. Use your rationale.\r\n                            16:58\r\n                            A man: I can't, you know, whenever I start, I try to use only my spiritual. Somehow I end up, you know, using my rationale at the same time.\r\n                            17:05\r\n                            The messenger: There is no contradiction. Spiritual and rationale must go together.\r\n                            17:11\r\n                            But we have a tendency to make things difficult for ourselves. The Quran says that. The Quran says\r\n                            17:18\r\n                            \"if we listen to you, you'll make things more miserable and difficult for yourselves.\"\r\n                            17:25\r\n                            So, God said \"the rich compensates according to his wealth and the poor compensates according to his abilities.\"\r\n                            17:33\r\n                            And this is...It's merciful that He didn't say you have to give this much or this proportion. A man: But when I was in Saudi Arabia, I knew that there were some cases that were dealt with by religious judges. The messenger: Judges, yeah.\r\n                            17:47\r\n                            The messenger: What did they do? A man: Well, basically they referred, you know, to the Quran to resolve these kind of issues. You know, it's very much comparable to, you know, I mean, the...\r\n                            Knowledge brings us closer to the Quran.\r\n                            18:04\r\n                            The messenger: ...Western laws. Did you see anything... A man: You know, ...to written laws. These are, I mean, the Quran is taken as a written law.....\r\n                            18:15\r\n                            The messenger: But you see, the more the human being is educated, the more he comes closer to the Quran. The more, yes, the more knowledge they acquire,\r\n                            18:25\r\n                            the more, I mean, they're just about to prohibit alcohol, for example. Here's a drunk captain who polluted Alaska because of alcohol.\r\n                            18:34\r\n                            The whole country knows the evils of alcohol. So, when they look at the Quran, they say \"alcohol is prohibited.\"\r\n                            18:42\r\n                            It matches the common sense. It matches their knowledge.\r\n                            18:48\r\n                            I mean, this man had a ten mile wide channel. They said a child can maneuver this super tanker through those ten miles.\r\n                            18:58\r\n                            But he's not even a child. I mean, he's passed out.\r\n                            19:08\r\n                            I bet you the crew was drunk also.\r\n                            19:15\r\n                            I think it takes a clever captain to hit those rocks.\r\n                            19:23\r\n                            No, they wouldn't do that. The guy was drunk, you know. So, what I'm saying is that the more knowledge the human being acquires, the closer they get to God's laws on their own.\r\n                            19:34\r\n                            Hamid: Aren't you gonna go as far as getting the advice of the judges because after all we are humans.\r\n                            19:44\r\n                            And when it comes to dividing your own wealth, you may, it will be better (unintelligible). So, I just listen to you and (unintelligible).\r\n                            19:59\r\n                            If someone has to pass a judgment on the wealth of a guy, if it's left up to the first man,\r\n                            20:07\r\n                            which is the man who is very wealthy, if someone has to step in and the wife brings the checkbook,\r\n                            20:17\r\n                            what do you think this would mean?\r\n                            20:23\r\n                            The messenger: Well, remember that believers' affairs are decided by consultation. We're talking about believers.\r\n                            20:30\r\n                            If they're believers, they will be fair, and they will consult, and they will maintain...\r\n                            20:36\r\n                            Again, in Sura 4, like Lori mentioned, God emphasizes the amicable relations.\r\n                            20:42\r\n                            So, a husband and wife didn't get along together and decided to part. They don't have to be enemies.\r\n                            20:48\r\n                            In fact, God says \"you must maintain the amicable relations among you.\" So, there will be mutual consultation and mutual contentment.\r\n                            20:57\r\n                            Hamid: But realistically, you mentioned about alcohol. Yeah, it shouldn't be there. It should be prohibited. The messenger: Right.\r\n                            “Islamic Judges”.\r\n                            21:04\r\n                            Hamid: But the reality, I'm talking about... the nowadays life. I'm just imagining this.\r\n                            21:14\r\n                            The messenger: Hamid, you're hung up on the time of applicability of the Quran. The Quran is applicable through any time, till the end of the world. Not nowadays.\r\n                            21:22\r\n                            Hamid: Are you saying we do not need Islamic judges? Is that the content of the argument? Should we go to Istanbul?\r\n                            21:33\r\n                            The messenger: No, actually, we do need Islamic judges. I didn't say that. Yeah.\r\n                            21:39\r\n                            Because the general public will not be as familiar with the Quran as they should be, or as they need to be. So, the Islamic judges are needed.\r\n                            21:48\r\n                            I hit somebody's car, and then so how much do I compensate that person? Then, we both go to the Islamic judge, and the person whose car I hit, he will say \"this cost me $800 to fix, and I lost 8 hours of work, and this and this.\"\r\n                            22:03\r\n                            Then, the judge will calculate that, and will tell me to compensate the person.\r\n                            22:08\r\n                            Hamid: I thought you said that if we are a believer, which is (unintelligible). The messenger: You'll do that, too. But then, if there is, you know, remember the judge is needed when there is dispute.\r\n                            22:19\r\n                            The judge is needed when there is dispute. If the person knows what he's doing, you don't need a judge.\r\n                            22:24\r\n                            Maximum freedom is guaranteed in the Quran, also. Let's go to 66 and Lori. Anybody is saying something?\r\n                            22:35\r\n                            Yes. 66.\r\n                            22:44\r\n                            Lori: Verse 1. [66:1] O you prophet, why do you prohibit what GOD has made lawful for you, just to please your wives? GOD is Forgiver, Merciful.*\r\n                            22:54\r\n                            [66:2] GOD has decreed for you the laws dealing with your oaths. GOD is your Lord, and He is the Omniscient, Most Wise.\r\n                            23:00\r\n                            [66:3] The prophet had trusted some of his wives with a certain statement, then one of them spread it, and GOD let him know about it. He then informed his wife of part of the issue, and disregarded part. She asked him, \"Who informed you of this?\" He said, \"I was informed by the Omniscient, Most Cognizant.\"\r\n                            23:17\r\n                            [66:4] If the two of you repent to GOD, then your hearts have listened. But if you band together against him, then GOD is his ally, and so is Gabriel and the righteous believers. Also, the angels are his helpers.\r\n                            23:29\r\n                            [66:5] If he divorces you, his Lord will substitute other wives in your place who are better than you; submitters (Muslims), believers (Mu'mins), obedient, repentant, worshipers, pious, either previously married, or virgins.\r\n                            23:43\r\n                            [66:6] O you who believe, protect yourselves and your families from the Hellfire whose fuel is people and rocks. Guarding it are stern and powerful angels who never disobey GOD; they do whatever they are commanded to do.\r\n                            23:57\r\n                            [66:7] O you who disbelieved, do not apologize today. You are being requited only for what you did.\r\n                            24:04\r\n                            In the first verse of the Sura, in the footnote, it says that Mohammedans around the world believe that Muhammad was infallible. This verse teaches us that he was indeed a fallible human being.\r\n                            24:16\r\n                            And there are a number of verses cited that will back this up.\r\n                            24:24\r\n                            The messenger is given the responsibility to deliver the messages, and when he does that, he is\r\n                            24:31\r\n                            in accordance with God's laws and those things are preserved.\r\n                            24:38\r\n                            But the messenger is also a human being and is subject to the same test that everybody else is subject to, an even greater test, because with the responsibility comes, you know, the test.\r\n                            24:51\r\n                            And God made it this way so that we would not worship the messenger. That's God's system.\r\n                            24:58\r\n                            If the messenger was perfect, then he would be god.\r\n                            25:04\r\n                            So, it doesn't make any sense. The messengers are just humans. Their only job is to deliver the message, to clarify.\r\n                            25:11\r\n                            They are sent as a mercy from God to give the information to the rest of us. So, they're going to make mistakes.\r\n                            25:18\r\n                            And again, this is to weed out those who would turn away because the messenger isn't perfect. Do you know the history of Moses?\r\n                            25:29\r\n                            And he went to Pharaoh and Pharaoh said, you know, \"why should I listen to you? You stutter. You know, you're one of our slaves.\"\r\n                            25:36\r\n                            Even though, you know, Moses showed him all these miracles, it didn't make any difference.\r\n                            25:42\r\n                            But that was God's will. We have to believe God and now the messenger. And we know what happened.\r\n                            25:51\r\n                            The Christians, you know, who worshipped Jesus because it wasn't enough that he was a messenger. They wanted to make him a god besides God.\r\n                            26:00\r\n                            And it's the same thing with Muslims who worship Muhammad and they think that he was perfect. And there are all these myths and stories and legends about him that don't even make any sense. He was just a man.\r\n                            26:13\r\n                            And God is very careful in the Quran to point out his errors, too, not to scandalize him.\r\n                            26:20\r\n                            I mean, God doesn't get anything from that. But to make us realize that he was a man and don't worship him. He was just a man.\r\n                            26:25\r\n                            Listen to the message. It doesn't make any difference. The messengers all come with the same message, every one of them.\r\n                            26:33\r\n                            And it's God's intent that they do make mistakes and they are imperfect so that we won't worship them.\r\n                            26:41\r\n                            And to weed out those who will not listen to the messenger because they don't like him or they think that he's not perfect.\r\n                            26:56\r\n                            And the next verse is, again there isn't anything. I remember from one time in one of our discussions in Quranic study many, many years ago. There were some people from\r\n                            27:07\r\n                            another mosque and they were talking about the Hadith and Sunnah. The importance of it was because it was history.\r\n                            27:13\r\n                            And you know, if you read the Quran, the Quran is the greatest history.\r\n                            27:18\r\n                            We know what people think. We know what people thought. We know what they did under the tree and they got together and think that were in their mind. It's the greatest history.\r\n                            27:27\r\n                            And we know here about what happened to his wives. He just told them something and they went and spread it. I mean, this is God telling us this. And it's a lesson for all of us.\r\n                            27:38\r\n                            And we're not supposed to be mean. W. 're not supposed to gossip. We're not supposed to slander. You know, if something is entrusted to us, we're supposed to respect that and take heed.\r\n                            27:52\r\n                            And you can't hide from God. You know, she asked \"how did you know?\" And he said \"I know from God.\"\r\n                            27:58\r\n                            You can't get away from anything. God is Omnipotent. He's Omniscient. He told in verse 4 to repent and that the messenger is protected against these things.\r\n                            28:10\r\n                            And even if everybody banded together against him, God is saying that God is his ally and so are Gabriel and the righteous believers.\r\n                            28:20\r\n                            And as far as reasons for divorce, if he divorces you, you know, in this case because of the\r\n                            28:28\r\n                            their behavior, then God will make it up to him. He'll give him a better wife.\r\n                            28:34\r\n                            You know, what we were talking about earlier is that with difficulty there is ease. And if you\r\n                            28:40\r\n                            have to suffer in some way for the cause of God, it's always made up to you. You're always rewarded because God is the Most Gracious.\r\n                            28:49\r\n                            And in verse 6, we're admonished to protect ourselves and our families from the hellfire.\r\n                            28:55\r\n                            And how do we do that? We do it by, number one, being responsible for ourselves, obeying God's laws,\r\n                            29:03\r\n                            obeying the commandments, fulfilling all of our religious duties, but also think to it that our families do the same thing.\r\n                            29:11\r\n                            You know, parents have to make sure their children know how to do the Prayers,\r\n                            29:17\r\n                            make sure that the children do the Prayers when it's time for them to fast, to make sure that they fast.\r\n                            29:23\r\n                            Spouses have to, you know, help each other do the right thing. We're all... we all need to help each other because we all have the same weaknesses.\r\n                            29:35\r\n                            And we're told here that once we get to the Day of Judgment, there are angels who never disobey God.\r\n                            29:44\r\n                            And every command will be carried out and nobody will have any power to do anything else.\r\n                            29:53\r\n                            And on that day, we'll be told, well, God willing, not we, but those who disbelieve will be told not to apologize, that they're just being repaid for what they did.\r\n                            30:04\r\n                            Again, it all comes back to us. God has given us free will. The decision was ours.\r\n                            30:10\r\n                            Once we made that decision, He helped us along in whatever that decision was.\r\n                            30:15\r\n                            If we chose to disbelieve, He helped the disbelievers disbelieve. He actually leads them astray.\r\n                            30:23\r\n                            If this is their decision, then He helps them in that decision. If we choose to believe, then He helps us in our belief. He gives us the messages, the revelations, the steps to do what we have to do.\r\n                            30:37\r\n                            And God is just. We're only requited for what we did. We're not held responsible for anybody else's sins.\r\n                            30:45\r\n                            A wife is not held responsible for her husband's sins. You know, parents aren't held responsible for their children's sins. We have to be responsible for ourselves and everybody else...\r\n                            30:57\r\n                            Any questions or comments on this section?\r\n                            31:02\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible), can we go, should we go, as far as pursuing the kids, I don't know, to Praying, or fasting, or anything?\r\n                            31:18\r\n                            Lori: Well, obviously, you can only do so much. You can tell them to do it. You can set the example. You can make sure they do it up to a certain point.\r\n                            31:29\r\n                            But at some point, everybody is responsible for themselves. But, you know, if you want your children to get up and pray the Morning prayer,\r\n                            31:39\r\n                            and it's hard for them to do it, you might have to really work with them to do it. Maybe, not allow them to have their breakfast or something until they do their Morning prayer, or, you know.\r\n                            31:50\r\n                            Hamid: When you have children, and they are not responsible, I find it (unintelligible). If we go as far as waking them up, and lining them up and say \"well, pray.\"\r\n                            Enjoin children to do Salat.\r\n                            32:00\r\n                            The messenger: Do you have the translation, this translation with you? Hamid: The new one? The messenger: That's the one out here, you have there? Hamid: No.\r\n                            32:08\r\n                            The messenger: Okay, open page 218. That's the answer to your question. The old one, the book, 218, page 218.\r\n                            32:15\r\n                            Verse 132, it's very important, actually. This is Hamid's question, it's very important. Remember it, and do it.\r\n                            32:24\r\n                            What do you do with your children? Do you wanna read it for us, Hamid? Hamid: Pardon me? The messenger: Read verse 132.\r\n                            32:33\r\n                            Hamid: 132. [20:132] You shall enjoin your family to observe the contact prayers (Salat), and steadfastly persevere in doing so. We do not ask you for any provisions; we are the ones who provide for you. The ultimate triumph belongs to the righteous.\r\n                            32:52\r\n                            The messenger: Well, there's the answer to your question. It says \"you order them, exhort them to pray and persist in doing so.\"\r\n                            32:59\r\n                            Now, because you're doing God's commandment, God controls your heart and their hearts, and everything will go just wonderful.\r\n                            33:05\r\n                            But you just have to exhort them. You have to keep telling them. My children are grown up now, but when they were young, I would ask them.\r\n                            33:14\r\n                            They're willing to do the prayers, but I had to remind them every day. If I...\r\n                            33:19\r\n                            If I don't carry out God's commandment, and I wait until two in the afternoon and ask them \"did you pray the Noon?\"\r\n                            33:25\r\n                            \"No, we'll go pray.\" So, but there were no problems. Here's one of them.\r\n                            33:34\r\n                            Hamid: They were under your umbrella, economically. The messenger: Yes. Hamid: But you didn't actually give them a choice. Taking the circumstances into account, they didn't have a choice. The messenger: Yes, they did. Yes, they did.\r\n                            33:51\r\n                            The messenger: They could have said \"no, we're not gonna do it.\" But they didn't. It just didn't come up.\r\n                            33:56\r\n                            I always said \"let's pray.\" And they prayed. Like I said, God controls the whole situation.\r\n                            34:02\r\n                            You just do your part, and God will do the rest. Hamid: But I can't really go along with this decision. We are not in control. The messenger: Don't. You don't have to.\r\n                            34:12\r\n                            Hamid: No, I realize... every time I come here, you say, well, \"this life is pre-recorded, and we have absolutely no power, decision-making power, and we are not responsible because everything is pre-recorded.\"\r\n                            34:33\r\n                            The messenger: I didn't say that, but it's..., go ahead. Hamid: I believe, I think every day you come to make decisions. You have to make a decision. You have to pass a judgment. The messenger: Right.\r\n                            34:42\r\n                            Hamid: And you are... The messenger: Okay, your question is \"what do I do with my children,\" right? Hamid: Right.\r\n                            34:48\r\n                            The messenger: The answer is right there in verse 132. It says \"you exhort them to pray and persist in doing so.\"\r\n                            34:54\r\n                            Hamid: But at that point, I'm saying, can you really say that? The messenger: What else are you gonna do?\r\n                            35:02\r\n                            The messenger: What? I mean, why are you being negative? Why don't you... are you assuming that they will say no, right?\r\n                            35:08\r\n                            Hamid: I'm playing the...\r\n                            35:16\r\n                            Hamid: I'm saying the guy says \"I don't wanna pray.\" The messenger: Well, no...\r\n                            35:22\r\n                            The messenger: If they say that, then come back and ask me the question. But I say \"when you do your part, they will...\" because this is what... this has been my experience.\r\n                            35:30\r\n                            Hamid: But do you leave the choice to him or not? The messenger: Yes. Hamid: So, if he has a choice to say \"well, I ain't gonna pray.\" The messenger: Absolutely. But they never said \"no.\"\r\n                            35:41\r\n                            You have to keep saying... I mean, it's just, it just never came up that they said \"no, we're not gonna pray.\"\r\n                            35:52\r\n                            The messenger: Those circumstances will not happen if you carry out God's commandment. Brothers and sisters, we are living experience, okay? It is, we speak from experience God provided.\r\n                            36:02\r\n                            Not just my experience, all our experiences. I raised two kids, right? One of them is right there. They're all grown up now.\r\n                            36:09\r\n                            But, throughout their life, I carried out this commandment. I told them to pray.\r\n                            36:14\r\n                            And it was never, never once did they say \"no, we're not praying.\" We didn't have... it just didn't come up.\r\n                            36:21\r\n                            So, what I'm saying is \"you just do the, do the commandment that God gave you, and everything goes fine.\"\r\n                            36:28\r\n                            However, if I was lax in doing this commandment, if I'm not persisting in doing it, they will go without prayer.\r\n                            36:37\r\n                            So, I will ask them, I tell them to pray, and they wait three or four days. And if I don't say pray, I will notice that they, they passed up the time for prayer.\r\n                            36:45\r\n                            Hamid: Well, as much as I admire your children, and I agree with what, basically what you said, but still, in our lives, there are points, there are certain times that they reject\r\n                            37:00\r\n                            even the God. Even we reject it, say \"well, I have some doubt.\"\r\n                            37:05\r\n                            The messenger: You're, you're entitled to do that. Hamid: Well, you, okay, that's, that, those are the, actually, the points I was making my argument.\r\n                            37:12\r\n                            The messenger: You're talking about you or the children? Hamid: Well, anybody. Haven't you ever doubt God? The messenger: Me? Hamid: In your, in your evolution?\r\n                            37:21\r\n                            The messenger: I don't think I ever did. The messenger: But, but, I wasn't right the whole time. I was an idol worshiper for a long time. But I never doubted God.\r\n                            37:30\r\n                            However, anybody is entitled to doubt God, or question God, or be an atheist. So am I. I mean, but it just, it just happened that I didn't.\r\n                            37:41\r\n                            The messenger: Okay. So, let's take a time when you doubt God. You say \"God doesn't exist.\" Hamid: Ok. Therefore, you're not gonna pray. The messenger: Right. Nor are you going to carry this commandment. You're gonna... you will not do this commandment.\r\n                            37:53\r\n                            The messenger: Your life will be a mess. Hamid: Not necessarily. The messenger: Oh, yes, necessarily. Hamid: No, if you doubt God.... The messenger: It's in the same Sura, the same Sura...\r\n                            38:07\r\n                            Hamid: Well, let me, while you're finding that, let me remind people that God... The messenger: Tell her to keep them for 20 more minutes, we'll pay her more. Yeah.\r\n                            38:18\r\n                            Hamid: God's law as I understand... The messenger: See, there is a law, Hamid, let me give you the Quranic law, Okay. God says \"you follow my laws, you're gonna have a happy life.\r\n                            38:28\r\n                            You disregard my message, you're gonna have a miserable life.\" This is what God says. Hamid: Exactly. The messenger: So, there is no way around it.\r\n                            38:35\r\n                            Hamid: He is the authority. He gave you the mind which He never gave to none of His creatures. The messenger: Right. So, when...\r\n                            38:41\r\n                            Hamid: And that is the choice that in your lifetime you are going to make, back and forth.\r\n                            38:50\r\n                            The messenger: Okay. Hamid: You get to as close as you can get to Him. In this process, as we just noticed, like yourself, you were atheist or I, in my....\r\n                            39:01\r\n                            The messenger: No, I was not an atheist. I was never an atheist. I never doubted God. No.\r\n                            39:06\r\n                            The messenger: Hamid, I don't like the fact that you ask a question and then we go on to other things. Now, your question was\r\n                            39:11\r\n                            \"what do I do with the children,\" right? I gave you the answer from the Quran.\r\n                            39:17\r\n                            Quran is \"you exhort them to follow the commandment and persist in doing so.\" This is your part.\r\n                            39:24\r\n                            If we're gonna go into other philosophical questions, it goes into something else. So, let's wait until the occasion comes up\r\n                            39:30\r\n                            Just for the sake of the people, just for the sake of the other people, so. Yeah, Susan what's...\r\n                            39:38\r\n                            Susan: We can look at the kids in our own lives. Well, I mean, I'm always, you know, (unintelligible) and I are reminded to pray. Then, she wants to get up on her own. We don't even have to tell her anything. She wants to get up to pray. She does her prayers smooth.\r\n                            39:55\r\n                            And there are other kids, you know, (unintelligible). We have kids, you know, Aisha Baruni passed the today's...\r\n                            40:05\r\n                            The messenger: Mã Shã Allãh. A woman: 8 years old. Susan: Sarah wants to pass tomorrow. A man: Cool. That doesn't happen, like me, Ok. I have a little sister. I tell her to pray and come to the mosque. She doesn't wanna come, but I keep saying to her.\r\n                            40:18\r\n                            I think someday she'll come here. The messenger: Yes, you bet.\r\n                            40:28\r\n                            The messenger: if you watch our children here in the mosque, you see them eagerly and joyfully praying. They join the prayers. So, it's no problem.\r\n                            40:36\r\n                            Hamid: Doctor, I was just mentioning the choice. I was just emphasizing on that, underlining that. A kid's choice lives up to the adult. They can make their own decision even though it's not agreeing with my own as their guardian.\r\n                            40:53\r\n                            The messenger: See, it is your duty to do this commandment. Ok. Hamid: Just pass the message to them and leave it up to them, if they wanna follow it up, or if they wanna fail. The messenger: That's right.\r\n                            41:04\r\n                            The messenger: That's right. But it is your responsibility and your job to point out to them why they should pray, why is it necessary.\r\n                            41:11\r\n                            You see, it is your obligation. You have duties towards your children and your family.\r\n                            41:18\r\n                            You can't just come out of nowhere and say \"get up and pray.\" They're gonna tell you \"why?\"\r\n                            41:23\r\n                            You see, I mean, it's a whole life story that you're doing. You're carrying out God's commandments.\r\n                            41:34\r\n                            From all... Beth? Beth: I just wanna make it clear to you that Sam and I are no exception, because, I mean, when we were real little, we prayed because we felt so guilty when you asked us to pray,\r\n                            41:46\r\n                            I don't wanna lie. So, I mean, that was the only reason we prayed. And then when we got a little older, if we didn't wanna pray, we didn't pray.\r\n                            41:54\r\n                            You know, I mean, it just wasn't something that was important to us, and even for a long time we missed it.\r\n                            42:00\r\n                            You know, we missed the Friday prayers and the Quranic studies, and I mean, he didn't argue with us. I mean, he told us, you know, what we should do, but, you know, he didn't punish us if we didn't do it.\r\n                            42:12\r\n                            And it just came to the point when we got a little older that we found out for ourselves, you know, what was the best, what the best thing was for us.\r\n                            42:21\r\n                            And it just comes to you in your heart. Your parents can't interfere with what's between you and God, and I thi. k it comes to a certain age where you find out for yourself.\r\n                            42:31\r\n                            The messenger: Actually, if you punish them, they'll hate it. You don't want them to hate religion and prayer and all that.\r\n                            42:37\r\n                            See, all you need to do... The messenger: All you need to do is carry out, you do your part.\r\n                            42:45\r\n                            And this is at the beginning of the Quran, God says \"you do your part, I'll do my part.\"\r\n                            42:52\r\n                            A woman: Is that a good idea, Rashad? The messenger: What? You say the Prayer. A woman: You tell them \"OK, time to get up for prayer.\" And then I went for jumping up there.\r\n                            42:59\r\n                            But he did say the prayers out loud, so they have to hear it anyway? The messenger: Whatever you need to do to carry out the commandments, God says here.\r\n                            43:07\r\n                            A woman: ...when I'm to start Prayer is too loud or too quiet though? The messenger: No, she doesn't mean loud, real loud, you know. Just audible, she means audible.\r\n                            43:20\r\n                            OK, where are we now? Lori: Verse 8.\r\n                            43:29\r\n                            The messenger: Verse 8. The messenger: Let's finish Sura 66.\r\n                            43:38\r\n                            Lori: OK, we're on verse 8. The Believers Repent. [66:8] O you who believe, you shall repent to GOD a firm rep...\r\n                            43:49\r\n                            The messenger: A firm repentance. Did you read this before? Lori: No? No. OK. The messenger: OK.\r\n                            43:56\r\n                            Lori: [66:8] O you who believe, you shall... Lori: [66:9] O prophet, struggle against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be stern with them. Their abode is Gehenna, and a miserable destiny.\r\n                            44:09\r\n                            In verse 8, we're told here to repent, because repentance is our chance.\r\n                            44:15\r\n                            Every day, every hour, we have the opportunity to repent, to wipe out our sins, and to start new again.\r\n                            44:22\r\n                            God has given that to us. So, what Hamid was saying earlier that it's a daily decision to stay in God's Kingdom.\r\n                            44:29\r\n                            And He knows that we make mistakes. He knows that we break His commandments.\r\n                            44:37\r\n                            And He gives us a chance to overcome that by repentance.\r\n                            44:43\r\n                            And if we do repent, and sincerely repent, which means you don't ever do it again.\r\n                            44:49\r\n                            And you really try to change. Then, God will remit your sins, and admit you into gardens of flowing streams, you in the Hereafter.\r\n                            44:59\r\n                            On that day, God will not disappoint the prophet and those who believe with him. We've been given a promise by God that if we do our part, which is what we were just talking about earlier. If we do our part, God does His part.\r\n                            45:12\r\n                            And we've talked about this before, there is no better guarantee or warranty than God's.\r\n                            45:18\r\n                            This is proven. We don't have to worry about it. If we do our part, God will do His part.\r\n                            45:27\r\n                            In the Bible, we've talked about the verses in Luke where it says \"Seek God's Kingship over you and all else follow.\" That's all you have to do.\r\n                            45:34\r\n                            It's just do your part and everything else falls into place. And the light will radiate in front of them and to their right.\r\n                            45:42\r\n                            And we know that the light is knowledge, the presence of God. We don't want to be in the darkness. And one of the reasons for the messenger being sent to us is to help us out of the darkness and into the light.\r\n                            45:54\r\n                            That's one of God's mercies. The light is mentioned many, many times in the Quran.\r\n                            46:01\r\n                            And if you just think about it, it's a wonderful allegory because in the darkness, you're lost,\r\n                            46:07\r\n                            you can't see. There's fear, confusion. And when you leave that into the light, then everything is made apparent to you. You know what's going on. There's no more fear.\r\n                            46:22\r\n                            And there's some verses in the Quran that on the Day of Judgment, the disbelievers who have been\r\n                            46:29\r\n                            destined for Hell will beg for some of that light. They'll be in eternal darkness.\r\n                            46:35\r\n                            And the believers will ask God to perfect that light for them and to forgive them and acknowledge that God is Omnipotent.\r\n                            46:45\r\n                            And in verse 9, it's an admonition to the prophet, but again to all of us, to struggle\r\n                            46:53\r\n                            against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh with them. A lot of times, people misunderstand what we do in this mosque.\r\n                            47:02\r\n                            They think that because we say the things that we say, that we're being very unfair, we're being very harsh, we're closed-minded, we're...\r\n                            47:13\r\n                            and some of the other things, they think, but you're right. This is what God is telling us to do because it's our responsibility.\r\n                            47:20\r\n                            It's the responsibility of those who have the knowledge to give it to others, okay, and to fight because it's not your fight, it's God's fight.\r\n                            47:28\r\n                            And if God, you know, sensitizes the disbelievers, that doesn't mean you go out and you do anything\r\n                            47:35\r\n                            necessarily violent, but there's ways to struggle with the truth.\r\n                            47:42\r\n                            Rashad publishes from this mosque the...\r\n                            47:48\r\n                            The messenger: Muslim Perspective. Lori: And some of the things that are said in there... The messenger: It's fasting, Lori. It's fasting does that.\r\n                            47:56\r\n                            Lori: Oh, right. I don't know. The messenger: Go ahead. And the things that are said in there are really profound, and they just get everybody upset, you know, but they have to be said.\r\n                            Believers make mistakes – be Stern with disbelievers so they “don’t fall in the ditch”.\r\n                            48:06\r\n                            It has to be said for those who might choose to listen to it. They have the right to hear God's messages, and they have the right to have the message clarified for them, whether they're leaders, like it or not.\r\n                            48:19\r\n                            It's everybody's right to have that, and it's a constant struggle.\r\n                            48:26\r\n                            And when you think about it, you're really doing them a favor, because if there's any chance that they might hear and listen and repent, then they'll be spared that terrible destiny of Hell.\r\n                            48:36\r\n                            So, it's for their own good even though they dislike it. That's just human nature.\r\n                            48:45\r\n                            Lori: Do you want me to go on? The messenger: Yeah, let's finish this. Lori: Okay. The messenger: Let me just comment since...\r\n                            48:50\r\n                            The messenger: It's very important to notice in verse 8 that it says \"O you who believe, repent to God a sincere repentance.\"\r\n                            49:00\r\n                            This is directed to the believers, because the believers make mistakes.\r\n                            49:06\r\n                            And the disbelievers, that's a hopeless case, but it is the believers who repent and strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites.\r\n                            49:17\r\n                            It's for their own good, like Lori said. In another Sura, God says, in fact, it's Sura 4, it happens to be. God says \"here you are defending them in this life. Who's gonna be their advocate in the Hereafter?\"\r\n                            49:30\r\n                            So, it is to their own good that if somebody's gonna fall in a ditch, that you hold them by their clothes and shake him up.\r\n                            49:38\r\n                            Be stern, otherwise they'll fall in the ditch. The messenger: Okay, go ahead. Lori: The Myth of Intercession Shattered\r\n                            49:46\r\n                            [66:10] GOD cites as examples of those who disbelieved the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot. They were married to two of our righteous servants, but they betrayed them and, consequently, they could not help them at all against GOD. The two of them were told, \"Enter the Hellfire with those who deserved it.\"\r\n                            50:02\r\n                            Examples of the Believers Pharaoh's Wife [66:11] And GOD cites as an example of those who believed the wife of Pharaoh. She said, \"My Lord, build a home for me at You in Paradise, and save me from Pharaoh and his works; save me from the transgressing people.\"\r\n                            50:16\r\n                            Mary [66:12] Also Mary, the Amramite. She maintained her chastity, then we blew into her from our spirit. She believed in the words of her Lord and His scriptures; she was obedient.\r\n                            50:27\r\n                            We're told here that there is no such thing as intercession, that each one of us is responsible for our own actions.\r\n                            50:35\r\n                            Here are the wives of Noah and the wives of Lot. Okay, they were prophets. They were righteous, and it doesn't make any difference.\r\n                            50:45\r\n                            Their husbands cannot intercede on their behalf. Nobody can intercede on their behalf. They're going to Hell because of their actions, for rejecting the messages that the messengers brought, even though they were their husbands. It didn't make any difference.\r\n                            51:02\r\n                            The messenger: Sorry about that. Lori: That's okay. Lori: And that's very specific. And then in the next verses, it's the opposite.\r\n                            51:10\r\n                            Pharaoh, who was, you know, God just said the most wicked person on earth. He was just so evil and wicked and just transgressed on earth,\r\n                            51:18\r\n                            and this woman was married to him, and it didn't make any difference. She was there. She was stuck in that situation. She couldn't leave, but it didn't make any difference. She believed, and her prayer was for God to give her a place at paradise.\r\n                            51:33\r\n                            You know, and it's okay. You can believe under any circumstances, and she's an example for us.\r\n                            51:40\r\n                            And Mary, the mother of Jesus, she held up as an example for all the women. She went through incredible tests.\r\n                            51:51\r\n                            I mean, you know, to have a son and a messenger and all of these things that she had to go through.\r\n                            51:59\r\n                            And she, in her time, she was an example. She maintained her chastity, and she believed in God's word. She didn't doubt Him.\r\n                            52:08\r\n                            When the angel came and said \"you're going to have a child.\" And she said \"how can I have a child? No man has touched me.\"\r\n                            52:15\r\n                            And, you know, what a thing. Just think of it were you, and this happened to you. I mean, you know, talk about panic, and just, you know, and she didn't.\r\n                            52:23\r\n                            She just persevered, and she did what she had to do.\r\n                            52:30\r\n                            The messenger: And in those days \"you're pregnant, kid.\" Lori: It was a terrible thing that she had to go through. And she was accused of terrible things, and, you know, she just persevered and was steadfast, and she will have her reward.\r\n                            52:43\r\n                            I mean, she is cited as an example for all time, to all people, as an example of a believer.\r\n                            52:49\r\n                            What better reward for her that she, you know, has this place in God's history.\r\n                            52:59\r\n                            Lori: IN SHAA ALLAH. The messenger: IN SHAA ALLAH. Good job, as usual. God bless you. Congratulations.\r\n                            Reciting the Key for Birthdays.\r\n                            53:05\r\n                            The messenger: We have to... Ben, Ben, sit down. Hey, hey, hey. We're not done yet.\r\n                            53:14\r\n                            The messenger: We're gonna recite Al-Fãtehah twice today. First, Farhad Moini's birthday will be Thursday. So, we're gonna celebrate\r\n                            53:22\r\n                            today and next Friday, IN SHAA ALLAH, because it's closer to his birthday. But we're gonna grab this chance to recite Al-Fãtehah, so God will give him and his wonderful family\r\n                            53:31\r\n                            a great year coming up, and every year to be greater than the previous year, IN SHAA ALLAH.\r\n                            53:36\r\n                            God never turns us down.

The messenger: Sura 26 prohibits reading Quran in Arabic for non-Arabic people.\r\n                            0:50\r\n                            The messenger: Sura 26. Edip: What?! 26? The messenger: You didn't know that?\r\n                            0:58\r\n                            The messenger: Alhamdu lillah. He knows everything, that's why.\r\n                            1:04\r\n                            Yeah. Sura 26, remember this. It says do not... prohibits the reading of Quran in the language other than what the people understand.\r\n                            1:14\r\n                            Because it says, in fact it says, no it doesn't say that.\r\n                            1:21\r\n                            I was gonna say it sounds Chinese to them. It sounds like a different... God says \"they will not be blamed if they don't believe if you read it to them in a different language.\r\n                            1:32\r\n                            Ok, back to Edip. Edip: [70:1] A questioner may question the inevitable retribution. [70:2] For the disbelievers, none can stop it.\r\n                            1:44\r\n                            [70:3] From GOD; Possessor of the highest Height. The messenger: Height. Edip: Height.\r\n                            1:50\r\n                            Edip: [70:4] The angels, with their reports, climb to Him in a day that equals fifty thousand years.\r\n                            2:06\r\n                            This question has always been questioned to every messenger about the Last Day, about the end of the world.\r\n                            2:18\r\n                            And always people has been ridiculed this day, but in the future, when we be close to the end of the world, for example, about 200 or 250 years later,\r\n                            2:39\r\n                            this question will be very widespread and everybody will ask this question.\r\n                            2:46\r\n                            And millions or billions of Muslims will discuss this subject with disbelievers.\r\n                            2:53\r\n                            And all verses about the end of the world will become a real fact and the believers will know the end of the world and the unbelievers will ridicule this, will mock at them.\r\n                            3:12\r\n                            And they will create a great dispute between believers and unbelievers.\r\n                            3:21\r\n                            But we now also discuss this matter and when we say the end of the world will be in that time, unbelievers will ridicule us.\r\n                            3:39\r\n                            They will ask when. Here, God, our God, gives us the relativity of the time.\r\n                            3:54\r\n                            He says a day, a day of your, a day of Heaven, Divinely day is equal to 50,000 years, your years.\r\n                            4:13\r\n                            In other words, we see that it may be 1,000 years.\r\n                            4:18\r\n                            These two different scales show us that time is not absolute, it is relative.\r\n                            4:31\r\n                            For example, I think everything is relative to us. For example, heat is relative to our heat.\r\n                            4:45\r\n                            We have 37 Celsius degree. If the weather is more than this, it is heat to us.\r\n                            4:55\r\n                            But if less than this, it is cold to us, the weather. For example, the density of our meat, what do you say, flesh, the density of our flesh,\r\n                            5:16\r\n                            it has a density. Edip: And if we touch something that has more density, we say it is hard, solid. The messenger: Solid.\r\n                            5:26\r\n                            Edip: And if less than it, we say it is soft. Edip: And we compare, we compare with, we get information about our environment by our possessions, The messenger: Standards. Edip: Standards, yes, thank you.\r\n                            5:47\r\n                            And also our standard is our life. We live about 70 years in this world.\r\n                            5:55\r\n                            Our scale is this 70 years. A fly, the standard of a fly is 3 months, about 3 months.\r\n                            6:04\r\n                            3 months of a fly is equals our 50 years.\r\n                            6:13\r\n                            The messenger: How old are dogs, Lydia? The messenger: The oldest one is how old? In human life is?\r\n                            6:24\r\n                            Ok. So, this is what Edip means. So, the dogs escape.\r\n                            6:32\r\n                            Edip: And here, in the verse 4, there is a word that has 2 or 4 meanings, 2 or 3 meanings.\r\n                            6:44\r\n                            Word RUH (روح). It has been translated as report, reports, or revelation.\r\n                            6:53\r\n                            In Quran, we can find these words used for revelation, or for Gabriel (جِبْرِيلَ), an angel.\r\n                            Role of Angel Gabriel – explanation of theory of relativity – Angels speed – Speed of light is Slow.\r\n                            7:05\r\n                            It has both 2 meanings. And here, Rashad has translated it as \"their reports.\"\r\n                            7:21\r\n                            Do you have any questions about these 4 verses?\r\n                            7:27\r\n                            Edip: May I? The messenger: I think we should point out here that Gabriel is the only, this is his only job, and he is the only one who does the job of carrying revelations from God to the world.\r\n                            7:38\r\n                            Any new information, or new revelations, something that was never known before, comes from God to this world through Gabriel.\r\n                            7:48\r\n                            So, this is why one of his names is the spirit, or the revelation.\r\n                            7:57\r\n                            Because when God says \"I blew into Adam from My spirit, it's a word.\" Jesus called the word a word from God, because he was created by a word.\r\n                            8:08\r\n                            \"Be\" a word from God. \"Be\" and he was. The same with Adam. And Gabriel brought that word to Mary, if you remember.\r\n                            8:17\r\n                            So, here the angels go to the first universe, carrying reports about things happening here, as well. So...\r\n                            8:31\r\n                            And we're given the relative speed. You know, just like Lydia said \"the dog is 10 years, but in human terms, it would be 60 years.\"\r\n                            8:42\r\n                            We're told here that if you travel a distance in one day, the angels.... in 50,000 years, the angels will cut it in one day.\r\n                            8:51\r\n                            In Carl Sagan's last novel, he concluded that the speed of light is very slow.\r\n                            9:00\r\n                            It really is, because nothing will be done in the universe if things were happening at the speed of light.\r\n                            9:06\r\n                            Our favorite example here is the Prophet Muhammad's ascension to the first universe.\r\n                            9:12\r\n                            If he were traveling at the speed of light, he would still be in one hundredth of the Milky Way galaxy and still be going on his way.\r\n                            9:21\r\n                            Of course, that did not happen. He went and came in the same night. God took him up in the same night.\r\n                            9:29\r\n                            Edip: There is a famous equation about the relativity of the light. And according to this equation, when you exceed the speed of light, there is no time.\r\n                            9:41\r\n                            The time becomes zero. The messenger: So, this is the theory of relativity, for instance.\r\n                            9:48\r\n                            If you travel at the speed of light, time disappears.\r\n                            9:54\r\n                            If you travel faster than the speed of light, you can go into the negative. Edip: It's wrong.\r\n                            10:01\r\n                            Edip: It may be wrong. The messenger: No, not wrong. The messenger: Let us say... Let me explain it very quickly.\r\n                            10:09\r\n                            Our pictures travel at the speed of light. If you turn the light on, I will see it at the speed of light.\r\n                            10:16\r\n                            So the person, Mahmoud, will see this later than me, because there is a fraction of a second.\r\n                            10:21\r\n                            So, once I turn this light on, I will see it first and Mahmoud will see it, because it is traveling at the speed of light.\r\n                            10:28\r\n                            Our pictures travel at the speed of light. If the sun is turned off for a second, we will see this after 8 minutes, because it will take 8 minutes for the light. So,\r\n                            10:41\r\n                            the picture of anything travels at the speed of light. So, let's say Edip scratched his ear and then sneezed.\r\n                            10:50\r\n                            Scratched his ear and then sneezed. Now this, somebody has taken a picture from a mile away. Let's say somebody can take a picture from a mile away.\r\n                            11:00\r\n                            When he scratched his ear, after a fraction of a second, the camera will see that and take a picture,\r\n                            11:07\r\n                            because his picture is traveling at the speed of light. Yes? So, at the speed of light from here to there, it will take a certain amount of time,\r\n                            11:16\r\n                            and then after that he would sneeze. So, let us say I am here and I'm gonna travel with this picture at the speed of light.\r\n                            11:23\r\n                            So, if he's scratching his ear and I'm traveling with that picture at the speed of light, I will always see him frozen in that position there.\r\n                            11:31\r\n                            This makes sense? Because I'm traveling with him at the speed of light, that picture will be still. So now,\r\n                            11:38\r\n                            Oh, let's say he sneezed before he scratched his ear. So, if I go faster now at the speed of light, I will see his picture when he sneezed before that.\r\n                            11:50\r\n                            Did I confuse everybody? So, I'm traveling with him at the speed as he was scratching his ear.\r\n                            11:57\r\n                            So, but if I travel faster than the speed of light, I will see his picture when he sneezed, which was a few seconds before he scratched his ear.\r\n                            12:04\r\n                            So, I go in the past, because I'm going faster than the speed of light.\r\n                            12:09\r\n                            If I go even faster than that, I will see him put his glasses on, which is something that happened before he scratched his ear.\r\n                            12:16\r\n                            So, let's say even if I walked in the room as he was scratching his ear and then I take off with his picture at the speed of light, I will see what happened in the past before I came into the room.\r\n                            12:28\r\n                            Edip: Rashad... The messenger: This is how I'm trying to simplify it. I have complicated it.\r\n                            12:34\r\n                            Edip: Let me... The messenger: But this is what... if you go at the speed of light, then time will stand still.\r\n                            12:40\r\n                            I will always see him holding his... If I travel at the speed of light, time stands still.\r\n                            12:48\r\n                            Yes, if I go faster, I will see what he did before I came into the room. The messenger: He sneezed, he put his glasses on, whatever happened before. Edip: May I give you an example?\r\n                            12:58\r\n                            The messenger: Okay, confuse us more.\r\n                            13:05\r\n                            Edip: 100s... 1,400 years, light years far away from us, that thing star. There are many stars that are far away, farther away.\r\n                            13:18\r\n                            From this star, let's think that there is a civilization or we went there. Just now, we are there. And\r\n                            13:27\r\n                            we are taking the photo of this earth with a very sophisticated telescope and detailed,\r\n                            13:35\r\n                            we could get the picture of people, persons. And we could take the picture of Muhammad and the battle of BADR from that star.\r\n                            13:48\r\n                            Edip: It is possible, but impossible. The messenger: Yes, those pictures are traveling in space now. Edip: Yes. Edip: Because, just it will... The messenger: To reach that star only now. Edip: Yes, only now.\r\n                            13:59\r\n                            The messenger: Things, that were happening on earth 1400 years ago, are reaching objects in heaven that are 1400 light years away.\r\n                            14:08\r\n                            It's true. The messenger: Also, if that star explodes right now, we will not see it for 1400 years. Edip: Yes.\r\n                            14:15\r\n                            The messenger: Because that's how long it will take for the speed of light to come here. The speed of light is very slow.\r\n                            14:22\r\n                            And what we're told here in verse 4, that the angels travel, what we spend 50,000 years traveling, our maximum speed, the speed of light, the angels will do it in one day.\r\n                            14:41\r\n                            And by the way, this is not a fixed relationship, because it can be different.\r\n                            14:47\r\n                            It depends on where you are in the universe. For example, you go to the moon, your day will be 14 of our days.\r\n                            14:55\r\n                            This is something we can do now. We can go to the moon. And you're gonna have 14 of our days in continuous day light.\r\n                            15:02\r\n                            And then 14 nights. 14 days that equal one night on the moon. If you go to Jupiter, you're gonna have 365 days of light. The day equals one of our years.\r\n                            15:15\r\n                            And even on earth, if you go to Alaska, you're gonna have 6 months day. No, but this is different. So, it depends on where you are in the universe, that our day is different compared to their day.\r\n                            15:29\r\n                            Back to Edip. Edip: Verse 5, [70:5] Therefore, you shall resort to a gracious patience.\r\n                            15:38\r\n                            You must be patient. \"A gracious patience.\" [70:6] For they see it far away.\r\n                            15:45\r\n                            [70:7] While we see it very close. [70:8] The day will come when the sky will be like molten rocks.\r\n                            15:54\r\n                            will be like lava. [70:9] The mountains will be like fluffy wool.\r\n                            16:00\r\n                            [70:10] No friend will care about his close friend.\r\n                            16:05\r\n                            [70:11] When they see them, the guilty will wish he could give his own children as ransom, to spare him the retribution of that day.\r\n                            16:16\r\n                            [70:12] Also his spouse, and his brother. [70:13] Even his whole tribe that raised him.\r\n                            16:24\r\n                            [70:14] Even all the people on earth, if it would save him.\r\n                            16:32\r\n                            Here, we see the horror of that day, that people will give up from everything that he likes, he loves.\r\n                            16:46\r\n                            But that day there is no ransom.\r\n                            Those who gave up God for their children\\spouse in this world would give them up to spare them the retribution.\r\n                            17:01\r\n                            And also this describes the selfishness of disbelievers.\r\n                            17:06\r\n                            They are selfish and they will want to change everything, to give as a ransom everything that they love, that they have.\r\n                            17:17\r\n                            The messenger: They probably gave up God in this world for the sake of their spouse or parents or children or whatever.\r\n                            17:25\r\n                            The messenger: But on the Day of Judgment, they want to give up those people. Edip: The love of disbelievers, when they love something, their love is because of their selfishness.\r\n                            17:37\r\n                            They love, for example, their children because they have benefit.\r\n                            17:46\r\n                            They do not love anything, they don't expect benefit.\r\n                            17:52\r\n                            For example, they do not do anything secretly, good things, because they are in fact selfish.\r\n                            18:02\r\n                            But apparently, they may not see it. Any people who do not believe in Hereafter, they are selfish in this world.\r\n                            18:17\r\n                            Let's go on, 15. [70:15] No; it is aflame.\r\n                            18:23\r\n                            [70:16] Eager to burn. [70:17] It calls on those who turned away.\r\n                            18:30\r\n                            [70:18] Those who hoarded and counted. [70:19] Indeed, the human being is anxious.\r\n                            18:40\r\n                            Verse 17 tells us that Hell will call, will invite people.\r\n                            18:52\r\n                            In Quran, we find that Allah personalized the substances.\r\n                            19:02\r\n                            Understand? For example, in chapter 41, verse 21, we see, God makes everything speak up. Makes everything speak up\r\n                            19:18\r\n                            For example, in 41:11, we see earth and heaven speak. In chapter 23, verse 62, the record speaks.\r\n                            19:28\r\n                            And chapter 50, verse 30, Hell speaks. And chapter 27, verse 82, computer speaks.\r\n                            19:40\r\n                            God makes everything speak up. But what is speaking in our language?\r\n                            19:45\r\n                            Speaking, you may understand speaking is only by words.\r\n                            19:51\r\n                            But Quran explains the word \"speaking.\"\r\n                            19:56\r\n                            The word \"speak\", in 3:41, we see gesture, symbols, also is another way for speaking.\r\n                            20:09\r\n                            Allah says for Zakariya (Zachariah), your sign is not to speak with anybody for three days except\r\n                            20:19\r\n                            except gestures, by symbols you just speak. Exceptions show us that symbols or anything that symbol gestures are also a way of speaking.\r\n                            20:33\r\n                            The messenger: Signals. Edip: Signals, yes.\r\n                            20:41\r\n                            Edip: Verse 18, [70:18] Those who hoarded and counted. is one of the important character of disbelievers.\r\n                            20:51\r\n                            They hoarded and... verse says \"they (unintelligible)\" And they are so... they are very careful about the substances of this world.\r\n                            21:09\r\n                            And also we can see this character in chapter 74, verse 12, 15.\r\n                            21:20\r\n                            And verse 19 is very interesting. [70:19] Indeed, the human being is anxious.\r\n                            21:30\r\n                            In Arabic, we see it has been created as anxious.\r\n                            21:38\r\n                            The word is \"has been created.\" I search about this because Allah says in chapter 95, verse 4, 5.\r\n                            21:51\r\n                            (95:4) لَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ فِىٓ أَحْسَنِ تَقْوِيمٍۢ [95:4] We created man in the best design.\r\n                            22:02\r\n                            Allah, in another verse, please open chapter 32, verse 7.\r\n                            22:20\r\n                            He perfected everything He created. He perfected everything He created. Allah's creation is perfect.\r\n                            22:27\r\n                            But here we see that human being has been created anxious.\r\n                            22:35\r\n                            Apparently, we may see a contradiction between those verses.\r\n                            22:43\r\n                            But if we carefully research on the word KHALAQA (خَلَقَ), we see in Quran, when God say about our creation,\r\n                            22:55\r\n                            when mention about our creation, He says, خَلَقْنَا , خَلَقْنَا ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ, we created.\r\n                            23:02\r\n                            And Allah, when mention about His creation, He says always to create in best manner.\r\n                            23:10\r\n                            But here it is KHULIQA (خُلِقَ), has been created. Not we created.\r\n                            23:17\r\n                            How do you say in English for this? KHULIQA (خُلِقَ). Unknown. The subject is unknown here.\r\n                            23:25\r\n                            The messenger: Passive. It's passive tense. Edip: Passive. Yes. Passive Tense. For example, we can see the passive tense in chapter 4, verse 28.\r\n                            23:34\r\n                            It describes the weakness of human being, خُلِقَ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنُ\r\n                            23:39\r\n                            You can see that verse. And also the human being has been created hasty, chapter 21, verse 38.\r\n                            23:50\r\n                            And when Allah describes the weakness and anxiousness and hastiness of the human being,\r\n                            24:00\r\n                            He always describes this as KHULIQA (خُلِقَ), not KHALAQNA (خَلَقْنَا). This shows us with our free will, we change our creation.\r\n                            24:11\r\n                            The messenger: Where is Martha? Is Martha here? What is the linguistic term for something that \"was created\", instead of \"I created?\"\r\n                            24:24\r\n                            Oh, OK. So, Passive is right. I wasn't sure.\r\n                            24:38\r\n                            The messenger: No, but the human being can make himself worried, as you will see in the next verses.\r\n                            24:44\r\n                            In other words, the INSAN, the human being is made that something. It's made by the human, not by God.\r\n                            We create our own misery.\r\n                            25:00\r\n                            The messenger: Yeah, right. Edip: We can see in Quran, (23:14) فَتَبَارَكَ ٱللَّهُ أَحْسَنُ ٱلْخَـٰلِقِينَ\r\n                            25:05\r\n                            Allah is the best of the creators. The best Creator of creators.\r\n                            25:12\r\n                            أَحْسَنُ ٱلْخَـٰلِقِينَ There are many creators.\r\n                            25:17\r\n                            The messenger: In fact, in other words, we can create our own misery, or our own happiness.\r\n                            25:24\r\n                            But God instructs, they follow God's laws, they carry out God's laws.\r\n                            25:31\r\n                            Edip: لَّقَد خَلَقُوا۟ - Also, they create The messenger: This is just to bypass this linguistic tricks.\r\n                            25:51\r\n                            The messenger: Dark gray car with the lights on. Small dark gray...\r\n                            26:11\r\n                            The messenger: You'll get the makeup required next time, not now.\r\n                            26:23\r\n                            The messenger: Emily will find out.\r\n                            26:31\r\n                            The messenger: Ok. Go on, Edip. Edip: Yes. Verse 20. [70:20] If touched by adversity, despondent. [70:21] If blessed by wealth, stingy.\r\n                            26:43\r\n                            The messenger: What kind of car is it? Edip: [70:22] Except for the worshipers. [70:23] Who always observe their contact prayers (Salat).\r\n                            26:58\r\n                            [70:24] Part of their money is set aside.

[70:27] They reverence their Lord's requital.\r\n                            27:12\r\n                            [70:28] Their Lord's requital is not taken for granted.

Says for the believers.\r\n                            28:43\r\n                            Edip: [70:24] Part of their money is set aside.

This show us that charity, the amount of Zakat, is known by people.\r\n                            29:07\r\n                            The messenger: Specified. Edip: Specified.

The messenger: No, it is not. Edip: It is not?\r\n                            30:31\r\n                            Edip: In chapter 4, verse 25, Allah gives us permission to marry with captives of the war. The messenger: No, He is not.\r\n                            30:40\r\n                            Edip: Please open chapter 4, verse 25. The messenger: Look in the new translation.\r\n                            30:48\r\n                            The messenger: Edip inherited some of the old stuff, where they have wars with captives.\r\n                            30:55\r\n                            The messenger: What is legally theirs covers all the methods of marriage in the world.\r\n                            31:02\r\n                            There are places where there is no marriage. But a man and a woman will live together forever and have their children, and the society will know that these belong to each other.\r\n                            31:10\r\n                            You don't have anything lik. that anywhere. So, the Quran covers all the situations.\r\n                            31:17\r\n                            There are common law marriages in this country, and the Quran recognizes that.\r\n                            31:23\r\n                            It's what \"legally theirs\" means.\r\n                            31:39\r\n                            And, is there any question about this?\r\n                            31:44\r\n                            The messenger: I have a few comments.

Edip: Yes, slaves, you can marry with them. The messenger: Right, but not war captives.\r\n                            Worshippers who do not observe Salat are always worried – Being worried, despondent and stingy you do not belong with the believers. Salat remedies all these things. Traits of the believers.\r\n                            32:02\r\n                            Edip: Ah, Ok. The messenger: Ok, this is very important to note that the people who do not...the worshippers who do not observe the Contact Prayers are anxious.\r\n                            32:19\r\n                            Anxious, I really want a stronger word than anxious. In Arabic, هَلُوعًا is worried, always worried.\r\n                            32:27\r\n                            Nervous and anxious and worried, always worried. A human...huh? Yeah. Jittery and worried.\r\n                            32:35\r\n                            Worried, depressed, and anxiety and worry.\r\n                            32:42\r\n                            [70:20] If touched by adversity, despondent. [70:21] If blessed by wealth, stingy.\r\n                            32:47\r\n                            OK. Now. You can ask yourself this question. Do you worry?\r\n                            32:54\r\n                            Number 2, do you become despondent when something bad happens to you?\r\n                            33:00\r\n                            Number 3, are you stingy when you have money? If you have these three traits, then you do not belong with the worshippers, the believers.\r\n                            33:13\r\n                            I remember my father's teacher had a debate with some of the mullahs.\r\n                            33:19\r\n                            And he trapped him into this. He said \"do you worry a lot?\"\r\n                            33:24\r\n                            He said \"yeah, we're humans. We worry.\" He said \"if something bad happens to you, do you become upset?\"\r\n                            33:30\r\n                            He said \"yeah, we're human beings, we do that.\" And then he said So, he said \"well, then you don't belong with the worshippers who observe the Salat prayer.\"\r\n                            33:40\r\n                            Because in verse 22, it says (70:22) إِلَّا ٱلْمُصَلِّينَ\r\n                            33:45\r\n                            except those who observe the Salat prayers. So, the lesson is that if you do observe your Contact Prayers, this will cool you down. You will not worry. You will have nothing to worry about.\r\n                            33:55\r\n                            No fear, no worry. And you will not be despondent when adversity happens.\r\n                            34:04\r\n                            You will remember what the Quran says that you may dislike something which is good for you. You may not get the job that you want, but God knows it is not good for you, and you accept that.\r\n                            34:15\r\n                            So, you will not be despondent. You will not be miserable because you didn't make it in the job interview.\r\n                            34:22\r\n                            So then, we have a bunch of traits of the believers.\r\n                            34:27\r\n                            They always observe their Contact Prayers, verse 23. 24, a specific portion, 2.5% of their net income is set aside for the poor and the needy, 25.\r\n                            34:40\r\n                            26, they believe in the Day of Judgment. These are all traits of the believers.\r\n                            34:45\r\n                            27, [70:27] They reverence their Lord's requital. They worry about it. In other words, they don't want it. They know how bad it is, just making God angry.\r\n                            34:58\r\n                            God doesn't get angry, by the way, but I mean, violating His commandments.\r\n                            35:04\r\n                            27 28 [70:28] Their Lord's requital is not taken for granted.\r\n                            35:11\r\n                            In other words, when you look at this, you'll be severe against yourself. You will not be lax.\r\n                            35:21\r\n                            You will judge yourself according to these criteria and make sure that you're a believer.\r\n                            35:30\r\n                            You will be strict with yourself.\r\n                            35:36\r\n                            Number 29, [70:29] They keep their chastity. So, I mean, you look at this verse 29 and you keep your chastity.\r\n                            35:44\r\n                            You'll not be lax or careless.\r\n                            35:52\r\n                            Keeping the chastity is something that is unusual in this country. Because the society evolved so much in the last few decades.\r\n                            Chasity.\r\n                            36:05\r\n                            Maybe, I should get you the piece of paper that Phil handed me. Just one second.\r\n                            36:11\r\n                            It's appropriate to this.\r\n                            36:22\r\n                            It's for all those born before 1945, which probably includes you only.\r\n                            36:33\r\n                            Okay, but here it says \"we were certainly not before the difference between the sexes was discovered. But we were surely before the sex changed. We may do with what we had.\"\r\n                            36:48\r\n                            \"And we were the last generation that was so dumb as to think you needed a husband to have a baby.\"\r\n                            36:55\r\n                            \"No wonder we are so confused and there is such a generation gap.\" \"But we survived.\" OK.\r\n                            37:07\r\n                            I think there are some other points here that along the line that \"we were the last generation\r\n                            37:12\r\n                            that was so dumb as to think you needed a husband to have a baby.\" So, in other words, what happened in the last few decades is really very harmful to the people.\r\n                            37:26\r\n                            And we see what happened with AIDS, the spread of venereal diseases,\r\n                            37:36\r\n                            yes, lesbian mothers. Things that those born before 1945 never heard of these things.\r\n                            37:43\r\n                            But verse 29, the believers do not take it lightly, 29.\r\n                            37:50\r\n                            I'm writing an appendix on chastity and virginity for our children.\r\n                            37:58\r\n                            Our children better be different from the other children. It is your responsibility to teach your children for their own good that they must be virgin on their wedding night.\r\n                            38:11\r\n                            And I'm talking about boys and girls. And I'm going to show in the appendix how the happiness of your children depends on that.\r\n                            38:21\r\n                            The price is just too high if they don't follow this verse, this very short verse, 29.\r\n                            38:31\r\n                            [70:29] They keep their chastity. The price is really too high.\r\n                            38:36\r\n                            Now, even from the physiological and the physical point of view, the boys and the girls, when they mature first and they are ready for... they are not ready.\r\n                            38:49\r\n                            I mean, physiologically, they may have their menstruation, or they may... the voice may change, the boy's voice may change.\r\n                            38:58\r\n                            But physiologically and anatomically, they are not really ready for sex.\r\n                            39:03\r\n                            But in this country, they delve into sex without being ready, and they hurt themselves.\r\n                            39:09\r\n                            And they pay the price when they grow up. This is from the purely physical and physiological point of view.\r\n                            39:16\r\n                            But from the practical point of view, God sees to it that those who violate this...\r\n                            39:23\r\n                            Our boys and girls must be taught not to violate this. That they must keep their chastity, because when they do that, they pay from their happiness.\r\n                            39:35\r\n                            They will not have a happy marriage. They will not have a happy life. And, mind you, it is not easy. You must teach them that it is not easy to keep your chastity, especially in a society like this.\r\n                            39:48\r\n                            Joe Sobran is a reporter with the Los Angeles Times, and he had a wonderful commentary only yesterday, or the day before.\r\n                            39:57\r\n                            He says \"these boys, they go out and they have sex as if there are no consequences.\r\n                            40:03\r\n                            But the consequences are abortions, dangerous things that happen to... And the children who have...\r\n                            40:09\r\n                            These boys have no intention of raising them or supporting them. They create a lot of misery.\"\r\n                            40:16\r\n                            That was Joe Sobran's commentary, and he is not a Muslim. But here we are reading the Quran, and God knows what is good for us.\r\n                            40:22\r\n                            He is telling us that the believers must keep their chastity.\r\n                            40:33\r\n                            You know, all of you are young, and you have children who are growing, and I want to repeat\r\n                            40:40\r\n                            and emphasize and re-emphasize that it is your responsibility. If you just do your part, God will do the other part.\r\n                            40:48\r\n                            You cannot just leave them to the world out there. You have to do your part by teaching them what the Quran is saying, what God is saying.\r\n                            40:56\r\n                            Because if you really love them, you want them to be happy when they grow up. And one source of misery will be to break these laws.\r\n                            41:06\r\n                            They are not physiologically ready. They'll be breaking God's law, and the price is too high.\r\n                            41:16\r\n                            And if you... I know you do want them to be happy. So, I'm going to write this appendix in detail, and you can use it.\r\n                            41:26\r\n                            OK. Use me to give them these instructions. It is very difficult to be a father or a mother, and you talk to children about sex.\r\n                            41:37\r\n                            It's kind of awkward. But if you use the Quran, tell them \"this is what God says. Here is the appendix, read it.\"\r\n                            41:44\r\n                            And God will help you and will protect them.\r\n                            41:50\r\n                            So, and emphasize to them that it is not easy. You must exert, tell them they'll have to exert a lot of control.\r\n                            41:57\r\n                            Because the temptation is so great out there. And you are helping them this way when you tell them \"it is not easy.\" But you must exert for your own happiness and your own good.\r\n                            42:07\r\n                            You must exert a lot of control. You must resist. You know, they have a big thing saying, \"say no to drugs.\" But you never say \"say no to sex.\"\r\n                            42:16\r\n                            Even though it is disastrous.\r\n                            42:25\r\n                            Subhan Allah. OK.\r\n                            42:33\r\n                            Yes, this is a shock.\r\n                            42:44\r\n                            Yes. The messenger: Because this, I think it was Valentine's Day at the university, and they distributed free condoms.\r\n                            42:51\r\n                            It's like telling them \"go have sex,\" you know. They don't realize what they're doing and how much unhappiness they're causing to these kids.\r\n                            43:00\r\n                            But this is good news. Now, God is forcing. God says in Sura 41, verse 53, that God will show them His signs in the horizons and within themselves until they realize that this is the truth. This is good for us.\r\n                            43:15\r\n                            There is a big campaign in the country against alcohol. They don't do it because God said so. But they are forced by the disasters, the social disasters, and the broken families,\r\n                            43:28\r\n                            and the depression that is caused by alcohol, the hangovers and headaches, diseases.\r\n                            43:33\r\n                            Now, the book, there's a book in the market, a new book, that is called \"You Are What You Drink.\" I mentioned it before.\r\n                            43:40\r\n                            And it lists unbelievable disastrous health problems from alcohol.\r\n                            43:46\r\n                            Because it dissolves your brain. I mean, I'm talking about cancer, blood pressure, heart disease, established, scientifically established.\r\n                            43:55\r\n                            The messenger: Hmm? A woman: Liver disease. The messenger: Liver disease, of course, yes, it was known a long time ago. And the same is happening with violating this verse 29.\r\n                            44:04\r\n                            [70:29] They keep their chastity. The same thing is happening. There are unheard of diseases coming out.\r\n                            44:13\r\n                            AIDS is one of them. Uncurable.\r\n                            44:18\r\n                            skin cancer (unintelligible) You're telling me that now the... Naomi, you're thinking that now the females have a disease that is similar to AIDS. I heard about it a couple of weeks ago. You're gonna tell us more?\r\n                            44:28\r\n                            Naomi: There's a cancer that, you know, how many (unintelligible).\r\n                            44:35\r\n                            The messenger: Young girls who are sexually active, because they are not physiologically... they are not physiologically ready.\r\n                            44:43\r\n                            It takes maybe 10 years after the voice in the boy changes and the menstruation of the girl, maybe 10 years to really be ready to be pregnant and to be in a marriage relationship.\r\n                            44:56\r\n                            So God knows. God created us and knows what is good for us.\r\n                            Believers children are in God’s hand.\r\n                            45:03\r\n                            So, if you think I spend too much time on this, it's deliberate. Because you have a lot of responsibility. There are lots of beautiful, wonderful kids running around here. And they must be protected.\r\n                            45:13\r\n                            Like I said \"don't worry. You just do your part.\" You must know that your children are in God's hand.\r\n                            45:21\r\n                            You can't be with them every time. But God chaperones your children. You are a person.\r\n                            45:27\r\n                            You are a person of God. And you must have that confidence. You must know that God is with your children wherever they go.\r\n                            45:35\r\n                            If they are riding a bicycle in the middle of the street, or they are out with other people subjected to all the temptations of this society.\r\n                            45:43\r\n                            Don't worry. Drugs or sex or accidents, your children are in God's hand and you must have that confidence.\r\n                            45:52\r\n                            And being the oldest of you, I raised two kids, I know that. I know, I'm speaking from experience.\r\n                            45:58\r\n                            They've seen how much God's protection is marvelous. And they have seen how you just do your part and God will do His part in the most magnificent ways.\r\n                            46:11\r\n                            So, I didn't have relations with anybody else. In fact, this is repeated in verse 30. It says, [70:30] (They have relations) only with their spouses, or what is legally theirs—\r\n                            46:23\r\n                            So, there is a lot at stake. It is just not worth it, violating these laws.\r\n                            46:30\r\n                            These are very very harsh. The punishment is very harsh. It seems out of proportion.\r\n                            46:39\r\n                            So, do you want to test it? Go ahead. You're gonna pay through the nose. If you want to abide by God's law, then you attain a lot of happiness and you avoid lots of problems.\r\n                            46:50\r\n                            Okay, any questions?\r\n                            46:58\r\n                            Yes.\r\n                            Charity and showing off.\r\n                            47:13\r\n                            Right, they're being selfish. Like the fellow who donated a million dollars to the cancer center, but it had to be announced over the microphone in the stadium.\r\n                            47:22\r\n                            This is showing off and he's doing it for selfish reasons, maybe, maybe.\r\n                            47:28\r\n                            I mean, he has to be a believer in God to give things secretly. But the criterion is whether the person is cutting a portion of his money and giving it to the poor or not.\r\n                            47:39\r\n                            The minimum is 2.5%. If the person is giving away at least 2.5% of his or her money to the poor, then they're alright.\r\n                            47:49\r\n                            Farhad.\r\n                            We must observe “Umrah and Hajj”.\r\n                            48:08\r\n                            Yes. This is verse 30.\r\n                            48:14\r\n                            Yeah.\r\n                            48:20\r\n                            Yes. Or is very important. Yes. Yes.\r\n                            48:25\r\n                            This is... the Quran is so accurate that you have to pay attention to what Farhad is just saying. OR or AND.\r\n                            48:31\r\n                            There is a verse that says \"you shall observe Hajj and Umrah. And I have translated it, maybe even in the old translation, OR Umrah.\r\n                            48:40\r\n                            But we're supposed to observe... in pilgrimage, there are two things that must be observed, Hajj and Umrah. They must be done.\r\n                            48:46\r\n                            So, this is a similar... the difference is just a dash.\r\n                            48:52\r\n                            WA (وَ) or AW (أَو). That's the difference. You really have to pay attention to these things. Edip: Yes. Here, if you have spouses, you don't have negligence.\r\n                            49:01\r\n                            The messenger: Right. The messenger: See, because you either got married or you either got together without the benefit of marriage.\r\n                            49:10\r\n                            I don't wanna tell you that joke again. The guy in Africa, he wanted to know the secret of happy marriage. And somebody said \"what is marriage?\"\r\n                            49:18\r\n                            So, there are places in the world where there is no marriage. Edip: What is \"legally theirs\"?\r\n                            49:25\r\n                            The messenger: Yeah, \"legally\" means, there may be societies where, when the people reach the age of 21,\r\n                            49:34\r\n                            they are actually engaged at the time of birth in some of those societies.\r\n                            49:40\r\n                            They had a boy in the family and said \"this will be for my daughter.\" The tribe chief or something.\r\n                            49:45\r\n                            Because the daughter is not born yet, maybe. But these are political connections.\r\n                            49:52\r\n                            So, when they reach 21, they ship the boy and the girl into their new house and they become husband and wife forever.\r\n                            49:58\r\n                            She is legally his and he is legally hers. But there was no marriage ceremony and no such thing as marriage.\r\n                            Common law marriage and problems in marriage. Forced marriage against Quran.\r\n                            50:06\r\n                            So, the Quran must cover all situations. They legally belong to each other. In this country, common law marriages are legal as far as God is concerned. There are two people who decided to live together forever and raise a family.\r\n                            50:23\r\n                            The intention is for being together forever. They don't go through the state and the papers and the priest or Justice of the Peace or anything.\r\n                            50:31\r\n                            But they live together forever and that's legal as far as God is concerned.\r\n                            50:38\r\n                            A man: Many (unintelligible). The average has the most serious relation problems. (unintelligible). Technically, they are children of him. So, there are illicit, like, a lot of illicit sexual activities.\r\n                            50:58\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible). They don't have this sense of genuine love. (unintelligible).\r\n                            51:08\r\n                            A man: They can't see their parents loving each other. These are the ones that in fact are the most serious.\r\n                            51:17\r\n                            A man: I haven't... God knows, I haven't come in contact with a single case. Can't they see these relation problems or this type of thing that has not included some kind of adultery or disregard for marriage.\r\n                            51:37\r\n                            The messenger: By the way, I must clarify that when I talk about problems in marriage, there are all those problems in marriage.\r\n                            51:43\r\n                            But for people who keep their chastity until their marriage, they will have the regular problems of\r\n                            51:52\r\n                            bickering over the budget and what to be spent where and which house to pick out and\r\n                            51:58\r\n                            which room should be the living room and which room should be... These are normal problems. I'm talking about serious problems that are the price of the improper marriage.\r\n                            52:15\r\n                            A woman: So, you just mentioned that the parents (unintelligible) children. (unintelligible).\r\n                            52:42\r\n                            The messenger: No, this is inheritance of the things that the wife possessed.\r\n                            52:47\r\n                            It's not inheriting the person. I think I clarified this in the new translation.\r\n                            52:55\r\n                            \"You shall not inherit your wives forcibly\" means you cannot force her to write a will giving you everything, giving the husband everything. This is what it means.\r\n                            53:04\r\n                            But arranged marriages are done all over the world and a lot of them are very successful.\r\n                            53:22\r\n                            Well, this is prohibited in the Quran. Marriage against anybody's will is prohibited in the Quran anyway.\r\n                            53:27\r\n                            So... If a man inherits the wife in the sense that you are saying and she is happy and he is happy and they get married, fine.\r\n                            53:36\r\n                            Widows can get married. There is no problem.\r\n                            53:44\r\n                            There is a Jewish tradition about the brother marrying his brother's widow. This is an old tradition in Judaism.\r\n                            53:52\r\n                            There is nothing wrong with it if everybody is happy.\r\n                            54:01\r\n                            Yeah, well, No, this is against the Quran. Pardon?\r\n                            54:07\r\n                            Speak slowly. Yes, a few societies...\r\n                            54:19\r\n                            Actually, in this society, you find everything here in this society.\r\n                            54:27\r\n                            Any other question? Pari? Parivash: (unintelligible) marriages (unintelligible) legally. They live together. When they wanna leave, they say \"(unintelligible).\" Then, because they don't wanna be legally (unintelligible).\r\n                            54:47\r\n                            The messenger: It's only okay if they decide that they are together forever and that they will raise a family, the children and everything as a couple forever. The intention must be forever.\r\n                            54:58\r\n                            They may break up next month or next year, but if the intention was they're getting together forever, then it is okay.\r\n                            55:07\r\n                            It is not okay to get together with the intention that if things don't work out, goodbye.\r\n                            55:14\r\n                            Parivash: Because most of them, they don't wanna have that responsibility. The messenger: Right. Parivash: If they wanna live and maybe they can have a baby, but maybe it was...\r\n                            55:26\r\n                            Parivash: I think they don't want that they have that responsibility, but maybe they live for 15 or more than that.\r\n                            55:36\r\n                            The messenger: Like I said, if the intention was that they live together forever, then it is perfectly alright.\r\n                            55:41\r\n                            A woman: Some get married and they don't want the responsibility. Edip: It was his intention.\r\n                            55:50\r\n                            The messenger: Some people get married and one or both have the intention of not being together forever. That's prostitution.\r\n                            56:04\r\n                            The messenger: Back to Edip and verse number? What? Edip: 32. 33. Verse 33.\r\n                            56:11\r\n                            [70:33] Their testimony is truthful.\r\n                            56:17\r\n                            Edip: The verse contains another meaning, also. They stand firm in their testimony and their testimony is truthful.\r\n                            56:32\r\n                            They stand firm in their testimony even if it causes loss or trouble for them.\r\n                            56:41\r\n                            And the most important testimony is testimony for one's own God and also there are many other testimonies in this world.\r\n                            56:55\r\n                            And they stand firm and they are truthful in their testimonies. Verse 34,\r\n                            57:01\r\n                            [70:34] They consistently observe their contact prayers (Salat), on time.\r\n                            57:07\r\n                            Meanwhile, I want to tell you an interesting event in my life about this verse.\r\n                            57:16\r\n                            The verse chapter 29:45. It is over here. Chapter 29:45.\r\n                            57:34\r\n                            [29:45] You shall recite what is revealed to you of the scripture, and observe the Contact Prayers (Salat), for the Contact Prayers prohibit evil and vice. But the remembrance of GOD (through Salat) is the most important objective.* GOD knows everything you do.\r\n                            57:56\r\n                            This summer, I was preparing a book about the mistakes in Turkish translations.\r\n                            58:05\r\n                            I was dealing about 40 verses, important verses.\r\n                            58:12\r\n                            I gave the original to the... for the copy, to be copied on film.\r\n                            58:23\r\n                            The person gave me back. I found that he missed two verses.\r\n                            58:33\r\n                            He forgot to copy two verses and only one verse is by mistake he had taken it copied. The verse was this verse, verse 29:45.\r\n                            58:46\r\n                            And I told him that you must take these two verses that you have forgotten and not this.\r\n                            58:55\r\n                            This is wrong because I wanted verse thirty-nine chapter forty-five.\r\n                            59:02\r\n                            He supposed that I wanted chapter twenty-nine. He mixed thirty-nine with twenty-nine.\r\n                            59:11\r\n                            I corrected it. Later, I received the three films but I found that also he had mistake on this verse.\r\n                            59:23\r\n                            Instead of 39:45, he made the same mistake on 29:45.\r\n                            59:31\r\n                            It was very interesting because that time, a few time, I delayed my Salat\r\n                            59:37\r\n                            and I was not good that time about my prayer and Allah reminded me about Salat because God is fully aware of everything you do.\r\n                            59:52\r\n                            You must observe your Salat.\r\n                            1:00:00\r\n                            Let's go on. 35. He couldn't understand.\r\n                            1:00:08\r\n                            A man: Verse 23 and 34 add up to 57. God says [70:34] They consistently observe their contact prayers (Salat), on time.\r\n                            1:00:19\r\n                            That consistent means (unintelligible). Another thing here is that we can see that Salat protects.\r\n                            1:00:28\r\n                            As God says he keeps the believers away from violating these laws of God.\r\n                            1:00:36\r\n                            Edip: Verse 24? Chapter 24? A man: No, no. A man: In the Sura we are reading, verse 23 and 34 add up to 57.\r\n                            1:00:50\r\n                            Salat helps and protects the believers to be on the right path.\r\n                            1:01:01\r\n                            Verse 35 [70:35] They have deserved a position of honor, in Paradise.\r\n                            1:01:07\r\n                            [70:36] What is keeping those who disbelieved from joining you? [70:37] To the right, and to the left, they flee.\r\n                            1:01:14\r\n                            [70:38] How can any of them expect to enter the blissful Paradise? [70:39] Never; we created them, and they know from what.\r\n                            1:01:32\r\n                            Verse 40, [70:40] I solemnly swear by the Lord of the easts and the wests; we are able—\r\n                            1:01:41\r\n                            Rashad, I want to ask you a question about the Quran in the parenthesis.\r\n                            1:01:47\r\n                            (Unintelligible)\r\n                            1:02:00\r\n                            [70:40] I solemnly swear by the Lord of the easts and the wests; we are able— [70:41] to substitute better people in your place; we can never be defeated.\r\n                            1:02:14\r\n                            The messenger: God, God speaks. Edip: God swears by Himself.\r\n                            1:02:23\r\n                            Lord of the Easts and the Wests position of stars and position of moon and sun also their rotation.\r\n                            1:02:36\r\n                            Allah governs all the universe and Allah says\r\n                            1:02:45\r\n                            (56:75) فَلَآ أُقْسِمُ بِمَوَٰقِعِ ٱلنُّجُومِ [56:75] I swear by the positions of the stars. The messenger: position.\r\n                            1:02:57\r\n                            Here, swearing is personal. \"I\"... with \"I\" But, the second verse we see \"we.\"\r\n                            1:03:06\r\n                            [70:41] to substitute better people in your place; we can never be defeated.\r\n                            1:03:12\r\n                            And we here can understand that Allah has many soldiers from angels and believers.\r\n                            1:03:23\r\n                            And they cannot be defeated.\r\n                            1:03:28\r\n                            [70:42] Therefore, let them blunder and play, until they meet the day that is awaiting them.\r\n                            1:03:34\r\n                            [70:43] That is the day they come out of the graves in a hurry, as if herded to the (sacrificial) altars.\r\n                            1:03:44\r\n                            [70:44] With their eyes subdued, shame will cover them. That is the day that is awaiting them.\r\n                            1:03:56\r\n                            The messenger: Thank you very much. Good job. Are there any questions on the whole Sura or anything?\r\n                            1:04:04\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: Yes, I just want to go back to what Eric asked you. He asked if there is... just wanna first make sure it's actually in the Quran and according to the the teaching of the Quran.\r\n                            1:04:20\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: Does Quran require a Muslim to get married? Some specified rules (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:04:32\r\n                            The messenger: Yes, the Quran consistently talks about marriage and making it official and everything.\r\n                            1:04:38\r\n                            Yes, but I'm talking about generally in this country, people who never saw the Quran, never came across the Quran.\r\n                            1:04:45\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: You are a Muslim and you are obligated to go through marriage according to the rules that...\r\n                            1:04:52\r\n                            The messenger: Marriage is a very organized institution according to the Quran. Because God tells exactly who we can marry and who we cannot marry. And it's an elaborate and divine institution that is very organized.\r\n                            Believers are Hard honest workers. They are not lazy. Rich Vs. Poor believers.\r\n                            1:05:07\r\n                            I'm glad you pointed this out. Dr. Sabahi: Yes, I got the wrong impression.\r\n                            1:05:13\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: The other thing was when you keep talking about God provides you, God loves you, God knows what you're gonna do and things like that.\r\n                            1:05:25\r\n                            Especially the younger ones, they may not think that \"okay, if God wants me to get this job, I'm gonna get it. So, I will sit down here. I'm not gonna work, I'm not gonna try.\"\r\n                            1:05:39\r\n                            The messenger: That will be against the Quran. The messenger: We're going against the Quran. The true believer is the hardest working person and the best producer in his job or her job, wherever they go.\r\n                            1:05:53\r\n                            And they enjoy every minute of it. Believers are very hard workers and the most honest workers.\r\n                            1:06:02\r\n                            And they are the best producers and they enjoy every second of it.\r\n                            1:06:08\r\n                            They are not lazy. God doesn't want the lazies. He wants people on the ball in His Kingdom.\r\n                            1:06:22\r\n                            Our teacher next Friday is Apamea. And she's gonna take the next 19 Suras, from Sura 70 to Sura 89.\r\n                            1:06:33\r\n                            From Sura 71 to Sura 89.\r\n                            1:06:40\r\n                            Yes, Robert? Robert: What's the motivational factor? You talked about this before. The motivational factor is wanting to better yourself, do better financially. The messenger: Very good.\r\n                            1:06:53\r\n                            The messenger: Sura 16 says \"the rich believer is better than the poor believer.\"\r\n                            1:06:58\r\n                            And Edip wanted me to change this for possible misunderstandings. But I did not, because God meant that.\r\n                            1:07:06\r\n                            Remember it says \"the rich believer and the poor believer, both are believers.\" Both are equally believing.\r\n                            1:07:12\r\n                            But one of them is able to do things, is able to give to charity, is able to\r\n                            1:07:18\r\n                            further the cause of God and spread the word of God and do things that will make a difference.\r\n                            1:07:26\r\n                            So, this is a motivation. Robert: But isn't it also a natural thing in every case to want to better your own services, to want to say...\r\n                            1:07:37\r\n                            The messenger: Without being frustrated, yes. Yes. Yes.\r\n                            1:07:42\r\n                            Absolutely. Because of that principle in Sura 16.\r\n                            1:07:48\r\n                            You wanna.... you want to do things. You want to buy a million dollar ad in the Wall Street Journal to say to the people \"worship God alone.\"\r\n                            1:07:57\r\n                            And you cannot do that unless you better your own circumstances.\r\n                            1:08:04\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: I have one question. You alluded to something, that some people have changed the type of verses in the Quran.\r\n                            1:08:18\r\n                            What is the reason? How do we know that these are the verses in the way of preparation of the Quran?\r\n                            1:08:23\r\n                            (Unintelligible) ...that these number of verses in the Quran, the verses that are part of one Sura, and then another part of another Sura.\r\n                            1:08:34\r\n                            How do we know that these are the verses in the Quran? The messenger: Just buy a copy of the new translation.\r\n                            1:08:45\r\n                            The messenger: That's it. A woman: The number 19 The messenger: Yeah. It's gonna be mathematically solved. Edip: Mathematically, rather, it shows us that it's correct. Dr. Sabahi: No, before the mathematics.\r\n                            1:08:58\r\n                            The messenger: Yes, there are authorized printings. And they are the closest to the truth.\r\n                            1:09:05\r\n                            They have... we know the mistakes in them. There are three mistakes in them. In the authorized versions of the Quran printed in Saudi Arabia or Egypt.\r\n                            1:09:14\r\n                            Avoid the ones printed in Iran. They misspelled them and messed them up.\r\n                            1:09:21\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: Can it be verses, the numbering of the verses? The messenger: That's possible. But I know that they \"simplified\" the Quranic Arabic, and they wrote it in the modern. Edip: In Turkey, also.\r\n                            1:09:35\r\n                            The messenger: Also in Turkey? Edip: Yes. Misspelling. The messenger: So, the first Quran ever in history that is the way God wanted it to be printed, from here, come out of here in the next few weeks, IN SHAA ALLAH.\r\n                            1:09:52\r\n                            The messenger: Farhad? Farhad: You mentioned the Persian translation is developing. Another translation is the introduction in the Persian language.\r\n                            1:10:06\r\n                            Farhad: Another translation is in Arabic translating into Persian. The meaning of this is hugely important. The messenger: Yes. Farhad: Another translation...\r\n                            1:10:21\r\n                            The messenger: Well, I have good news for you. There is a Farsi translation being done now from my translation.\r\n                            1:10:26\r\n                            So, you should have it in a year or so, IN SHAA ALLAH.\r\n                            1:10:31\r\n                            We have authorized the Farsi translation. The messenger: No. The messenger: Susan Ray? No.\r\n                            1:10:40\r\n                            It's done by Behruz. Did you meet Behruz? Behruz Mofidi Shirazi.\r\n                            1:10:47\r\n                            He's doing this, just going very fast. Martha, did you say something?\r\n                            1:11:07\r\n                            The messenger: You are not reading your Muslim perspective, you are (unintelligible). You are not reading your Muslim perspective.\r\n                            1:11:16\r\n                            The messenger: Not maybe. You're not reading your Muslim perspective. It's right there. That's the answer to your question, yes.\r\n                            1:11:24\r\n                            Perfect answer to question in details. Go read it, now.\r\n                            1:11:30\r\n                            Any other questions, while Martha is reading the answer to her question?\r\n                            1:11:38\r\n                            Can you what? What did she say now?\r\n                            1:11:44\r\n                            A woman: I said \"any other questions that Rashad can avoid tonight (unintelligible).\r\n                            Compilation of the Quran. Explains release of Quran to Prophets Memory.\r\n                            1:12:00\r\n                            The messenger: Well, it takes a minute, but it answers your question perfectly. The answer is yes. The Prophet Muhammad was given specific instructions.\r\n                            1:12:08\r\n                            Every time Gabriel released Quran from Muhammad's soul to Muhammad's memory, he gave him instructions as to where these three or four verses belong.\r\n                            1:12:18\r\n                            And he wrote down those verses and he put instructions next to them.\r\n                            1:12:23\r\n                            So, when he died, he left the complete Quran, but not in the order that God wanted for the world.\r\n                            1:12:30\r\n                            He left the Quran with instructions on the side as to which Sura goes after what Sura and which verse goes after which verse.\r\n                            1:12:42\r\n                            The messenger: Exactly. They followed the instructions. They put the Quran together, but then Satan tricked them into adding two verses.\r\n                            1:12:48\r\n                            And that was during Uthman's time. And this triggered the war between Ali and his family and the Umayyads.\r\n                            1:12:56\r\n                            A woman: That's the thing that you're referring to in the... I read that part. The part about Ali and his family.\r\n                            1:13:04\r\n                            The messenger: Right. There were 50 years of bitter war, but unfortunately the Umayyads won.\r\n                            1:13:11\r\n                            So, we got their version. We didn't get the version of the believers.\r\n                            1:13:17\r\n                            A woman: Did Jesus have a (unintelligible)? The messenger: No. (Unintelligible).\r\n                            1:13:27\r\n                            The messenger: He was an angel.\r\n                            1:13:34\r\n                            The messenger: No, he didn't see him as an angel. A woman: Did he just dream it? The messenger: No, no, no, he didn't dream. Gabriel comes and takes and becomes part of Muhammad's body and releases the...\r\n                            1:13:45\r\n                            Gabriel did a connection between Muhammad's soul and Muhammad's physical body.\r\n                            1:13:52\r\n                            He didn't need to see him.\r\n                            1:13:57\r\n                            The messenger: No, not like that. When... in possession, you lose your... In the possession, you lose your identity completely.\r\n                            1:14:04\r\n                            If you... if we are possessed by an angel or a demon or whatever, Naomi disappears and the other entity takes over completely.\r\n                            1:14:11\r\n                            And you have no consciousness at all. But Muhammad was fully conscious.\r\n                            1:14:16\r\n                            He just had these words come to him and he would write down the verses. It comes to his memory.\r\n                            1:14:22\r\n                            Just like you're remembering something. You remember that you took a final exam three days ago and the questions were this, this, and this. And you can write them down.\r\n                            1:14:31\r\n                            So, this is how he received them. Oh, yeah.\r\n                            1:14:39\r\n                            Okay, well, whatever your dearest wish is, turn to God and ask him for it.\r\n                            1:14:44\r\n                            The best wish being to stay on the right path.

[71:12] \"'And provide you with money and children, and orchards, and streams.'\"\r\n                            2:19\r\n                            [71:13] Why should you not strive to reverence GOD? [71:14] He is the One who created you in stages.\r\n                            2:25\r\n                            [71:15] Do you not realize that GOD created seven universes in layers? [71:16] He designed the moon therein to be a light, and placed the sun to be a lamp.\r\n                            2:35\r\n                            [71:17] And GOD germinated you from the earth like plants. [71:18] Then He returns you into it, and He will surely bring you out.\r\n                            2:43\r\n                            [71:19] GOD made the earth habitable for you. [71:20] That you may build roads therein. [71:21] Noah said, \"My Lord, they disobeyed me, and followed those who were even more corrupted when blessed with money and children.\r\n                            2:56\r\n                            [71:22] \"They schemed terrible schemes. [71:23] \"They said, 'Do not abandon your gods. Do not abandon Wadd, Suwaa', Yaghouth, Ya'ooq, and Nasr.'\r\n                            3:05\r\n                            [71:24] \"They misled many. Therefore, let the wicked plunge deeper into loss.\"\r\n                            3:11\r\n                            [71:25] Because of their sins they were drowned and assigned to the hellfire. They found no helpers to protect them from GOD.\r\n                            3:18\r\n                            [71:26] Noah also said, \"My Lord, do not leave a single disbeliever on earth. [71:27] \"For if you let them, they will only mislead your servants and give birth to nothing but wicked disbelievers.\r\n                            3:29\r\n                            [71:28] \"My Lord, forgive me and my parents, and anyone who enters my home as a believer, and all the believing men and women. But do not give the disbelievers anything but annihilation.\"\r\n                            3:40\r\n                            The messenger: Mã Shã Allãh.\r\n                            3:53\r\n                            Apamea: I think that this Sura is very clear. It, basically, really reminds us what's truly important and what God has given us and what God has provided for us.\r\n                            4:07\r\n                            And a true example of the past, and an entire chapter dedicated to Noah\r\n                            4:12\r\n                            who lived 950 years, which we're told in one of the chapters.\r\n                            4:17\r\n                            And it's the longest that any of the messengers lived. And he was the messenger who came after Adam.\r\n                            4:26\r\n                            And he was with the people for a long period of time. And he was chosen by God to clearly give the message for a long time to the people.\r\n                            4:37\r\n                            And he implored the people so much and tried to teach them and preach to them what's really important.\r\n                            4:44\r\n                            And to basically open their eyes and tell them that this is what God has provided you.\r\n                            4:51\r\n                            And he gives them examples from what's around them, everything that they see.\r\n                            4:58\r\n                            For instance, what stares at them during the day, which is the sun. And God has created that, like, as a lamp.\r\n                            5:06\r\n                            And the moon at night, especially when it's full, like last night or whatever, and you cannot miss it, the beauty of it, the light of it.\r\n                            5:14\r\n                            It just brightens everything. I woke up in the middle of the night, last night. I just saw it and it was just through the curtain, it was just real bright.\r\n                            5:24\r\n                            So here, these creations are placed, you know, around us.\r\n                            5:30\r\n                            And how blind these people are not to notice it, not to realize it, not to even think about it.\r\n                            5:37\r\n                            Like Abraham did and he looked at the sun and the moon and thought \"oh, that was God.\" \"No.\" The sun went down and now the moon is up. \"That must be God.\"\r\n                            5:46\r\n                            \"No.\" You know, so on and so forth. He seeked and he found because he wanted to find God and God helped him.\r\n                            5:54\r\n                            Now, these people are so blind and deaf and they basically just refused any invitation\r\n                            6:00\r\n                            from Noah and any teachings that he was trying to give to them.\r\n                            6:06\r\n                            And he was telling them \"hey, God is Merciful. He will forgive your sins. All you need to do is repent and ask guidance from Him.\"\r\n                            6:16\r\n                            And people basically just closed their ears and just covered themselves and didn't want to hear it.\r\n                            6:22\r\n                            However much he insisted, publicly, privately, he did his best and he loudly told them and he quietly told them.\r\n                            6:32\r\n                            However, he mentioned the message, they wouldn't accept.\r\n                            6:38\r\n                            And this reminds me of a Khutba that we had by Dr. Khalifa and he was giving us the example\r\n                            6:45\r\n                            in regards to this same message that when you see someone going towards a cliff\r\n                            6:53\r\n                            and you know that the cliff is present there and the person is gonna fall off of it\r\n                            6:59\r\n                            and hurt themselves badly or die or whatever, but that person is not aware. First, you inform them when that person is with you like miles and miles away when you can't even see that cliff.\r\n                            7:09\r\n                            You tell them \"hey, listen, so many miles away there is a cliff there. Watch out for it.\" OK. Then, you just observe the person going that direction.\r\n                            7:17\r\n                            The closer they're getting, it's just because you care about that person. You don't want them to fall off. And then the closer they're getting, you shout louder and louder and then you just wanna run to them and hold them from falling off.\r\n                            7:30\r\n                            This is clearly what I remember from Khutba and this is what I get, this message from this surah that here is this man trying to shake these people.\r\n                            7:38\r\n                            First, he gives them the message and he basically tries to do his best, you know, to carry on the message\r\n                            7:45\r\n                            and relay it, but these people are just deaf and blind. And he tells them that God has created you in stages and this is the most beautiful part. Aya 17, it says\r\n                            8:02\r\n                            [71:17] And GOD germinated you from the earth like plants. And this is what I find about the Quran. It's a book of laws.\r\n                            8:11\r\n                            It's a book... it teaches us about so many things, about the past, the future, the present.\r\n                            8:16\r\n                            It also has poetry in it and this is what really touched me. Also, Aya 16 which is\r\n                            8:24\r\n                            [71:16] He designed the moon therein to be a light, and placed the sun to be a lamp. [71:17] And GOD germinated you from the earth like plants.\r\n                            8:31\r\n                            And this is so true because God created us from the pottery clay. And here is a plant that you see every day.\r\n                            8:38\r\n                            If you have a plant and take care of it and water it, you see how it germinates and how it just basically comes up. And new leaves that you see, it's bright, you know, green and then it turns dark green and it gets bigger.\r\n                            8:49\r\n                            And this is how we are. We were a baby. And we grow up and all these beautiful children that we have here. These are all signs from God.\r\n                            8:57\r\n                            And again, people are blind to see all these beautiful things. And God has created this earth and He has made it habitable for us.\r\n                            9:08\r\n                            And these roads and we see new highways coming, new freeways and wonderful roads that we have always building on and on and on and on.\r\n                            9:17\r\n                            And these are everything that we have been blessed with by God.\r\n                            9:23\r\n                            And He clearly says \"obey Me and follow Me.\" Obey God and follow this message and you will be taken care of.\r\n                            9:35\r\n                            You will have a wonderful life, you know. God will shower you generously with rain. What is rain? It's a sign of bounty.\r\n                            9:44\r\n                            Rain comes and, you know, all the plants grow and we have food.\r\n                            9:49\r\n                            And the money that's provided and the children that we'll have, IN SHAA ALLAH, and orchards and streams, all of these are beautiful.\r\n                            9:59\r\n                            We sit by a stream and we enjoy the beauty of it by the greenery or whatever, anywhere in the nature.\r\n                            10:06\r\n                            So, why shouldn't you, as Aya 13 says, [71:13] Why should you not strive to reverence GOD?\r\n                            10:12\r\n                            Why shouldn't you? These are all these wonderful things that God is promising you. And these are all the facts that I'm telling you about, the moon and the sun and, you know, how you germinate like plants\r\n                            10:23\r\n                            and how you are created in stages within the womb and outside as we grow into adulthood.\r\n                            10:30\r\n                            Why not do it? And again people wouldn't listen. So finally, he gets so frustrated and he just turns to God and says in Aya 21,\r\n                            10:40\r\n                            [71:21] ...\"My Lord, they disobeyed me, and followed those who were even more corrupted when blessed with money and children.\r\n                            10:45\r\n                            Here we go, money and children. We see many examples of this in this society, any society.\r\n                            10:54\r\n                            You think that's the only thing that's important. Then, you have children and they become the center of your life.\r\n                            11:01\r\n                            And you strive so hard for them. You don't have any rest at all sometimes because you're working night and day for your children and to money and the greed.\r\n                            11:11\r\n                            And you just basically may forget about God. God willing, we'll always stay on the path that we walk.\r\n                            11:18\r\n                            So, he says \"God, if these people go on without any retribution, they're gonna keep on being corrupted with money and children.\r\n                            11:28\r\n                            And they will have terrible schemes\" as it says in Aya 22. And they didn't wanna abandon their god. They didn't wanna let go of their own idols.\r\n                            11:37\r\n                            And God...And in the Sura...in Aya 23 it says, \"Do not abandon Wadd...\"\r\n                            11:44\r\n                            and I think, I don't know what those things are, but I think they're idols.... or something\r\n                            11:51\r\n                            The messenger: The names of their idols.\r\n                            12:00\r\n                            Apamea: And people were just trying to mislead each other and preach to each other and try to tell each other that \"hey, don't let go of these idols. These are the ones that are important to you.\"\r\n                            12:17\r\n                            And again, as it says in 24, [71:24] \"They misled many. Therefore, let the wicked plunge deeper into loss.\"\r\n                            12:23\r\n                            They'll just go deeper and deeper into what's worse for them, the worst things that could happen to them.\r\n                            12:29\r\n                            And they will always stay in their sin. So, what's waiting for them is the hellfire.\r\n                            12:38\r\n                            And there will be no helpers at all to protect them from God. Because God's wrath is great and God's promise is great.\r\n                            12:47\r\n                            His bounties are fantastic and He tells us \"hey, either go the way of righteousness\r\n                            12:54\r\n                            or you go the way of sinfulness and being a disbeliever and idol-worshiping.\"\r\n                            13:02\r\n                            And you will deserve hellfire. And so Noah turns to God and says, [71:26] ....\"My Lord, do not leave a single disbeliever on earth.\r\n                            13:11\r\n                            He really did his best to try to preach to these people and let them know about this good information.\r\n                            13:17\r\n                            And what will happen, if these people stay on, [71:27] \"....they will only mislead your servants and give birth to nothing but wicked disbelievers.\r\n                            13:26\r\n                            And we are told at the mosque here how the children are assigned to particular parents\r\n                            13:32\r\n                            and how parents are responsible to teach the good word, you know, what they know about God to their children and pass on the information.\r\n                            13:41\r\n                            And to let them, to always remind them of their prayers, that they have to do their prayers on time and read the Quran.\r\n                            13:49\r\n                            But in a family that there are with disbeliever parents, what do you expect from these parents?\r\n                            13:54\r\n                            They're not gonna sit there and talk about God in front of the children. Obviously the children are not going to be informed at all.\r\n                            14:00\r\n                            And so what's gonna happen, these idol worshippers, these disbelievers will mislead\r\n                            14:08\r\n                            the servants of God possibly and give birth to nothing but wicked disbelievers.\r\n                            14:14\r\n                            And the chain will just go on and on and on. And so he asks forgiveness for himself and his parents and other people who have come to\r\n                            14:25\r\n                            who have come to his home and try to accept, you know, they accepted the word.\r\n                            14:31\r\n                            And the believing men and women. And Noah says in Aya 28, [71:28] \"...But do not give the disbelievers anything but annihilation.\"\r\n                            14:41\r\n                            Basically just puts it straight. Annihilation will be awaiting them.\r\n                            14:47\r\n                            And as we know, the flood came. Even his wife and son were the disbelievers there among the crowd.\r\n                            14:57\r\n                            And as we learned in the other chapters that God told him \"make the ark and you'll have a pair of the animals.\r\n                            15:09\r\n                            And the believers all went with him and they were saved. And that was God's promise to all these believers.\r\n                            15:15\r\n                            And so he told his son \"come on with us.\" And his son thought that he could be safe on top of whatever it was, on top of someplace high.\r\n                            15:27\r\n                            And he thought that he could be safe from this flood. But the flood came and destroyed everything.\r\n                            15:35\r\n                            And Noah and the believers were all saved. So, I think that this Sura was very self-explanatory, very direct, poetic in some areas.\r\n                            15:47\r\n                            And basically put us in touch with our creation. And, you know, how hard this messenger was truly working to inform the people of the good message.\r\n                            16:02\r\n                            The messenger: Poopak?\r\n                            16:15\r\n                            The messenger: Any questions on Sura 71?\r\n                            16:20\r\n                            Okay, I have a couple of comments, as usual.\r\n                            16:56\r\n                            Are you concerned about these fellows? A woman: It reminds me of the....\r\n                            Noah’s disbelieving people and their example repeated today. Message one and the same.\r\n                            17:18\r\n                            A woman: It says \"those who enter my home as a believer.\" So, if they enter his home as a believer, we don't know what (unintelligible). The messenger: It means \"join.\" It means \"join.\"\r\n                            17:27\r\n                            The messenger: But he was 950, it's better to (unintelligible) 1,000.\r\n                            17:35\r\n                            They're pretty old. They're over 40.\r\n                            17:45\r\n                            Okay, well, I think every one of you is a Noah. You've all gone through this experience.\r\n                            17:50\r\n                            And what we learn from this Sura is that the human being is a human being is a human being.\r\n                            17:56\r\n                            From the very first day, from the time of Adam, the human beings have been the same.\r\n                            18:03\r\n                            Each one of you have gone through the same experiences that Noah went through.\r\n                            18:10\r\n                            You can be as young as Naomi, and you can go through a lot of the same things that Noah went through. Naomi is not 1,000 yet, or even 700 years.\r\n                            18:19\r\n                            But she went through it. She was telling me about this law school student and how she... He's only one of many that she talked to, I know that.\r\n                            18:28\r\n                            And the reaction... she talked about a message from God that's mathematically coded, superhuman, definitely from God,\r\n                            18:35\r\n                            tells us exactly how to be saved. And then he says \"oh, this is good for you, but for me, I would like to see this and that.\"\r\n                            18:43\r\n                            So, his response was the same response that Noah got.\r\n                            18:50\r\n                            And you notice in verse 7, he's saying, [71:7] \"Whenever I invited them to be forgiven by You,...\r\n                            18:56\r\n                            For heaven's sake, you're inviting the people to be forgiven. You're inviting them to be perfectly happy in this life and forever.\r\n                            19:04\r\n                            You're not asking them for money, but they are... oh, I got this here for you.\r\n                            19:11\r\n                            I cleaned this two days ago. This is the live picture outside the mosque.\r\n                            19:17\r\n                            And there are here now about 76 bugs.\r\n                            19:22\r\n                            Some of them are pretty big, you know. You don't know how they got in there. They worked so hard to go in there and burn in Hell.\r\n                            19:29\r\n                            This is what the people are doing. They work so hard to avoid Heaven and to go to Hell. They pay whatever price it takes to go to Hell.\r\n                            19:40\r\n                            And they work very hard for it. So, this is... God gave us this as an example.\r\n                            19:46\r\n                            It's very difficult. On your way out, just look at it and see how they got in there. They had to work very hard to burn and go to Hell.\r\n                            19:54\r\n                            And this is what the people are doing, since the time of Noah. Now, Noah was the most probably the first... well, he was the first prophet and probably the first messenger after Adam.\r\n                            20:07\r\n                            All the people on earth were living around what is the Dead Sea is now.\r\n                            20:13\r\n                            The Dead Sea is the remnant of the Noah's flood. So, this gives an idea how primitive, how early in history this was.\r\n                            20:22\r\n                            And the human being was exactly the same.\r\n                            20:29\r\n                            Another thing, the message, another lesson we learn is that the message has been almost one and the same.\r\n                            20:38\r\n                            You see it here in verse 3. Worship God alone.\r\n                            20:44\r\n                            Reverence Him, and obey, obey Him. So, this is the message that every single messenger said \"Worship God alone\", \"Worship God alone\", from day one to the end of the world.\r\n                            20:55\r\n                            This is the only message that God is sending to us in order to be redeemed. In order to make up for our crimes we committed billions of years ago.\r\n                            21:04\r\n                            So, this is the other lesson. But the message is one and the same from that time. And then there is a scientific miracle that Apamea didn't emphasize enough, or maybe didn't notice.\r\n                            21:19\r\n                            In 16, God says, [71:16] He designed the moon therein to be a light, and placed the sun to be a lamp.\r\n                            21:26\r\n                            There's a difference. A lamp is a source of light.\r\n                            21:32\r\n                            But if I have a mirror here, and the mirror reflects this light, the mirror will give light.\r\n                            21:37\r\n                            I can send light to that dark room over there, but the mirror will not be a source of light.\r\n                            21:42\r\n                            So, it's very clear in verse 16.\r\n                            21:49\r\n                            God is telling us, and this is consistent throughout the Quran, that the sun is a source and the moon is reflective.\r\n                            21:55\r\n                            The material of the moon is very special. This grayish material is very reflective. And this is what Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin said when they landed on the moon.\r\n                            22:07\r\n                            They held it in their hands, in their gloves, excuse me, and they said \"it's quite reflective.\"\r\n                            22:13\r\n                            It's a strange material, but God made it that way. God designed it so Apamea can see it through her curtain.\r\n                            22:20\r\n                            And it's amazing how much light comes and is reflected by the moon.\r\n                            MOC “I wish I could have translated it better”.\r\n                            22:31\r\n                            What else?\r\n                            22:37\r\n                            There's another significant matter in 25. We learn a very good lesson here. 25 says,\r\n                            22:44\r\n                            [71:25] Because of their sins they were drowned and assigned to the hellfire. They found no helpers to protect them from GOD.\r\n                            22:54\r\n                            Now, the Arabic, I wish I could have translated it better. I like this translation.\r\n                            23:03\r\n                            It's better than the first one, to me. But I wish it was better, because the verse implies that they knew, which is true.\r\n                            23:11\r\n                            People know at the time of death, if they're going to Heaven or Hell.\r\n                            23:17\r\n                            They know, and then after that it is either a nightmare, continuous nightmare, from which there is no awakening.\r\n                            23:24\r\n                            In fact, the awakening is worse, because they wake up to the real Hell. Or, it's a beautiful dream, depending on how they redeem themselves or not.\r\n                            23:35\r\n                            So, verse 25 teaches us that the people know at the time of death. And this is... throughout the Quran, we learn that.\r\n                            23:45\r\n                            The angels tell the person, the angel of death tells the person whether he or she is heading for Heaven or Hell at the time of death, so they know.\r\n                            23:55\r\n                            Are there any questions on this Sura? A man: Do we have any information on what language is throughout the new and old Testaments?\r\n                            Most probably Aramaic language used during time of Noah. Salat did not exist during Noah time.\r\n                            24:07\r\n                            The messenger: Most probably Aramaic. The messenger: Aramaic is the oldest scriptural language, and it is a different language even now.\r\n                            24:17\r\n                            I have a tape here that teaches Aramaic, and it's very close to the Arabic. It's the same alphabet, the same order as Arabic, and the words that we use here in this mosque, a lot of them are Aramaic.\r\n                            24:33\r\n                            For example, the name of God, Allah. That was the name in Aramaic. This is the name that all the prophets and messengers used. This is a very good question, so pay attention.\r\n                            24:44\r\n                            All the prophets used the same name for God, Allah. Noah, Job, Abraham, Moses, Jesus.\r\n                            24:53\r\n                            The tape I have specifically is about the language of Jesus, and I have a book that was with me, and God's name was Allah.\r\n                            25:02\r\n                            This is what all the prophets and messengers used for the name of God, from Adam until the end of the world.\r\n                            25:08\r\n                            The prayer was Salat. In Noah's language, in Adam's language, in Abraham's language, in Jesus' language, in our language, there are many things in common.\r\n                            25:20\r\n                            I have a book here, if you want to see it later, or hear the tape I just left you here.\r\n                            25:25\r\n                            So, most probably the language is Aramaic.\r\n                            25:36\r\n                            So, not the Sabbath. Not the Sabbath. In fact, this is another good question, because you do not see the order to observe Salat before Abraham.\r\n                            25:47\r\n                            You notice here, Noah did not say \"I want you to observe the Salat prayer and the Zakat charity, like Abraham.\r\n                            25:54\r\n                            You see it only for Abraham and (unintelligible). You don't see it before Abraham at all.\r\n                            26:02\r\n                            You notice here, verse 2, [71:2] He said, \"O my people, I am a manifest warner to you.\r\n                            26:10\r\n                            [71:3] \"To alert you that you shall worship GOD, reverence Him, and obey me. [71:4] \"He will then forgive you.... And so on.\r\n                            26:15\r\n                            So throughout the Quran, Noah was always saying \" just believe in God\" because the people were so primitive\r\n                            26:21\r\n                            that believing in God would have assured them enough growth to make it to Heaven.\r\n                            26:31\r\n                            But then the duties in Islam came through Abraham, or the Jews, or Christians, and us.\r\n                            26:41\r\n                            A man: Noah was one of the messengers or prophets? The messenger: Yes, he's named in the Quran as a prophet.\r\n                            26:49\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible).\r\n                            26:57\r\n                            The messenger: Scripture-based. Adam was a prophet because he delivered the message, a new message which was not in existence before.\r\n                            27:10\r\n                            A woman: So, because Noah delivered this new message, he's referred to as a prophet?\r\n                            27:16\r\n                            The messenger: He had a new message. He had new information that the people didn't have before. He delivered it to them.\r\n                            27:25\r\n                            He's named in the Quran as a prophet.\r\n                            27:43\r\n                            You mean the words? Yes. Yes.\r\n                            27:53\r\n                            Maybe, it was Al-Fãtehah. We don't know. The word that we know couldn't mean Al-Fãtehah, because the Ibrahim Al-Fãtehah is very close to what we read Al-Fãtehah now, the sound and meaning.\r\n                            new world had “no bacterial viruses”.\r\n                            28:10\r\n                            What we're taught is that Adam was given words, so he would be redeemed. And I'm sure he passed on these words to his children, and grandchildren, great grandchildren, great-great-great-grandchildren.\r\n                            28:23\r\n                            There's somebody. They had no bacterial viruses, those people, they had a clean world.\r\n                            28:42\r\n                            If there are no more questions, Professor Bashar will go on to 72.\r\n                            28:52\r\n                            Apamea: Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem [72:1] Say, \"I was inspired that a group of jinns listened, then said, 'We have heard a wonderful Quran.*\r\n                            29:04\r\n                            [72:2] \"'It guides to righteousness, and we have believed in it; we will never set up any idols besides our Lord.\r\n                            29:12\r\n                            [72:3] \"'The Most High is our only Lord.

And here they are talking about how they heard this wonderful Quran and about its guidance to righteousness.\r\n                            31:56\r\n                            And they're basically talking about everything that, for instance, a messenger would tell us, you know, how God doesn't have a mate nor a son, and how foolish our people are to utter such nonsense about God.\r\n                            32:19\r\n                            Here, this Sura is very important because we have the messenger of God here with us.\r\n                            32:28\r\n                            And \"Rashada\" is mentioned here, as we see it in the footnote in the second page, four times in this Sura.\r\n                            32:39\r\n                            And it's in Aya 2, which is righteousness, the word righteousness.\r\n                            32:49\r\n                            Also, Aya 14, on second page, which at the end is \"the right path.\"\r\n                            32:57\r\n                            And Aya 21, which we'll cover later, at the end, \"guide you.\"\r\n                            33:02\r\n                            And Aya 24, is it? No, wait a minute.\r\n                            33:16\r\n                            Oh yeah, \"redeem.\" So, the root \"Rashada\" is mentioned here 4 times.\r\n                            33:27\r\n                            And here, anyhow, these are these jinns talking about God and saying how ignorant some of these human beings were.\r\n                            33:35\r\n                            They gave power to jinns and tried to go to them and get some strength.\r\n                            33:43\r\n                            The messenger: (unintelligible) correction. (unintelligible) correction. 2 mathematical codes...\r\n                            34:03\r\n                            The messenger: I'm sorry. Go ahead. Apamea: That's Ok. Apamea: To go back to... I'm jumping around here. To go back to Aya 3,\r\n                            34:13\r\n                            [72:3] \"'.... He never had a mate, nor a son. [72:3] \"'The Most High is our only Lord. He never had a mate, nor a son.\r\n                            34:21\r\n                            This is so clear. In Iran, we were taught in the school, you know, we had the class of Deen, which was religion. But we were only studying Islam.\r\n                            34:32\r\n                            And we were always taught that there's only one God and he has no children.\r\n                            34:37\r\n                            And to me, and I didn't really know anything about Christianity when I was in Iran until when I was 13.\r\n                            34:44\r\n                            And then I learned about it. And to hear the fact that Christians have made Jesus, you know, so big and the son of God.\r\n                            34:55\r\n                            And you ask them, you know, \"you're referring to Jesus as the son of God.\" And then they go on talking about Christianity and all of a sudden they say \"the Lord.\"\r\n                            35:04\r\n                            And I said \"who's the Lord?\" \"Jesus Christ.\" And I said, wait a minute, wait a minute. You were just telling me that you're saying \"Christ is the son of God.\" And now you're saying \"he's God.\"\r\n                            35:13\r\n                            He can either be the son or he can be God. You cannot be, you know, two things in one.\r\n                            35:20\r\n                            And they were saying \"oh, that's different.\" But God and Jesus are different. And you can't even compare this to a simple example of \"hey, you can't be two people\" and you know...\r\n                            35:30\r\n                            So, that was really outrageous to me. And to this day, I still have discussions with Christians who practice their faith.\r\n                            35:37\r\n                            And it just goes back to the same thing. \"Hey, listen\" and I say \"God has no son, no mate, nothing,\" you know.\r\n                            35:45\r\n                            It just goes back and forth and we never get anywhere. Because they just believe what they believe. But here's a jinn. You know, the jinns are saying\r\n                            35:52\r\n                            [72:3] \"'The Most High is our only Lord. He never had a mate, nor a son. It makes me feel so good when I read about these jinns because, you know, these jinns are Muslims, you know. And I think...\r\n                            36:03\r\n                            And so many times at the mosque here, we're taught that, IN SHAA ALLAH, we'll turn our jinn into a Muslim.\r\n                            36:10\r\n                            You know, our worth of righteousness.\r\n                            36:16\r\n                            So that's the point for the Christians, the Aya 3. And again, how these foolish people utter nonsense about God.\r\n                            36:25\r\n                            And how they go to the jinns and they want strength from them. And, you know, to seek power from the jinns reminds me of devil worshipers.\r\n                            36:38\r\n                            I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but I think of it like witch power, you know.\r\n                            36:43\r\n                            All that stuff that people do when you see on TV, all these talk shows. They concentrate on it so much for a couple of months.\r\n                            36:51\r\n                            And it makes you aware of what's really going on. Someone that you may be dealing with every day. You don't know what their practices are. And this person from Pima College, you know, the director.\r\n                            37:04\r\n                            And here they are showing on TV now, you know, that she practices devil worshiping and this and that.\r\n                            37:12\r\n                            So they're trying to get power from the jinns. Or getting strength from Satan. But it's all nonsense.\r\n                            37:26\r\n                            And every time people think that there's never gonna be another messenger.\r\n                            37:32\r\n                            And they don't appreciate the messenger until the messenger is gone. Like when you don't appreciate a talented actor, you know, or singer or something until they're gone. And then you just basically make them so big.\r\n                            37:47\r\n                            And this is really like that. Who was it... after Joseph? Well, no... who was it... after some messenger\r\n                            37:54\r\n                            that they thought there was gonna be no other messengers. The messenger: It was Joseph, yeah.\r\n                            37:59\r\n                            But that is not true. And we see it continuously, messenger after messenger, prophet after prophet.\r\n                            38:06\r\n                            So, these jinns are trying to go towards Heaven and peek in and see what's going on there.\r\n                            38:13\r\n                            And there are guards there and projectiles. And they try to listen and \"boom,\" there's a projectile coming to them.\r\n                            38:22\r\n                            And they basically cannot get in and it's just impossible.\r\n                            38:30\r\n                            But you know, this makes me wonder. It says on Aya 9,\r\n                            38:35\r\n                            [72:9] \"'We used to sit there in order to spy. Anyone who listens is pursued by a powerful projectile. But these jinns are talking about how they enjoyed this wonderful Quran, how foolish among us were the ones who used to utter nonsense about God.\r\n                            38:51\r\n                            And the ones that go to jinns to seek power. And here they're saying \"we used to sit there in order to spy.\" They're still not allowed even though they accept it.\r\n                            Explains Jinn’s spying.\r\n                            39:02\r\n                            The messenger: They are talking \"the bad ones who tell us about their power, what powers they have, what characteristics. And \"used to\" is in the past.\r\n                            39:12\r\n                            The messenger: \"We used to.\" This means they can travel billions of light years. \"To spy\" means to get some information. For example, Apamea: So, \"we used to\" before they were...\r\n                            39:23\r\n                            The messenger: we went through a period of a year and a half or two years where we could not send any rockets into space.\r\n                            39:31\r\n                            The limit was 74 seconds. In Europe, in Japan, United States, we went through that period. Something mysterious. They hit something.\r\n                            39:40\r\n                            74 seconds. Including the shuttle. The space shuttle. 74, actually 76 seconds.\r\n                            39:48\r\n                            And this is... the jinn would see that, see what happened. Something obviously came close to the Earth during that time and prevented any of our rockets from penetrating.\r\n                            40:00\r\n                            Now, the jinns could see that. So, this is what \"spying\" means. They get some advanced information. They see something happening.\r\n                            40:10\r\n                            The messenger: I'll come back to this. Apamea: There's so much information in this Sura. The messenger: There's a lot of information here.\r\n                            40:16\r\n                            The messenger: When you finish this section, l will go back to the beginning. This is a lot of fun. We're gonna have a lot of fun with this Sura, IN SHAA ALLAH.\r\n                            40:24\r\n                            Apamea: It teaches us so much. Because my teacher taught me a lot today. And I just, I never realized all this, all these things. The messenger: There's a lot.\r\n                            40:35\r\n                            Apamea: Ok. Aya 10, [72:10] \"'We have no idea if something bad is intended for the inhabitants of Earth, or if their Lord wills to redeem them.\r\n                            40:44\r\n                            Of course, they have no information. They don't know anything. And here they are mentioning us, the Earth, the inhabitants of Earth.\r\n                            40:52\r\n                            And what God's plan is for us. They don't know. We don't know. And later on, we learn that not even Muhammad knows what's gonna happen to us. All they do is give us the message and tell us what's awaiting us.\r\n                            41:06\r\n                            But they don't know what's gonna happen to each one of us, particularly. And the jinns say \"some of us are righteous and some of us are less than righteous and follow various paths.\"\r\n                            41:28\r\n                            I don't know, I kind of find this interesting how you sort of perceive jinns as bad guys.\r\n                            41:34\r\n                            And here are the bad guys that are turning good.\r\n                            41:40\r\n                            And the good group are saying \"some of us are righteous and some are less than righteous.\" Again, they're dividing again.\r\n                            41:51\r\n                            You know, it's just division within division to me. And we're following various paths.\r\n                            42:01\r\n                            And they are so aware. They know that they can never run away from God on Earth or anywhere else. You cannot get away from God. God is there. God is with you, everywhere you are.\r\n                            42:13\r\n                            Through goodness in life, through adversity in life, God is always with us.\r\n                            42:19\r\n                            And the angels that are assigned to us will always remain with us. And these jinns are very well aware of that.\r\n                            42:29\r\n                            [72:13] \"'When we heard the guidance, we believed therein. Anyone who believes in his Lord will never fear any injustice, nor any affliction.\r\n                            42:37\r\n                            This is such a reassurance to me again and again, you know.\r\n                            42:45\r\n                            We have the guidance here and we believe in it. And what a wonderful feeling it is. And I can feel what these jinns are saying. They're spirit, you know.\r\n                            42:57\r\n                            How wonderful they feel. You know, they're so happy about what's happened to them. And they are so sure about it.\r\n                            43:06\r\n                            And they're saying anyone who believes in his Lord will never fear any injustice.\r\n                            43:13\r\n                            So many times through life, recently for me for instance, a few things may happen that are a few headaches. And as believers we think \"okay, wait a minute. What did I do wrong?\"\r\n                            43:26\r\n                            I've had this cold for two weeks, you know. And I've taken a whole thing of penicillin or whatever. And it's still staying in my nose. And it's driving me wild, you know.\r\n                            43:37\r\n                            And I know what was the problem. And as I let go of thinking so much about that particular problem, which is with my education.\r\n                            43:45\r\n                            Some problems happened with the committee and this and that. And I was so preoccupied with it. And I would cry about it.\r\n                            43:51\r\n                            And I was like \"oh, my life is ruined now.\" And you think like \"this is it. This is it.\"\r\n                            43:56\r\n                            Just because this process in my life has been delayed for a period of time, which is unknown to me,\r\n                            44:03\r\n                            My life is ruined. My future is ruined. I will not have any career. I'll just, you know, be at the hospital doing what I'm doing. And this injustice.\r\n                            44:12\r\n                            The lady drops out of my committee just like that. And that was an injustice to me, you know. And I was fearing that.\r\n                            44:22\r\n                            You know, I fell into it for a while. And my cold came on. And I was like \"boom, this is it. This is what's happened to me.\"\r\n                            44:28\r\n                            And two weeks later, three weeks later, I feel like I've let go of it. And I feel like \"okay, whatever happens, happens. I'm not gonna worry about it.\"\r\n                            44:37\r\n                            And here I'm trying to be a submitter again and saying that I will not fear any injustice nor any afflictions.\r\n                            44:45\r\n                            And God willing, things will clear away for me. And for the believers, this is the chance that we have. This is the privilege, you know.\r\n                            44:52\r\n                            And we can... God's promise is always true. And He never fails us.\r\n                            44:58\r\n                            So, again, I can put my trust into this Aya here. And, again, it will give me strength. Thank God.\r\n                            45:12\r\n                            Aya 14, [72:14] \"'Among us are the submitters, and among us are the compromisers.'\" As for those who submitted, they are on the right path.\r\n                            45:23\r\n                            This is, again, a factual type of a thing. Staring at us here, you submit and you're on the right path. Compromising will not get us anywhere.\r\n                            45:33\r\n                            And, as it says in ayah 15, [72:15] As for the compromisers, they will be fuel for Gehenna.\r\n                            45:39\r\n                            A person, a lay person out on the street, if they come and read this book, I mean, it just informs you about the past, the present of what you're supposed to do, and what's gonna happen to your future.\r\n                            45:51\r\n                            And, thank God for me, it was very clear. And the more I read it, the more it gives me guidance and strength to follow Islam, to follow God.\r\n                            46:01\r\n                            And it basically tells us, here's a jinn telling the story of, you know, \"some of us are true submitters and some of us are compromisers, but we know what's gonna happen to the compromisers.\"\r\n                            46:11\r\n                            They're gonna be fuel for Gehenna. And who wants to be....?\r\n                            46:16\r\n                            Apamea: Water gives life. Water gives life.\r\n                            46:22\r\n                            During the month of Ramadan, we were basically thirsty rather than hungry, and I noticed that.\r\n                            46:30\r\n                            So water is, again, the source of life here. We will be tested, definitely. And we know that.\r\n                            46:39\r\n                            Throughout the chapters, we are, it's mentioned to us several times, testing and even little quizzes as one of the brothers mentioned.\r\n                            46:50\r\n                            And if we disregard, [72:17] ....As for him who disregards the message of his Lord, He will direct him to ever increasing retribution.\r\n                            47:01\r\n                            And that is so clear. And who wants that retribution? I mean, if we have a bad day here, a headache, this and that, we think it's horrible.\r\n                            47:13\r\n                            And just to imagine that it's magnified so much for eternity, the retribution,\r\n                            47:23\r\n                            I don't know, or a nightmare. You get up in the morning and you think about the nightmare that you have and the problems that you felt in your night.\r\n                            47:32\r\n                            And just imagine that you would be living in that nightmare for eternity. That's just incredible to me.\r\n                            47:38\r\n                            And I don't want to be there. And I don't know how some people are so deaf and blind, knowingly.\r\n                            47:45\r\n                            This...You put them, this in front of them and they don't believe in it. They think it's just a myth. Or they can't think that far. Like Naghmeh was telling you about her friends.\r\n                            47:53\r\n                            They can't think that far as to Heaven and Hell. And some Muslims call it, some people like in Iran, you know, they call themselves Muslims, but they say \"oh, we don't believe in Heaven or Hell.\"\r\n                            48:03\r\n                            So, you don't know. But you tell them \"this is the Quran.\" And they were raised with the Quran.\r\n                            48:10\r\n                            But then again say \"I don't know. I don't believe in that stuff. This is the life. This is it. This is the real thing.\"\r\n                            48:17\r\n                            And they try to hold on to what they've got. But even at the hospital, I see this every day.\r\n                            48:23\r\n                            You see a doctor, a patient there who was a doctor, and they're ill.\r\n                            48:30\r\n                            What happened to all that dignity? What happened to all that money? Sometimes you don't see one single parent or family member there, one single friend.\r\n                            48:38\r\n                            They're just laying there without any food. They can't eat. Tubes are just, you know, all over the place. And what happened to their diet?\r\n                            48:47\r\n                            You know, it's not important. And I come home and I tell Naghmeh \"your health is the most important thing.\"\r\n                            48:52\r\n                            You know, being in Islam is so good. And what I tell my patients every day is \"thank God this, thank God that.\" And God willed he'll get out, and the patient will get out today. And this and that.\r\n                            49:04\r\n                            And that, amazingly enough, that gives a lot of people a lot of strength. And sometimes I see tears coming down their eyes.\r\n                            49:12\r\n                            Because all of a sudden they're reminded of God again. And that's the whole story.\r\n                            49:17\r\n                            Just believe in God, and He'll promise all these wonderful things. And you submit, and you're guided to the right path. And hey, everything's gonna work out.\r\n                            49:25\r\n                            Your health is gonna be there. Your happiness is gonna be there. Even you're gonna have a wonderful family and children. You're gonna have a wonderful job.\r\n                            49:30\r\n                            You're not gonna have any headaches. You're not gonna. have any colds that will last for two or three weeks. And you don't have to take any pills twice a day. And this is a promise to us.\r\n                            49:41\r\n                            And finally, Aya 18. [72:18] The places of worship belong to GOD; do not call on anyone else beside GOD.\r\n                            49:47\r\n                            Any other other name. This is very clear. Extremely clear.\r\n                            49:52\r\n                            As we mentioned to the Mohammedans, we know. I've never been to the mosque, and I don't wanna claim that I have been. But this is what I've heard.\r\n                            “Keep your Chasity” explained.\r\n                            50:00\r\n                            The name of Muhammad is mentioned besides God. And if they claim that they read this Quran and they know it so well, they should look at this Aya. And this is a sign for us.\r\n                            50:13\r\n                            Sometimes when we encounter people who worship prophet Muhammad, we can just refer them to this Aya.\r\n                            50:21\r\n                            [72:18] The places of worship belong to GOD; do not call on anyone else beside GOD. And thank God that this is what we know.\r\n                            50:30\r\n                            The messenger: I'm gonna come back and explain a little more about this. It's really very clear.\r\n                            50:38\r\n                            The location of this Sura is here, this mosque. I'm gonna talk to you about that. But before this, I see Amir is falling asleep.\r\n                            50:45\r\n                            He's joining the sleeping corner there. I'm gonna give him a quiz. Because the subject I'm gonna talk about 10 more minutes. Last time, we didn't talk about it enough. Amir asked me a question. I knew it was coming.\r\n                            50:56\r\n                            He said \"what does it mean to keep your chastity?\" I knew it was coming. So, I answered him. I wonder if he remembers.\r\n                            51:04\r\n                            I have the quiz for you, Amir. What does keep your chastity mean?\r\n                            51:16\r\n                            The messenger: Well, listen. Your dad doesn't know. I don't care. Your dad is old enough. I don't care if he knows or not. I wonder if you know.\r\n                            51:29\r\n                            Sometimes the older people don't know, Amir. See, this is... You know, Amir reminds me of a joke when...\r\n                            51:37\r\n                            This shows the generation gaps. How much more educated the new generations are.\r\n                            51:43\r\n                            This father, his son reads, is coming close to the age of maturity. So,\r\n                            51:50\r\n                            he puts his hand on the shoulder of his son and says \"son, I think it is time now to talk about the facts of life.\"\r\n                            51:57\r\n                            And the boy said \"okay dad, what do you wanna know?\" So, Amir is saying the same thing.\r\n                            52:03\r\n                            Okay, Amir, what is keep your chastity? I thought so.\r\n                            52:12\r\n                            Try to remember. You can give me any idea. Do you have any idea about it?\r\n                            52:18\r\n                            This is why I wanna talk about it for ten more minutes. Ok. I'm gonna repeat it and I'm gonna ask you again next week, okay?\r\n                            52:24\r\n                            So, you better remember. Keep your chastity means you keep yourself for your wife.\r\n                            52:30\r\n                            You're gonna grow up someday and have a wife and children, right?\r\n                            52:36\r\n                            And you want that person to be very special. So, you want to keep yourself for your wife.\r\n                            52:41\r\n                            You're not gonna have any relationship with any other girl until you meet the girl that you're going to marry that is your wife.\r\n                            52:49\r\n                            This is what keep your chastity means. Because in this country, we live in a strange environment here.\r\n                            52:57\r\n                            As soon as the children hit five, they start talking about boyfriends and girlfriends.\r\n                            53:03\r\n                            Now, they can do this, but they will pay a lot. It's too expensive for them.\r\n                            53:08\r\n                            Because when they do this, they're breaking God's law. And they have to pay for it when they grow up. They have a miserable life with their spouses.\r\n                            53:17\r\n                            So, this means the boy keeps himself until he doesn't go for all this dating business and boyfriend business and girlfriend business.\r\n                            53:25\r\n                            You have to resist that temptation. You're gonna be under a lot of temptation in the next years or so, even maybe now.\r\n                            53:33\r\n                            Do you have girls who like you at school? No?\r\n                            53:41\r\n                            Do you like any girls at school? See, this is what I mean. See, this is what I mean. You have to resist the temptation to reach for those girls and touch them.\r\n                            53:52\r\n                            See, because you want to keep yourself for the one that will share your life forever.\r\n                            53:58\r\n                            And if you do this, which is very difficult, it's not easy. You do this, God will guarantee you a perfect life.\r\n                            54:07\r\n                            Our girls also have to keep themselves until they have the man that will be their husband.\r\n                            54:17\r\n                            See, I know Poopak is listening. Don't be embarrassed. We all grow up and we get married.\r\n                            54:24\r\n                            But because we want you to be happy, you have to forget about the traditions of this country.\r\n                            54:30\r\n                            They pay a high price for this. They call for the temptation, the boyfriend and the girlfriend and all this business.\r\n                            54:37\r\n                            And they think they're having fun, but then they pay dearly for it. When they grow up, we have to pay for all breaking God's law. Every time we break God's law, we have to pay for it.\r\n                            54:48\r\n                            So, if you want to be happy, and we want you to be happy, you must resist the temptations in this country.\r\n                            54:55\r\n                            And you must have your own... God's law rules your life. Because, see, verse 13 here says when... No, not 13.\r\n                            55:05\r\n                            Yes, 13. [72:13] \"'When we heard the guidance, we believed therein. Anyone who believes in his Lord will never fear any injustice, nor any affliction.\r\n                            55:17\r\n                            So, if you want a life that doesn't have any fear, no affliction, no misery, you must be very strong.\r\n                            55:25\r\n                            You must resist all temptation to fall for the things that happen around us here and in other places.\r\n                            55:33\r\n                            [72:13] \"'When we heard the guidance, we believed therein... This is the guidance from God, and he's telling us \"you must keep yourself with your spouse.\"\r\n                            55:41\r\n                            If you're a boy, you must keep yourself, you don't touch another girl until the person will be your wife forever.\r\n                            55:48\r\n                            And if you're a girl, you keep yourself untouched until the person that will be your husband.\r\n                            55:55\r\n                            Then, you'll have a very happy life. You'll be proud of yourself. If you fall for the temptation, you're gonna be ashamed of yourself for the rest of your life, if you didn't keep yourself with the one that married you.\r\n                            56:08\r\n                            So, this is what verse 13 means. And God wants you to learn this. Last time, remember the commandment, \"you must keep your chastity.\" This is what it means.\r\n                            56:18\r\n                            It was verse 29 of the last Sura. And now in verse 13, God is telling us, [72:13] \"'When we heard the guidance, we believed therein.\r\n                            56:26\r\n                            The guidance is \"you don't follow the traditions other than God's law.\"\r\n                            56:32\r\n                            You're gonna be in school. You're gonna hear about boyfriends and girlfriends, and they will come and invite you.\r\n                            56:38\r\n                            They will want to touch you and all these things. But you must tell them \"I follow God's law and I cannot go along with these traditions. I have my own traditions.\"\r\n                            56:49\r\n                            And if you're strong, then you're guaranteed a perfectly happy life. And pass it on to all your Muslim friends.\r\n                            56:57\r\n                            If you really care for them and you want them to be happy, this is what you pass on to them. Okay?\r\n                            Jinns visited the Masjid. Quranic Events past and future.\r\n                            57:04\r\n                            These are the 10 minutes. I'm gonna ask Amir next week and maybe ask the two of you. So, you remember that.\r\n                            57:10\r\n                            No, no, no, no. I don't wanna scare you away. Don't worry. I know you'll never forget because you want to be happy.\r\n                            57:17\r\n                            Okay, Sura 72 teaches us about the jinns.\r\n                            57:23\r\n                            And it has to do with our mosque here because of the following reasons.\r\n                            57:29\r\n                            You see, verse 4 tells us that these jinns were companions. I want to correct something that Apamea may have missed, again.\r\n                            57:35\r\n                            Remember, jinns are free companions of humans.\r\n                            57:42\r\n                            Our companions are not called jinns yet. They will be when we die and they are free, they become jinns.\r\n                            57:49\r\n                            So, the jinns that heard this Quran were passing by on 6th street and they decided to walk into Masjid Tucson.\r\n                            57:54\r\n                            And they heard the Quran. And they are jinns who were companions of Christians, believing that God had a mother, Mary, and a son, Jesus, and so on.\r\n                            58:07\r\n                            Because verse 4 says, [72:4] \"'It is the foolish among us who used to utter such nonsense about GOD.\r\n                            58:12\r\n                            The nonsense is in verse 3. [72:3] \"'The Most High is our only Lord. He never had a mate, nor a son.\r\n                            58:18\r\n                            They are surprised. They walked in here. And they heard the Quran and they heard about the mathematical coding.\r\n                            58:24\r\n                            And they noticed the truth. And they believed. And they now realized that this nonsense that God has a mate and a son is really nonsense.\r\n                            58:39\r\n                            And only the foolish will believe that. So, this Sura has to do with us.\r\n                            58:47\r\n                            And... [72:1] Say, \"I was inspired that a group of jinns listened, then said, 'We have heard a wonderful Quran.*\r\n                            58:58\r\n                            You can say here, \"Say (O, Rashad),...\" if you wanna be accurate. I can't afford to be subtle about it anymore.\r\n                            59:07\r\n                            The Quran did not exist during the Prophet Muhammad's time. Did you know that?\r\n                            59:14\r\n                            Therefore, this does not apply to that time. The Prophet lived until he was 40 without any Quran, not one letter.\r\n                            59:23\r\n                            And when he was 55, he had only about one third of the Quran.\r\n                            59:29\r\n                            Quran was still being revealed until a few months, maybe weeks, before he died.\r\n                            59:36\r\n                            The Quran was not in the format that God intended for the world. It was written in the chronological sequence.\r\n                            59:43\r\n                            This Sura has the root name \"Rashada\" four times, more than any other Sura.\r\n                            59:48\r\n                            And if you add the gematrical value of Rashad Khalifa to the number of verses... the number of Sura, and the number of verses, you have a multiple of 19.\r\n                            59:57\r\n                            Rashad (رشاد) is 505, Khalifa (خلیفه) is 725, the number of Sura is 72, and the number of verses is 28.\r\n                            1:00:04\r\n                            So, we have a lot of mathematical confirmation that this Sura is about us, for this mosque here.\r\n                            1:00:11\r\n                            That the jinns wandered in here, and they are here with us now, listening. They are very regular as far as the Quranic studies are concerned.\r\n                            1:00:22\r\n                            I don't wanna spook out anybody, but they love it. This is why you read that among us are the Muslims, and among us are the compromisers. Verse 14.\r\n                            1:00:38\r\n                            And Muslims means total submitters to what God says. There is no compromising.\r\n                            1:00:49\r\n                            The messenger: Yes.\r\n                            1:00:58\r\n                            No, it was applicable. It was information about jinns. It was a lot of knowledge. But it will not apply to a place in Egypt, for example, or in Iran, or in Pakistan.\r\n                            1:01:08\r\n                            It was the jinns who are walking around there, will not believe that God has a mate and a son, generally.\r\n                            1:01:18\r\n                            The Quran is valid for all times, but there are certain things, for example,... For example, Rabbi Judah the pious is mentioned in 46:10.\r\n                            1:01:28\r\n                            Rabbi Judah was in the 11th century. The Quran came down in the 7th century.\r\n                            1:01:35\r\n                            So, there were 4 centuries before Rabbi Judah. There is a Sura about the smoke, which hasn't happened yet.\r\n                            1:01:42\r\n                            But it's still valid, and it is consistent with the punishments that came to the previous generations.\r\n                            1:01:49\r\n                            Gog and Magog has not reappeared yet.\r\n                            1:01:55\r\n                            The splitting of the moon happened only in 1969. So, all these things are still valid and there is a lot of information in all of them.\r\n                            1:02:05\r\n                            But this Sura now, this Sura is about Masjid Tucson.\r\n                            1:02:36\r\n                            These are the jinns who wandered in here, they know the truth. There are jinns who are lost and ignorant and just as Christians, as any Christian, or Jewish as any Jew, or Atheists as any Atheist.\r\n                            1:02:49\r\n                            The messenger: This is a group of jinns who came in here and they believed. A woman: These are jinns who not converted...\r\n                            1:02:55\r\n                            The messenger: No, they were converted afterwards. Yes. So, the jinns do change afterwards.\r\n                            Jinns giving more time to explore. Jinns explained in detail.\r\n                            1:03:02\r\n                            I was wondering about this for a while. Because the jinns are so strong with Satan, initially. They need... God gave them a longer period of time and more chance of seeing the universe.\r\n                            1:03:18\r\n                            See, this whole creation is for the humans and the jinns to redeem themselves.\r\n                            1:03:25\r\n                            We were kind of marginal, but the jinns were still firmly with Satan.\r\n                            1:03:32\r\n                            So, their opinion is stronger on the side of Satan. And God is giving them more of a chance.\r\n                            1:03:40\r\n                            Because on the Day of Judgment, the humans and the jinns who go to Hell will not have any excuse.\r\n                            1:03:47\r\n                            The jinns will not say \"if you gave us enough time we would have abandoned our strong alliance with Satan.\"\r\n                            1:03:52\r\n                            They cannot say that. A woman: So what is... when you say they read the Quran when they... Because it is also in the Quran. I understand this that they read the Quran...\r\n                            1:04:08\r\n                            The messenger: No, this is a result of them reading the Quran.\r\n                            1:04:13\r\n                            The messenger: They knew... in other words, they reached the conclusion that is... A woman: Oh, they reached the conclusion? The messenger: Yes.\r\n                            1:04:19\r\n                            A woman: Ok. So, it's not going to happen... more like they now... The messenger: They knew as a result of reading the Quran because the first verse says\r\n                            1:04:29\r\n                            [72:1] \"....a group of jinns listened, then said, 'We have heard a wonderful Quran.*\r\n                            1:04:34\r\n                            Now, when they heard the wonderful Quran, they learned a lot. Those were ignorant jinns walking around believing in Christianity, the trinity.\r\n                            1:04:44\r\n                            They were companions of Christians. And when they were freed, they had that belief in them.\r\n                            1:04:51\r\n                            Then, they found Masjid Tucson. They walked there and they discovered the Quran. They discovered there is a miracle on the wall.\r\n                            1:04:59\r\n                            And they have more capabilities to understand the code easier than us.\r\n                            1:05:07\r\n                            So, these are converted jinns. I mean, it's really very clear. [72:1] Say, \"I was inspired that a group of jinns listened, then said, 'We have heard a wonderful Quran.*\r\n                            1:05:18\r\n                            We are a generation that when we were born, the Quran was in existence.\r\n                            1:05:24\r\n                            During the Prophet Muhammad's time, people were born and there was no Quran.\r\n                            1:05:29\r\n                            [72:2] \"'It guides to righteousness, and we have believed in it; .... So, they changed.\r\n                            1:05:37\r\n                            [72:2] ....we will never set up any idols besides our Lord. Now, notice the things that we say here in this mosque and they repeat.\r\n                            1:05:43\r\n                            Like in verse 13, this is something we always say at this mosque and they believe it now.\r\n                            1:05:49\r\n                            They are simply repeating what we say here. [72:13] \"'.....Anyone who believes in his Lord will never fear any injustice, nor any affliction.\r\n                            1:05:57\r\n                            They actually go back to their people and they say this. And they heard it here.\r\n                            1:06:09\r\n                            Some of these verses also are to teach us some characteristics of the jinns. [72:11] \"'Some of us are righteous, and some are less than righteous; ....\r\n                            1:06:17\r\n                            Because they go and talk to their Christian jinns and they tell them \"oh, this is nonsense. The Lord Jesus will save us. He died for our sins.\"\r\n                            1:06:25\r\n                            Same things that you go through. And they do talk some of them into coming with them back here and say \"come and listen.\"\r\n                            1:06:36\r\n                            So, some are guided and some are not. \"We used to listen to the sky,\" it tells us what kind of power they have also.\r\n                            1:06:52\r\n                            It's a very confusing subject so don't be...\r\n                            1:07:09\r\n                            No, no, no, they're talking about their kind. You think they are bad humans?\r\n                            1:07:16\r\n                            Are they bad human beings? No? No? Do you think they are bad human beings?\r\n                            1:07:24\r\n                            Ok, so if you talk about the human race, if you talk about the human race, you can say \"some of us are righteous and some are less than righteous.\"\r\n                            1:07:31\r\n                            They're talking about the jinn race. They're talking about the jinn beings, not talking about themselves.\r\n                            1:07:37\r\n                            Ok, is that clear now? Now, 12, [72:12] \"'We knew full well that we can never run away from GOD....\r\n                            1:07:43\r\n                            As a result of studying the Quran, they know now that they will be gathered for the Day of Judgment.\r\n                            1:07:50\r\n                            Yes, the ones... Yes.\r\n                            1:08:00\r\n                            Right. You can imagine yourself talking about the human race after reading the Quran. It's exactly the same.\r\n                            1:08:12\r\n                            And you will find the same thing is applicable. What God is teaching us here is that the jinns are like us.\r\n                            1:08:17\r\n                            Some of them are Muslims, some are atheists, some are Jewish and so on. Beth?\r\n                            1:08:27\r\n                            Those are future jinns. Those are future jinns. They are trapped in our body until we die.\r\n                            1:08:36\r\n                            They are companions. They are companions.\r\n                            1:08:42\r\n                            They are not part of your soul. Your soul has an independent person called \"Beth Khalifa.\" And the companion is an independent person called \"Beth Khalifa.\"\r\n                            1:08:52\r\n                            That... it's freed also. When you die, then the other Beth Khalifa becomes a jinn.\r\n                            1:08:57\r\n                            And stays around here about for 600 or 700 more years.\r\n                            1:09:02\r\n                            In your case, 300 years. Beth: So, we don't know what they'e doing. Is it part of us...?\r\n                            1:09:09\r\n                            The messenger: Oh, you mean after we die? Beth: Yeah. The messenger: Yeah. They're just floating around. Beth: They're not part of us?\r\n                            1:09:15\r\n                            The messenger: No, no. They're not part of us anymore. Now, they are part of us. They go wherever you go and...\r\n                            1:09:23\r\n                            Beth, this is very important. The companion is your number... is the major witness for or against us on the Day of Judgment\r\n                            1:09:34\r\n                            because this is a companion that's with you from birth to death, always, wherever you go. And she knows everything about you.\r\n                            1:09:44\r\n                            So, she makes a perfect witness. She's an eye witness, from inside out. I mean, what more perfect witness than that.\r\n                            1:09:53\r\n                            And the Sura 50 explains that. Sura 50. Parivash: Can we kill them? Can they watch us and we kill the (unintelligible) or something like that? Sometimes, can we kill? Can we...\r\n                            1:10:05\r\n                            The messenger: Your guards will not allow them to do that. Now, your companion is inside of you. you can kill the...\r\n                            1:10:12\r\n                            Like the example I use is you're watching TV and the Noon prayer comes.\r\n                            1:10:17\r\n                            And it's your companion that's telling you \"wait until the news is over.\" Then, you will miss the Prayer.\r\n                            1:10:23\r\n                            A woman: You know from examples like this, let's say I'm not (unintelligible), and it is almost like my body is just (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:10:33\r\n                            The messenger: All the evil. Yes, yes, yes, exactly, exactly, you're right, yes.\r\n                            1:10:46\r\n                            No, no, no. Ok. Right. Right, you're continuously changing them hopefully. Or you're totally submitting to them.\r\n                            1:10:56\r\n                            Your jinn is Satan's representative in your body, Satan's representative.\r\n                            1:11:02\r\n                            So, she is continuously telling you not to worship God alone, to worship (unintelligible), and so on.\r\n                            1:11:11\r\n                            So, this is what she's doing, to stop you from the five Prayers, to discourage you from fasting in the month of Ramadan,\r\n                            1:11:18\r\n                            to tell you to follow the social system, have a boyfriend or a girlfriend,\r\n                            1:11:23\r\n                            like they do in this country and so on. She is always telling you to do the bad things. Now, you are supposed to represent God's point of view, worship God alone, develop the soul, grow,\r\n                            1:11:35\r\n                            do the five Prayers, fast the month of Ramadan, follow the moral system that God dictates,\r\n                            1:11:43\r\n                            There is continuous debate in your head between you and your Satan representative.\r\n                            1:11:49\r\n                            Now, when this body dies, then both souls are freed, and we go to the world of souls and the jinn stays around for a few hundred more years.\r\n                            1:12:00\r\n                            So this, the word \"jinn\" implies they are free companions.\r\n                            1:12:25\r\n                            A woman: Is the number of the humans equal to the number of jinns who are virgins that get assigned to humans?\r\n                            1:12:34\r\n                            The messenger: Yes, the number of human and number of jinns are equal, but not at this time on Earth. There are jinns from the past generations.\r\n                            1:12:51\r\n                            roughly yes, roughly equal.\r\n                            Ranks in Heaven.\r\n                            1:13:10\r\n                            No, no, no, not necessarily.\r\n                            1:13:23\r\n                            Yes, higher than some angels. Yes. The angels will be distributed in the Heaven at all levels,\r\n                            1:13:30\r\n                            just like...see, when we go back, we need to go back, rejoin God's Kingdom in the way we were before, before the feud happened, before the great feud.\r\n                            1:13:41\r\n                            But we can exceed where we were, depending on how much we develop our soul.\r\n                            1:13:48\r\n                            See, we were in Heaven, and we were in a different rank. I mean, in a particular specific rank.\r\n                            1:13:56\r\n                            And then we committed that crime, so we fell here. Now, our job is to redeem ourselves.\r\n                            1:14:02\r\n                            And we can redeem ourselves to the same rank, or to higher, or lower, depending on how hard we work, or how much we develop our soul.\r\n                            1:14:13\r\n                            So, when we go back, we're gonna fit back into God's Kingdom among the angels. We just go back to the same situation as before the feud, only with a new rank, depending on what we did.\r\n                            1:14:26\r\n                            Does that clarify this? So, some of the angels will be lower than us, if we develop ourselves sufficiently.\r\n                            1:14:38\r\n                            If you develop yourself to the max, you can be at the highest level, with the highest angels, archangels.\r\n                            1:15:01\r\n                            Yes, it's possible to be in a different stage, but this will affect the weakness of the human.\r\n                            1:15:11\r\n                            Apamea: Dr. Khalifa, what is this in the first Aya, it is \"I was inspired?\"\r\n                            1:15:27\r\n                            The messenger: See, the \"say\" is to a messenger. [72:1] ....\"I was inspired that a group of jinns listened,...\r\n                            1:15:35\r\n                            Actually, I find that I said this before I made the connection between the Sura and myself.\r\n                            1:15:42\r\n                            I said this in the past. As long as 10 years ago, when we read this Sura, I said that the jinns come in here and they listen to us and they make this connection.\r\n                            1:15:56\r\n                            Edip: Also, during the time of Prophet Muhammad, Muhammad has been addressed that say \"I was inspired.\"\r\n                            1:16:06\r\n                            Edip: Because Prophet Muhammad is the first person that received these verses from God, but this now happens a second time.\r\n                            1:16:17\r\n                            Edip: And there are many prophecies here, but we cannot say that Prophet Muhammad has not been addressed.\r\n                            1:16:29\r\n                            The messenger: We cannot say that he has either. Most probably, he was not, because there was no Quran.\r\n                            1:16:35\r\n                            Edip: But Quran, now we do Quranic study. If we recite a part of Quran, we can say this is Quran. For verses of Quran, we can say Quran.\r\n                            1:16:47\r\n                            They didn't hear all the Quran, but part of the Quran, we can say Quran.\r\n                            1:16:53\r\n                            (72:1) سَمِعْنَا قُرْءَانًا عَجَبًۭا or some verses from Quran. The messenger: Ok. (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:17:10\r\n                            It's very possible. No, I didn't hear the whole question.\r\n                            1:17:15\r\n                            I didn't hear the whole question. They don't know the future.\r\n                            1:17:32\r\n                            They'll be at the same stage as the people around the Prophet. Same stage as the Prophet and the people around him.\r\n                            1:17:43\r\n                            Yes. No. Okay.\r\n                            1:18:04\r\n                            This is demon possession. Some of them are mischievous.\r\n                            1:18:14\r\n                            Yes. This is a rare thing. Has anybody here seen a demon possessed person?\r\n                            1:18:23\r\n                            See, it's rare. Only if you want to, see the movie \"Exorcist.\" It's a great exaggeration based on a true story.\r\n                            1:18:34\r\n                            Ok. Back to Apamea. Only ten minutes.\r\n                            1:18:43\r\n                            Yeah.\r\n                            1:19:20\r\n                            The messenger: No, this is, the place of worship is in the act of worship. When you do the prayer, or the fasting, or the Hajj must be devoted to God alone.\r\n                            1:19:31\r\n                            In the Khutba and in the Quranic study, in the Quran and so on, the Quran itself says \"mention in connection with the scripture, Abraham, Mary, Pharaoh.\" The Quran itself says that. So,...\r\n                            1:19:54\r\n                            No, I would, since it is places of worship.\r\n                            1:20:15\r\n                            See, if you read Sura 19, it tells you (19:16) وَٱذْكُرْ فِى ٱلْكِتَـٰبِ Mentioned in the book, or any connection with it.\r\n                            1:20:22\r\n                            It mentions Mary, or Jesus, or Pharaoh, and so on, and Abraham, those names.\r\n                            1:20:30\r\n                            So, when you study the Quran, or you're learning from history, you have to mention these names.\r\n                            1:20:37\r\n                            Only because God said so. But when it comes to the act of worship, you must devote it to God completely.\r\n                            1:20:48\r\n                            Yes. Edip: Rashad, you mean mentioning, there are difference between two mentioning.\r\n                            1:20:58\r\n                            Edip: For example, when you praise God, you are praising God, b. t if you mention somebody else, he's mentioning his worship.\r\n                            1:21:07\r\n                            Edip: Allah avoid us this kind of mentioning.\r\n                            1:21:15\r\n                            Edip: For example, in Islam, you praise God, and you call to God, and you add somebody's name,\r\n                            1:21:23\r\n                            for example, Muhammad or Ali's name, and also you are calling for prayer.\r\n                            1:21:28\r\n                            Prayer is a connection with God, a contact with God. Edip: And here, in this situation, when you mention other names, this is a position of worship.\r\n                            1:21:44\r\n                            The messenger: It must be devoted to God alone, the act of worship. But here we are studying, like now, for example, we are studying the Quran.\r\n                            1:21:52\r\n                            The Quran said, tells you to mention these names to learn from the history.\r\n                            1:21:59\r\n                            So, mentioning it then in this context is okay. I see your point, Edip.\r\n                            1:22:09\r\n                            I wanna make it as difficult as possible, because no matter what understanding or interpretation you may reach, you'll be taking a chance if you mention anybody else's name in the acts of worship.\r\n                            1:22:26\r\n                            Like, we do the prayer in the desert sometimes, a lot. Driving, we go in the desert, we go to the picnic area, and what this means in the picnic area, we should not mention Sharif or Mehdi?\r\n                            1:22:37\r\n                            A woman: I do not see the motivation for you to avoid this issue. There are people that really call on you to be a follower of the Prophet.\r\n                            1:22:45\r\n                            A woman: They always have the argument that you are not (unintelligible). So why do you refrain from doing this? Because it is a claim to avoid any possibility at all. It just seems to me like it is an enemy of the religion here.\r\n                            1:23:00\r\n                            The messenger: But the key words here are place of worship, or position of worship.\r\n                            1:23:05\r\n                            So, in the specific practices of worship, like Salat, and fasting, and Zakat, and Hajj,\r\n                            1:23:13\r\n                            and sacrificing animals, whatever, this must be devoted to God alone.\r\n                            1:23:20\r\n                            When you mention the name of God when an animal, it must be the name of God alone, no other names.\r\n                            1:23:26\r\n                            And I wanna go back to, when you do the prayer in the picnic area, when you stand up for the prayer, you mention only the name of God in the prayer.\r\n                            1:23:35\r\n                            As soon as you say Al-Salaamu ‘Alaykum, you say \"congratulations, Douglas.\" So, you mention Douglas. But it is not part of the worship.\r\n                            1:23:44\r\n                            So, I want to make this very strict, but it goes without saying that when you are outside of the\r\n                            1:23:50\r\n                            the acts of worship, you can... the Quran itself says \"mention those names to learn from their history.\"\r\n                            God teacher of the Quran.\r\n                            1:24:37\r\n                            Okay, but you see, Rami, you have a very good point here, but remember that the teacher of Quran is God.\r\n                            1:24:45\r\n                            And for the sincere believers, God will see to it that they will reach the right conclusion, just like we are reaching it right now.\r\n                            1:24:54\r\n                            I'm not... they don't need me. I'm not the one who's teaching the Quran. God is teaching all of us right now.\r\n                            1:25:01\r\n                            Rami: But we are having some kind of contradiction...\r\n                            1:25:13\r\n                            The messenger: Well listen, if God guides them to mention no other name in the mosque under any circumstances,\r\n                            1:25:20\r\n                            we may be able to build a mosque right here in this area where there is a prayer hall where there is no other name is mentioned.\r\n                            1:25:26\r\n                            And our Quranic study will be in a place where we have chairs and a movie screen or a big TV or something.\r\n                            1:25:33\r\n                            That will be for the Quranic study. And when we go to the prayer hall, no other name will be mentioned in that hall.\r\n                            1:25:38\r\n                            If they do that, more power to them. They'll be wonderful. We may be able to do this some day, do it some day. But this is where the word compromisers comes in the picture.\r\n                            1:25:48\r\n                            As you see, it's only four verses before that.\r\n                            1:25:55\r\n                            If the message reaches, no. Remember that God is the teacher of the Quran to every generation.\r\n                            1:26:02\r\n                            And for the sincere believers, God sees to it that they reach the correct conclusions.\r\n                            1:26:08\r\n                            The insincere will always be sent astray, no matter how clear you can be.\r\n                            1:26:14\r\n                            So, this is a law in verse 18 that we can never compromise it.\r\n                            1:26:27\r\n                            Now, remember there is a law in the Quran that says if you are forced by circumstance\r\n                            1:26:32\r\n                            without being malicious or deliberate, you are committing no errors. So right now, our circumstances dictate on us that we use this same hall for prayer and for Quranic study and for potlucks and so on.\r\n                            1:26:43\r\n                            But the day will come when we're rich enough, IN SHAA ALLAH, we will have a complex\r\n                            1:26:49\r\n                            on this block where there is a prayer hall. But nothing goes on in it except prayer and only the name of God.\r\n                            Sermons “khutba” not part of the contact prayer.\r\n                            1:27:01\r\n                            Pardon? Yes.\r\n                            1:27:07\r\n                            Yes. Yeah, but the Khutba follows the instructions of the Quran. (19:16) وَٱذْكُرْ فِى ٱلْكِتَـٰبِ مَرْيَمَ (19:41) وَٱذْكُرْ فِى ٱلْكِتَـٰبِ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ ۚ\r\n                            1:27:15\r\n                            and use their history as lessons. This is Sura 28. Cause we're following the Quran in the Khutba.\r\n                            1:27:21\r\n                            Now the Khutba, the people are sitting listening. This is not part of the Contact Prayer.\r\n                            1:27:28\r\n                            Yes.\r\n                            1:28:08\r\n                            Yes, but that word has many meanings depending on the context.\r\n                            1:28:17\r\n                            When you say the name of Muhammad in the AZAN, you are worshipping Muhammad.\r\n                            1:28:23\r\n                            So, we can use \"mention\" or \"worship\" interchangeably in this situation.\r\n                            1:28:28\r\n                            When you mention Muhammad, 'ALE (آل) Muhammad, Ibrahim, 'ALE (آل) Ibrahim in the contact prayer, you're worshipping them.\r\n                            1:28:37\r\n                            The messenger: So, there is no difference. Dr. Sabahi: So, basically, I can agree....\r\n                            1:28:50\r\n                            The messenger: Do you have the Farsi translation there?\r\n                            1:29:01\r\n                            The messenger: I wanna go to the extreme and make it as difficult as possible to mention any other name under any circumstances in the mosque.\r\n                            1:29:09\r\n                            The messenger: But If I find it necessary, then this will fall under the Quranic law that if we are forced by circumstance, without being deliberate or malicious, we're not committing a mistake.\r\n                            1:29:20\r\n                            Edip: The word نَدْعُ, yes, has many different meanings in Quran. Edip: Not so many different nuances.\r\n                            1:29:28\r\n                            For example, in chapter 3:61, فَمَنْ حَآجَّكَ فِيهِ مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَكَ مِنَ ٱلْعِلْمِ فَقُلْ تَعَالَوْا۟ نَدْعُ (3:61) أَبْنَآءَنَا وَأَبْنَآءَكُمْ\r\n                            1:29:39\r\n                            Yes, نَدْعُ \"mention\" than \"call\", not \"worship of.\" The messenger: Invite. Edip: Invite.\r\n                            1:29:45\r\n                            Edip: Allah says to Muhammad \"say to them, let's invite.\"\r\n                            1:29:51\r\n                            (3:61) نَدْعُ أَبْنَآءَنَا وَأَبْنَآءَكُمْ Allah commands him worship your children, not worship, to call. And there are some different meanings, here.\r\n                            1:30:02\r\n                            The messenger: It's a word with multiple meanings.\r\n                            1:30:20\r\n                            Rami: ...To make it tougher to mention other than God during the Contact Prayers to worship Him.\r\n                            1:30:32\r\n                            Rami: But you are trying to make it more difficult to mention other names in the masjid grounds. We are not talking about disinvolving anything. Masjids, mosques, places of worship, mosques have traditionally been places of discussion.\r\n                            1:31:19\r\n                            The messenger: No, no, I want a separate hall for the Quranic study and a separate hall for the prayers.\r\n                            1:31:26\r\n                            I said \"ideally.\" Rami: So, we pray in our living rooms and we pray in our bedrooms. And we pray everywhere. The messenger: Right.\r\n                            1:31:37\r\n                            The messenger: What are you suggesting, Rami? Rami: Well, the translation as it is in Arabic is very clear. We should not mention other than God according to verses. The messenger: Right.\r\n                            1:31:51\r\n                            Rami: But the place of worship has nothing to do (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:31:58\r\n                            The messenger: OK, I wanna put you in the same position I was in. Go ahead and translate it. You see, the statement of the Quran is very....\r\n                            \r\n                            11 Quran Study From Behrouz 111 Sura 23;60 88 & Sura 16 01 18 199001 23 1990 Morning Before 01 31 19\r\n                            \r\n                            A man: Wow! The messenger: Right. (unintelligible). A man: Look at this whole place! The messenger: ...millions.\r\n                            0:05\r\n                            A man: What the hell is wrong? The messenger: It's too late for Russia.\r\n                            0:11\r\n                            A man: (Unintelligible). The messenger: Oh yeah! The messenger: This is why they have the picture like that! A man: Yeah.\r\n                            0:17\r\n                            The messenger: Look at that! Yes. Millions of people! A man: Butterflies!\r\n                            0:25\r\n                            The messenger: Yes. The messenger: This is... I mean, Gorbachev cannot fill all these.\r\n                            0:33\r\n                            The messenger: 21st century. The messenger: People in Russia are revolting.\r\n                            0:39\r\n                            The messenger: It's the most...\r\n                            0:44\r\n                            The messenger: You know, when they have a great number of people like this they always encourage each other. A man: Oh yes.\r\n                            0:51\r\n                            A man: No fear. The messenger: Yes.\r\n                            0:57\r\n                            The messenger: In fact, they were in Moscow, then they're gonna occupy Moscow. A man: Where do we start? The messenger: 346.\r\n                            1:18\r\n                            أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ Descriptions of the believers\r\n                            1:25\r\n                            [23:60] And they give their charities, while their minds know full well. For they will be summoned before their Lord,\r\n                            1:31\r\n                            [23:61] These are the ones who hasten to work righteousness; they're always far ahead.\r\n                            1:36\r\n                            The Disbelievers Unappreciative [23:62] We never burden any soul beyond its means, and we keep a record that presents the truth. No one will suffer injustice.\r\n                            1:46\r\n                            [23:63] Because their minds are oblivious to this, they commit works that do not conform with this; such are their works.\r\n                            1:54\r\n                            [23:64] Then, when we afflict their leaders with retribution, they complain.\r\n                            2:01\r\n                            [23:65] Do not complain; today, you cannot receive any help. [23:66] My revelations were recited to you, but you turned back on your heels.\r\n                            2:11\r\n                            [23:67] You were too arrogant to accept them. You disregarded them. [23:68] Have they not reflected on this scripture? Have they attained something never attained by their ancestors?\r\n                            2:22\r\n                            [23:69] Have they failed to recognize their messenger? Is this why they are disregarding him?\r\n                            2:27\r\n                            [23:70] Have they decided that he is crazy? Indeed, he has brought the truth to them, but most of them hate the truth.\r\n                            2:39\r\n                            [23:71] Indeed, if the truth was to follow their opinions, there would be chaos in the heavens and the earth and everything in them. We have given them their reminder, but they are disregarding their reminder.\r\n                            2:52\r\n                            The reminder here is the mathematical code. Because the word Zikr, the word Zikr. This is 438.\r\n                            3:10\r\n                            Yeah. It's 453.\r\n                            3:17\r\n                            She told them but they under-contained the messenger. She told them that Quran does contain a gift, the mathematical code,\r\n                            3:26\r\n                            a distinct code in Quran. The same word is used here.\r\n                            3:41\r\n                            72 [23:72] Are you asking them for any wage? Your Lord's wage is far better. He is the best Provider.\r\n                            3:49\r\n                            [23:73] Most assuredly, you are inviting them to a straight path. [23:74] It is those who disbelieve in the Hereafter and deviate from their path.\r\n                            3:58\r\n                            This is consistent with the criteria in the Quran about those who disbelieve in the Hereafter.\r\n                            4:03\r\n                            They follow other than the Quran. They don't like the Quran alone. They follow Hadith and Sunnah. When God Alone is mentioned, their hearts shrink with aversion.\r\n                            4:13\r\n                            [23:74] It is those who disbelieve in the Hereafter and deviate from their path. [23:75] Had we showered them with mercy, and relieved their adversities, they would have plunged deeper into their transgression.\r\n                            4:26\r\n                            [23:76] Even when we afflicted them with retribution, they never turned to their Lord. They never implored.\r\n                            4:32\r\n                            [23:77] When we showered them with the well-deserved retribution, they were shocked.\r\n                            4:37\r\n                            [23:78] He is the One who granted you the hearing, the eyesight, and the brains. Rarely are you appreciative.\r\n                            4:44\r\n                            [23:79] He is the One who established you on earth, and before Him you will be summoned.\r\n                            4:50\r\n                            [23:80] He is the One who controls life and death, and He is the One who alternates the night and day. Do you not understand?\r\n                            4:58\r\n                            [23:81] They said what their ancestors said. [23:82] They said, \"After we die and turn into dust and bones, we get resurrected?\r\n                            5:09\r\n                            [23:83] \"Such promises were given to us and to our parents in the past. These are no more than tales from the past.\"\r\n                            5:18\r\n                            It's funny because in those ignorant generations, they demanded that their ancestors be brought back to life as a demonstration of resurrection.\r\n                            5:30\r\n                            This is what even today is happening, Susan Rey. Someday, people will come back to life, Hussein and Ali\r\n                            5:39\r\n                            and Fatima. She wants to see them come back to life. A man: She is expecting them. The messenger: Um-hum.\r\n                            5:47\r\n                            In fact, maybe in this Sura, ironically, the verse in this Sura which she uses to prove to her\r\n                            5:59\r\n                            that Ali, Hussein, Hasan, and Fatima, and others come back to life in this out of the dead.\r\n                            6:24\r\n                            It happens in every generation.\r\n                            6:35\r\n                            A woman: Can you talk about the retribution showering? Because the English showering is from above. The messenger: Um-hum.\r\n                            6:46\r\n                            When we showered them and they deserved retribution, they were shocked. 77.\r\n                            6:56\r\n                            They had quite a few problems like in 76. [23:76] Even when we afflicted them with retribution, they never turned to their Lord. They never implored.\r\n                            7:04\r\n                            Beirut, Lebanon is being used as an example in the midst of the Arabs. Beirut is the Ka'bah of the Arabs. They go there for fun.\r\n                            7:13\r\n                            They are a symbol of civilization, the closest thing to Europe Civilization.\r\n                            7:20\r\n                            Even from Iran, they used to go to Lebanon in the time of...\r\n                            7:25\r\n                            So, it was the center for all the Arab countries. .....Rome....\r\n                            7:30\r\n                            (unintelligible). over a long period of time.\r\n                            7:36\r\n                            (unintelligible) Sodom and Gomorrah.

The bee kingdom is quite elaborate.\r\n                            16:36\r\n                            It has a queen that is absolute authority in the bee hive. Only one Larva, the queen, she rules the whole hive. She is the mother of the whole hive.\r\n                            16:50\r\n                            And then there are the workers.

And then there are the workers\r\n                            17:14\r\n                            who supposedly provide food for the new babies. They go out. They are scouts.\r\n                            17:21\r\n                            They go look for food. They don't do anything else. They just scout. Then, they come back and they tell the rest of the workers where the food is.\r\n                            17:29\r\n                            To go northwest, 62 degrees For 3.3 miles, this is what they tell them.\r\n                            17:37\r\n                            So, the workers, sure enough, they rush 62 degrees, northwest, 3.3 miles.\r\n                            17:45\r\n                            Sometimes they mistake 3.2 miles, they find nothing. They \"hey, they said 3.3 miles.\" So, they go 0.1 more mile and sure enough, there's a cotton field.\r\n                            17:56\r\n                            They get their food, the nectar and the pollen. Two things that they get, nectar and pollen.\r\n                            18:04\r\n                            The nectar, they absorb in their stomach. Not their stomach, it's a place for... Maybe, it is the stomach.\r\n                            18:13\r\n                            I think it is the stomach. They take the nectar in the stomach. And the pollen, this is really something. They have pockets in their legs. Are you aware of this?\r\n                            18:24\r\n                            Most of you. They have pockets that are empty in their legs. And they have hairs like my hairs.\r\n                            18:31\r\n                            So, they get the pollen in the hairs and then they go like this to fill the pockets.\r\n                            18:36\r\n                            If you watch the bees, you can see them filling their pockets. And when the pocket gets really full, like this, you can see something with their legs, real big.\r\n                            18:46\r\n                            Then, they go back to the hive and they empty all this. They empty the nectar and the pollen, enter the enzymes in it, make the honey.\r\n                            18:55\r\n                            How about that for a design? Now, one bee will produce a tiny amount of honey, right?\r\n                            19:02\r\n                            But ten million bees... Again, like the carbon chain with this paper or this one. Billions of tons of paper, from the air.\r\n                            19:20\r\n                            A man: The queen dies. The messenger: The queen dies? A man: Yeah. The messenger: Then, the hive dies.\r\n                            19:27\r\n                            The messenger: They make false queens. A man: The eggs, they have special oil jelly. And then they make a queen.\r\n                            19:33\r\n                            The messenger: Oh, you mean the workers? A man: Yeah, the workers immediately go to work even though there is a (unintelligible) the hive.\r\n                            19:40\r\n                            The messenger: There are also false queens if the hive is not attended.\r\n                            19:45\r\n                            Sometimes inadvertently a new queen, of course not inadvertently, but this is to produce more hives, another queen will show up.\r\n                            19:54\r\n                            No, one of them will run away and they will go on a tree, you can see they are flying around the queen, all of them. And they don't sting.\r\n                            20:02\r\n                            You can take them and put around the place. See pictures of people with the beard of bees?\r\n                            20:10\r\n                            They are swarming. So, they can take it, get an empty hive, put them there, and they have a new hive.\r\n                            20:21\r\n                            And they know their hive, the place. They can go around the whole five-mile radius and they come back to their hive. They recognize it.\r\n                            20:29\r\n                            It's quite a...I took a course in bees and bee language.\r\n                            20:37\r\n                            Behrouz: They are normally, they put these boxes all together (unintelligible). The messenger: Um-hum.\r\n                            20:44\r\n                            The messenger: I know, but they know their own hive. 69.\r\n                            20:52\r\n                            [16:69] Then eat from all the fruits, following the design of your Lord, precisely. From their bellies....\r\n                            20:58\r\n                            Oh, there are also the males. They just sit around. They do nothing. Just mate with the queen when the time comes.\r\n                            21:08\r\n                            Only one of them .....Cause only one of them gets the job. The rest are killed. Kicked out.\r\n                            21:16\r\n                            \"We don't need you anymore.\" You can see them all dead around the hive outside after the mating.\r\n                            21:22\r\n                            This is the one time that the queen leaves the hive. And then it's a race.\r\n                            21:28\r\n                            Because she's very strong. So, the strongest drone, or male, is the one who can catch up with her.\r\n                            21:37\r\n                            Then, the rest are killed. Including the king. A man: Including the king? The messenger: Yes. A man: It's not worth it.\r\n                            21:48\r\n                            The messenger: It's not worth it, no? 69.\r\n                            21:56\r\n                            [16:69] Then eat from all the fruits, following the design of your Lord, precisely. From their bellies comes a drink of different colors, wherein there is healing for the people.\r\n                            22:08\r\n                            It was only discovered five or six years ago that honey will heal allergy.\r\n                            22:15\r\n                            If you're allergic to local pollen, you have to eat local honey. If something happens, it heals the allergy.\r\n                            22:25\r\n                            This was scientifically established. [16:69] ....This is a proof for people who reflect.\r\n                            22:32\r\n                            A man: Wow. It says milk and....what I mean, some milk and honey... milk and honey, they're both very good for mixing together though.\" Cause I used to do that. Cause it's a laxative.\r\n                            22:43\r\n                            The messenger: Yeah?\r\n                            22:49\r\n                            The messenger: I think you've got the wrong correlation there. No, I think when you drank that milk and honey, you went to McDonald's and had a bad hamburger.\r\n                            22:58\r\n                            Diarrhea. That's what you think.\r\n                            23:04\r\n                            Behrouz: So, I guess it's different with other people. Some people, they get that way when they drink hot milk, or (unintelligible) milk or oatmeal.\r\n                            23:14\r\n                            (Unintelligible). It has different effects on different people.\r\n                            23:21\r\n                            The messenger: No, you see, he probably had one bad experience, so he generalized. He can do that.\r\n                            23:29\r\n                            Behrouz: You know, I'm always happy, but not that happy.\r\n                            23:35\r\n                            The messenger: You drink honey and milk almost every morning. A man: Quite often. I know. A man: (unintelligible) The messenger: No, probably not.\r\n                            23:44\r\n                            The messenger: Mr. Somalia, what did you say? A man: You don't need honey for that. The messenger: You don't need what? Really? A man: No.\r\n                            23:53\r\n                            The messenger: Do you know what the percentage of fat in it? A man: It's a lot of fat. Not bad.\r\n                            24:03\r\n                            The messenger: Is it thick or light? The messenger: It's like skim milk, huh?\r\n                            24:09\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible).\r\n                            24:29\r\n                            Number 70. [16:70] And GOD created you, and He terminates your lives. He lets some of you live to the oldest age, only to find out that there is a limit to the knowledge they can acquire. GOD is Omniscient, Omnipotent.\r\n                            24:44\r\n                            [16:71] And GOD has provided for some of you more than others. Those who are given plenty would never give their properties to their subordinates to the extent of making them partners. Would they give up GOD's blessings?\r\n                            24:58\r\n                            71 in the new translation. Sorry Jahan, this is an old translation.\r\n                            Explains why God does not have partners.\r\n                            25:04\r\n                            In the new translation, they put a subtitle there. Because God is giving us an example. Why should we set up idols beside him? He said, we will not do that. We will not\r\n                            25:16\r\n                            give your servant half of your property or make him a partner to the point that you have to pay allegiance to your servant\r\n                            25:22\r\n                            as much as he or she pays allegiance to you. So, why should God give His benefit to His servants, Muhammad or Jesus?\r\n                            25:33\r\n                            72. [16:72] And GOD made for you spouses from among yourselves, and produced for you from your spouses children and grandchildren, and provided you with good provisions. Should they believe in falsehood, and turn unappreciative of GOD's blessings?\r\n                            25:51\r\n                            See, all these are profound. You can take one of these and look, just reflect on the greatness of it and give you proof of God.\r\n                            26:00\r\n                            The spouses, the children, all this is just profound signs.\r\n                            26:14\r\n                            You have to reflect on how the embryos are made, half cells. The reproductive cells are exactly half of the regular number of chromosomes.\r\n                            26:28\r\n                            So, if you take a cell from anywhere, it has 46 chromosomes. But if you look at the reproductive cells, it has 23.\r\n                            26:41\r\n                            Two reproductive cells get together to make a new human being, a new creature, whatever the creature is.\r\n                            26:48\r\n                            I mean, who designed that? Why do the cells are cut in half in the reproductive system and they stay that way?\r\n                            27:01\r\n                            Subhan Allah. Okay, this is our one page. Go back to sleep, John.\r\n                            27:09\r\n                            The messenger: Are you come in earlier like (unintelligible)? A man: He did. Yes.\r\n                            27:28\r\n                            The messenger: 226.\r\n                            27:39\r\n                            أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem\r\n                            27:51\r\n                            [11:38] While Noah was building the ark whenever some of his people passed by him, [just like Bill Cosby said,] they laughed at him. He said, \"You may be laughing at us, but we are laughing at you, just as you are laughing.\r\n                            28:09\r\n                            \"How long can you stay on water? Ha ha ha.\"\r\n                            28:17\r\n                            That was a Quranic tale. 39. [11:39] \"You will soon find out who will suffer a shameful retribution, and incur an everlasting punishment.\"\r\n                            28:27\r\n                            [11:40] When our judgment came, and the atmosphere boiled over, we said, \"Carry on it a pair of each kind, [a male hippo and a female hippo], together with your family, except those who are condemned. Carry with you those who have believed,\" and there were only a few them.\r\n                            28:48\r\n                            ‘Alaykum Al-Salam. [11:41] He said, \"Come on board. In the name of GOD shall be its sailing, and its mooring. My Lord is Forgiver, Most Merciful.\"\r\n                            29:00\r\n                            [11:42] As it sailed with them in waves like hills, Noah called his son, who was isolated: \"O my son, join us; do not be with the disbelievers.\"\r\n                            29:11\r\n                            [11:43] He said, \"I will take refuge on top of a hill, to protect me from the water.\" Noah said, \"Nothing can protect anyone today from GOD's judgment; only those worthy of His mercy (will be saved).\" The waves separated them, and he was among those who drowned.\r\n                            29:29\r\n                            [11:44] It was proclaimed: \"O earth, swallow your water,\" and \"O sky, cease.\" The water then subsided; the judgment was carried out. The ark finally rested on the hills of Judea.* It was then proclaimed: \"The transgressors have perished.\"\r\n                            29:47\r\n                            [11:45] Noah implored his Lord: \"My Lord, my son is a member of my family. Your promise is truthful. And You are the wisest of the wise.\"\r\n                            29:56\r\n                            [11:46] GOD said, \"O Noah, he is not of your family. It is unrighteous to ask Me for something you do not know.* I enlighten you, lest you be ignorant.\"\r\n                            30:10\r\n                            [11:46].... It is unrighteous to ask Me for something you do not know..... It's a significant statement.\r\n                            30:17\r\n                            We shouldn't say things that we do not know. (unintelligible) about God.\r\n                            30:24\r\n                            When God said that (unintelligible) is not infinite physically, we cannot... Satan will push us in that direction.\r\n                            30:34\r\n                            We cannot claim for God what He did not state.\r\n                            30:41\r\n                            We're talking about the issue of \"be and it is\", again. God said to Adam and to Jesus \"be in the world.\"\r\n                            30:50\r\n                            So... yet, when it comes to Adam, God says \"I blew into him from My spirit.\" When He picked Jesus, He sent Adam....Gabriel to Mary.\r\n                            31:01\r\n                            He said \"we blew into her from our spirit.\" But this is \"be\" and \"it is.\"\r\n                            31:23\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible).\r\n                            31:32\r\n                            A man: Be and it is A man: Sent for whom, Mary? God sent angel to Mary The messenger: Gabriel\r\n                            31:45\r\n                            The messenger: This is the story of Noah just like what is happening now in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. God made a decision.\r\n                            31:53\r\n                            Then, (unintelligible). Just like people, even a small company, where board and director sit on the board and he says \"let's do this. Let's do that.\"\r\n                            32:04\r\n                            God runs the world. There's a government running the whole world, the whole universe.\r\n                            32:10\r\n                            God runs every detail in it.\r\n                            32:22\r\n                            47. [11:47] Noah said, \"My Lord, I seek refuge in You, lest I implore You again for something I do not know. Unless You forgive me, and have mercy on me, I will be with the losers.\"\r\n                            32:40\r\n                            [11:48] It was proclaimed: \"O Noah, disembark, with peace and blessings upon you, and upon nations who will descend from your companions. As for the other nations descending from you, we will bless them for awhile, then commit them to painful retribution.\"\r\n                            32:57\r\n                            [11:49] This is news from the past that we reveal to you. You had no knowledge about them—neither you, nor your people—before this. Therefore, be patient. The ultimate victory belongs to the righteous.\r\n                            “This is God’s system” – disbelievers given a chance to see the message.\r\n                            33:10\r\n                            So, what does this mean, \"be patient\"? \"The ultimate victory belongs to the righteous.\"\r\n                            33:16\r\n                            For a nice thing, this is God's system. So, just don't be in a hurry to have the disbelievers wiped out.\r\n                            33:23\r\n                            Be patient. Cause God has given them a chance to receive the message. Look at it. Make a decision.\r\n                            33:31\r\n                            The longer, the longer we are given a chance, the worse the retribution is.\r\n                            33:37\r\n                            But this is God's inevitable system. The disbelievers will have to be wiped out.\r\n                            33:43\r\n                            Hûd Number 50. [11:50] To 'Ãd we sent their brother Hûd. He said, \"O my people, worship GOD; you have no other god besides Him. You are inventing.\r\n                            33:54\r\n                            [11:51] \"O my people, I do not ask you for any wage. My wage comes only from the One who initiated me. Do you not understand?\r\n                            34:03\r\n                            [11:52] \"O my people, seek forgiveness from your Lord, then repent to Him. He will then shower you with provisions from the sky, and augment your strength. Do not turn back like the guilty ones.\"\r\n                            34:17\r\n                            [11:53] They said, \"O Hûd, you did not show us any proof, and we are not abandoning our gods on account of what you say. In you, we are not believers.\"\r\n                            34:32\r\n                            54, [11:54] \"We say that some of our gods have afflicted you with a curse.\" He said, \"I bear witness before GOD, and you bear witness that I disown the idols you have set up—\r\n                            34:44\r\n                            [11:55] \"—besides Him. So, give me your collective response, without delay.\r\n                            34:49\r\n                            [11:56] \"I have put my trust in GOD, my Lord and your Lord. There is not a creature that He does not control. My Lord is on the right path.\r\n                            34:59\r\n                            [11:57] \"If you turn away, then I have delivered to you what I was sent with. My Lord will substitute other people in your place; and you cannot harm Him in the least. My Lord is in control of all things.\"\r\n                            35:13\r\n                            See these two verses. One of them says \"there is not a creature that He does not control.\r\n                            35:19\r\n                            And the Arabic is even stronger than that, much stronger. It says (11:56) مَّا مِن دَآبَّةٍ إِلَّا هُوَ ءَاخِذٌۢ بِنَاصِيَتِهَآ\r\n                            35:27\r\n                            مَّا مِن دَآبَّةٍ Each fly or ant, mosquito, or lion\r\n                            35:34\r\n                            God is fully controlling every single creature on earth. That's why Satan cannot be a god.\r\n                            35:42\r\n                            He couldn't even control (unintelligible).\r\n                            35:50\r\n                            Huge (unintelligible) (unintelligible). on every creature. Every creature is controlled by God.\r\n                            35:57\r\n                            How much the heart pumps, how much blood goes in veins. How big a headache.\r\n                            “Headaches” inflicted by Satan – controlled by God. If a nuclear explosion used to wipe out disbelievers, God will always save the believers somehow.\r\n                            36:03\r\n                            Of course, God doesn't bring the headaches. But even that is decided. God tells Satan \"you can go only this far.\"\r\n                            36:13\r\n                            \"You can't step into Migraine.\" \"Only a little headache.\"\r\n                            36:19\r\n                            Satan has to abide by that. There's not a creature that is not controlled by God.\r\n                            36:25\r\n                            And, 57, 56, 57 says,\r\n                            36:32\r\n                            [11:57].... My Lord is in control of all things.\" So, think of the carpet as a creature.\r\n                            36:39\r\n                            He is in control of every atom. Subhan Allah. 58,\r\n                            36:45\r\n                            [11:58] When our judgment came, we saved Hûd and those who believed with him, by mercy from us. We saved them from a terrible retribution.\r\n                            36:53\r\n                            This, again, is God's system. The believers are saved, whether they are one or one million.\r\n                            36:59\r\n                            God always saves the believers first. And then smashes the disbelievers.\r\n                            37:08\r\n                            So, even if God is punishing disbelievers by a nuclear explosion, somehow the believers will be protected.\r\n                            37:19\r\n                            I think AIDS is a good example because it hits certain people.\r\n                            37:28\r\n                            59, [11:59] Such was 'Ãd—they disregarded the revelations of their Lord, disobeyed His messengers, and followed the ways of every stubborn transgressor.\r\n                            37:38\r\n                            [11:60] Consequently, they incurred condemnation in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, 'Ãd rejected their Lord. Indeed, 'Ãd, the people of Hûd, have perished.\r\n                            37:50\r\n                            Congratulations, you lucky believers. God bless you. Page 228. A man: How long they say Noah's rain was then?\r\n                            38:02\r\n                            The messenger: Probably 24 hours. A man: How long did the...? The messenger: 40 day. A man: 40 days? The messengers: 40 days and 40 nights.\r\n                            38:08\r\n                            The messenger: I don't know what the big deal is. 40 days and 40 nights. They always say, 3 days and 3 nights.\r\n                            38:14\r\n                            40 days and 40 nights.

Healthy sleep.\r\n                            38:31\r\n                            A man: Salãmun ‘Alaykum 212.\r\n                            38:37\r\n                            212.\r\n                            38:46\r\n                            So, how was Palm Desert? A woman: Alhamdu Lillah. It was beautiful. The messenger: Yes, I noticed the weather was good. A woman: Yes.\r\n                            38:54\r\n                            The messenger: IN SHAA ALLAH. 212.\r\n                            39:00\r\n                            Yes, 212.\r\n                            39:13\r\n                            A woman: I am not sure about this.\r\n                            39:26\r\n                            The messenger: أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem Heaven and Hell are Eternal\r\n                            39:31\r\n                            [10:26] As for the righteous, they have deserved a reward, multiplied manifold. Never will they suffer any deprivation or shame. They will be the dwellers of Paradise; they abide therein forever.\r\n                            39:47\r\n                            [10:27] As for those who earned sins, their requital is equivalent to their sin. Humiliation is their lot, and nothing other than GOD can protect them. Their faces will seem like masses of dark night has surrounded them. They will be the dwellers of Hell; they abide therein forever.\r\n                            “Masses of dark night” – eight universe may not be adorned with stars….when believers visit hell, they would bring light with them.\r\n                            40:13\r\n                            Actually, this may not be an allegory, masses of dark night surrounding them.\r\n                            40:20\r\n                            Because I think the most important feature here is darkness.\r\n                            40:25\r\n                            It's going to be far away from... I don't think the 8th universe will be adorned with stars or sun or moon, nothing.\r\n                            40:37\r\n                            It's gonna be darker. When we go visit our relatives and friends, we will provide some light.\r\n                            40:44\r\n                            Idols Disown Their Worshipers 28, [10:28] On the day when we summon them all, we will say to those who worshiped idols, \"We have summoned you, together with your idols.\" We will have them confront each other, and their idols will say to them, \"It was not us that you worshipped.\r\n                            41:07\r\n                            I'm gonna stop here because I put it together with other verses in the Quran. They were worshiping nothing.\r\n                            41:13\r\n                            They go to the tombs of saints and prophets. And they ask them for health and wealth and children and so on.\r\n                            41:21\r\n                            But they are really imploring nothing. There's nothing in them.\r\n                            41:28\r\n                            Whatever is left is the bodies of those saints. It becomes like part of the tomb, part of the earth.\r\n                            41:38\r\n                            So, they're imploring nothing. 29. [10:29] \"GOD suffices as a witness between us and you. We were completely oblivious of your worshiping us.\"\r\n                            41:48\r\n                            Number 30. [10:30] That is when each soul will examine everything it had done. They will be returned to GOD, their rightful Lord and Master, while the idols they had fabricated will disown them.\r\n                            42:01\r\n                            [10:31] Say, \"Who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? Who controls all the hearing and the eyesight? Who produces the living from the dead, and the dead from the living? Who is in control of all things?\" They would say, \"GOD.\" Say, \"Why then do you not observe righteousness?\"\r\n                            42:23\r\n                            First question in 31 is who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? God is the only provider.\r\n                            42:28\r\n                            Of course, most people are not aware of this.\r\n                            42:34\r\n                            Who controls all the hearing and the eyesight? These are nice things that you enjoy.\r\n                            42:42\r\n                            The hearing and the eyesight. God controls them.\r\n                            42:48\r\n                            Last night, Stephanie and I went for our 27th anniversary.\r\n                            42:54\r\n                            Next to us was sitting an old gentleman. Obviously a lady was taking care of him.\r\n                            Old people/parents, loss of hearing or eyesight.\r\n                            43:00\r\n                            And he was with, maybe, a hearing aid. And his helper was yelling at him all the time. That's right.\r\n                            43:11\r\n                            It was very nice. Very nice sentences but in a very loud voice.\r\n                            43:18\r\n                            It's amazing what happened, when we got help. God gave us the eyesight and God gave us...\r\n                            43:25\r\n                            We take these things, we take for granted. We are walking around. You always hear and see. This guy was very old. Obviously, he must have been in his 80s or 90s.\r\n                            43:35\r\n                            And he lost most of his hearing. God controls that.\r\n                            43:42\r\n                            A woman: God is very merciful, too. Because my parents are both... My mom is about 80 and my dad is 85.\r\n                            43:48\r\n                            And my dad has lost a lot of his hearing. And my mom is losing her eyesight.\r\n                            43:54\r\n                            A woman: So, between the two of them they can take care of each other. The messenger: Yeah. Right. The messenger: 80 is when everything goes weak.\r\n                            44:01\r\n                            A woman: .....merciful and wonderful help, Mã Shã Allãh. The messenger: Yes. The messenger: Good parents are assisted.\r\n                            44:08\r\n                            And also parents here in (unintelligible). A woman: My mom and my dad (unintelligible).\r\n                            44:17\r\n                            (unintelligible). The messenger: Yeah, but (unintelligible) a picnic. That's why (unintelligible).\r\n                            44:23\r\n                            A woman: Yeah, because she saw me from (unintelligible). Alhamdu Lillah. The messenger: Right.\r\n                            44:29\r\n                            That's why God gave us two eyes.\r\n                            44:35\r\n                            And they are in their 80s. So, your father is 80 and your mother almost 80.\r\n                            44:44\r\n                            And they're not even believers. I mean, not the way we are. They don't know about the Quran, you know.\r\n                            44:49\r\n                            They don't know the details of the miracle of 19. Probably because of you that they are in much better shape than most people.\r\n                            45:02\r\n                            Just for your sake, God will make them good. A woman: (unintelligible).\r\n                            45:10\r\n                            The messenger: Yeah, (unintelligible). See, four cats, right? Double, two cats at least.\r\n                            45:16\r\n                            You've seen double. Or after the operation. A woman: Well, afterwards... The messenger: You've seen four or two after the operation? A woman: Depends on what I look at.\r\n                            45:27\r\n                            The messenger: Before the operation? A woman: Sometimes I was before the operation to be honest. This side was going to the side.\r\n                            45:34\r\n                            The messenger: So, you were seeing Mahmoud when you were looking at me?\r\n                            45:40\r\n                            A woman: No, but you knew what she was looking at.\r\n                            45:50\r\n                            The messenger: That was funny. We had a professor... In fact, he is the same professor who (unintelligible).\r\n                            46:03\r\n                            And his eyes were going like this, so you can't tell who he is looking at. And we took advantage of this.\r\n                            46:08\r\n                            Because when we used to... For oral examination, he'd have two people. Okay?\r\n                            46:14\r\n                            He's asking us oral questions.

We made agreement, whoever knows the question, answer it.\r\n                            46:25\r\n                            Because he didn't know...\r\n                            46:33\r\n                            We made an agreement with ourselves. When he asks a question, whoever knows the question, answer it.\r\n                            46:40\r\n                            And we'll just say that you were looking at him?\r\n                            46:45\r\n                            \"I was asking you.\" \"But you were looking at him.\" \"Oh, okay.\" The messenger: Poor guy. I think we probably gave him a complex.\r\n                            46:52\r\n                            A woman: It wasn't always obvious when he looked. What I am saying is it was getting worse. And it was putting a lot strain on... and I couldn't... I liked to read, but I had trouble reading.\r\n                            47:02\r\n                            A man: And then two people said and answer the same thing. The messenger: That was my next statement.\r\n                            47:09\r\n                            The messenger: Then, there comes a situation where he asks a question none of us will know. And the two of us will just sit there and not answer.\r\n                            47:14\r\n                            \"I'm asking you.\" \"Oh, you're talking to me?\" We'll create a scene until he forgets the question.\r\n                            47:29\r\n                            That's the true story.

So, it gets digested.\r\n                            48:09\r\n                            So, it is dead for all practical purposes. But if you leave it alone, you can have a chicken come out of the egg.\r\n                            48:18\r\n                            That's the living from the dead. And the dead from the living is because after a while, you eat the chicken.\r\n                            48:24\r\n                            The chicken is dead. The messenger: Go ahead.

They cannot believe.\r\n                            50:01\r\n                            Otherwise if they decide (unintelligible) to God, God blocks them out.

But genetic engineering, they actually go in the cell and add chromosomes and things. A man: Yeah.\r\n                            53:00\r\n                            The messenger: But still, they're using God's material. And then, they make the cell.

That could be a big gene.\r\n                            53:41\r\n                            Actually, your nose is very good looking.

And he lived long enough, they took parts of his cells and they separated them out and they did all this matching with The messenger: to find out...\r\n                            54:19\r\n                            A woman: normal cells to find out what gene it was that was missing. A woman: And that's why they think that he had changed, muscular dystrophy was one of them.\r\n                            54:26\r\n                            A woman: And they think they've isolated the gene that causes that so that they can now do genetic tests on a fetus and find out if it's predisposed to that.\r\n                            54:35\r\n                            And it was just so beautiful because the article said \"he lived long enough for this.\" And I thought that was his purpose.\r\n                            54:41\r\n                            The messenger: Exactly. A woman: You know, that's why he was here. A woman: He was to give them this information. And then he's gone to Heaven.\r\n                            54:47\r\n                            He died at like 17, so Mã Shã Allãh. A woman: He's gone to heaven. The messenger: Mã Shã Allãh. A woman: And some advances have probably been made.

We're creatures walking on earth because of these.\r\n                            55:02\r\n                            They're very tiny. There are things that are all sub-microscopic.

A man: So, someone is telling all the master gene is controlling them and giving them instructions.\r\n                            55:38\r\n                            The messenger: That's a whole different issue. A man: Yes, really. It's amazing. The messenger: Yes. The messenger: This is after deciding the characteristics of the human being in the genes.\r\n                            55:46\r\n                            These are in the reproductive cell of the man or the woman.

It is. It's called a genetic code. That's why they have a whole course that they put in Grad school.\r\n                            56:12\r\n                            A man: Is it the same as DNA?

Deoxyribonucleic acid.\r\n                            56:26\r\n                            This is my famous joke, another famous joke. You've probably heard a hundred times.\r\n                            56:32\r\n                            It's about the two schools of thought in teaching because there's so much knowledge around,\r\n                            56:37\r\n                            Some people say \"it starts from the basics and goes gradually to the complex issues.\" And some people say \"let's teach the complex issues and students will grab the basics as they go.\"\r\n                            56:47\r\n                            They are two valid schools of thought, actually. So, Watson, who discovered the DNA, the helical structure, he got a Nobel Prize. He was sitting in the plane one time. This is a true story.\r\n                            57:01\r\n                            Well, modified. I'm making a joke. He was sitting next to a guy, and this guy was studying DNA and here's the man who discovered DNA's structure and everything about DNA, the most expert in the whole world about DNA.\r\n                            57:15\r\n                            And this student happened to be one of the people who followed the second, who grew up in the second school of thought that teaches the complex and forget the basics. \"They'll catch it up.\"\r\n                            57:26\r\n                            So, Watson volunteered. He couldn't resist. He said \"well, if you... I know something about this if you need any help or anything.\"\r\n                            57:33\r\n                            He said \"well, I know everything about deoxyribonucleic but what is acid?\"\r\n                            57:42\r\n                            Congratulations.\r\n                            57:47\r\n                            The messenger: It's a very basic thing. A woman: (Unintelligible) then said \"the only word in there that I know...\"\r\n                            57:53\r\n                            The messenger: Oh, you followed another school of thought. A woman: Yes, yes I saw the basics and never got any farther.\r\n                            58:00\r\n                            The messenger: Ok. Mã Shã Allãh The messenger: Okay, workers.\r\n                            \r\n                            12 Quran Study From Behrouz 212 Behrouz's Khutba Edip. Yuksel's Exposure 01 25 1990\r\n                            \r\n                            Behrouz: Alhamdu Lillah, Wa Ash-hadu Alla Elaha Ella Allah Wahdahu La Shareeka Lah.\r\n                            0:11\r\n                            Behrouz: The reason for this Khutba is because we had a visitor from San Francisco. And\r\n                            0:17\r\n                            she came by to check us out and unfortunately she got shocked because of the way we were treating the God's messenger.\r\n                            0:26\r\n                            According from Quran, the verse is 6:8 says\r\n                            0:33\r\n                            [6:8] They also said, \"If only an angel could come down with him!\" Had we sent an angel, the whole matter would have been terminated, and they would not have been respited.\r\n                            0:47\r\n                            6 Chapter 6, verse 9 says, [6:9] Had we sent an angel, we would have sent him in the form of a man, and we would have kept them confused.\r\n                            1:00\r\n                            43:53 and 6:50 say the same thing, [6:50] Say, \"I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of GOD. Nor do I know the future. Nor do I say to you that I am an angel. I simply follow what is revealed to me.\" Say, \"Is the blind the same as the seer? Do you not think?\"\r\n                            1:24\r\n                            6:158 says, [6:158] Are they waiting for the angels to come to them, or your Lord, or some manifestations of your Lord? The day this happens, no soul will benefit from believing if it did not believe before that. So, \"Keep on waiting; we too will wait.\"\r\n                            1:49\r\n                            [2:210] Are they waiting until GOD comes down to them in dense clouds, with the angels? The whole matter will then be terminated, and to GOD everything will be returned.*\r\n                            2:09\r\n                            They are waiting for the angels, 16:33, [16:33] They are waiting for the angels to come to them, or until your Lord's judgment comes to pass. Those before them did the same thing. GOD is not the One who wronged them; they are the ones who wronged themselves.\r\n                            2:27\r\n                            11:12 [11:12] You may tend to disregard some of that which is revealed to you, and you may be annoyed by it. When they may say, \"How come no treasure comes down to him, or an angel?\" You are only a warner; GOD controls all things.\r\n                            2:51\r\n                            15:7 says, [15:7] \"Why do you not bring down the angels, if you are truthful?\"\r\n                            2:57\r\n                            15:8 says, [15:8] We do not send down the angels except for specific purpose. Otherwise, no one will be respited.\r\n                            3:05\r\n                            17:92 says, [17:92] \"Or unless we cause masses from the sky to fall on us, as you claimed. Or unless you bring GOD and the angels before our eyes.\r\n                            3:17\r\n                            17:95 says, [17:95] \"If the earth were inhabited by angels, we could have sent down to them from the sky an angel messenger.\"\r\n                            3:27\r\n                            [25:22] The day they see the angels, it will not be good news for the guilty; they will say, \"We are irreversibly confused.\"\r\n                            3:38\r\n                            [43:60] If we willed, we could have made you angels colonizing the earth.\r\n                            3:48\r\n                            Behrouz: I wish to God that among us there would be anyone that would not believe in God's messenger\r\n                            3:53\r\n                            because God's messenger, Alhamdu Lillah, is alive and well among us and we just have to obey.\r\n                            4:05\r\n                            And constantly he goes around repeating \"you have to believe in God and obey His messenger.\"\r\n                            4:11\r\n                            Right after \"God\" comes the word of messenger. You have to follow the messenger.\r\n                            4:16\r\n                            Excuse me. Obey the messenger.\r\n                            4:24\r\n                            Now, a couple of weeks ago, our brother Mohtasham talked about the responsibility, but today,\r\n                            4:31\r\n                            God willing, I'm gonna specify our responsibilities, which is God's will that's the time we are in this world now.\r\n                            4:39\r\n                            And believe me, anything happens in this Masjid, I have seen it with my own eyes.\r\n                            4:45\r\n                            Just last week, in computer room, Dr. Khalifa was writing the new perspective,\r\n                            4:51\r\n                            and there was a word, it would not go to the computer. That was not God's will.\r\n                            4:57\r\n                            Behrouz: It took some time, either it was shorter or a long. That it took some times til it eventually went into computer, That was God's will, Alhamdu Lillah.\r\n                            5:04\r\n                            So, anything happening over here, Alhamdu Lillah, it's just like God is looking at us, all of us, right in here, and it's a very, very crucial moment.\r\n                            5:16\r\n                            Now, so we have to obey this responsibility.\r\n                            5:22\r\n                            Now, God is telling us how to fulfill this responsibility about our messenger.\r\n                            5:29\r\n                            We shall not argue with the messenger. There is no way whatsoever we can argue with the messenger.\r\n                            5:35\r\n                            That's arguing with the word of God, with God's messenger. And when a verse says that after, if you die before age of 40, you go to Heaven, that's it.\r\n                            5:49\r\n                            We cannot ask him why. If you have any problem, you can ask God, because his job is to just deliver the message.\r\n                            5:58\r\n                            6:33 says, [6:33] We know that you may sadden by what they say. You should know that it is not you that they reject; it is GOD's revelations that the wicked disregard.\r\n                            6:14\r\n                            Unfortunately, last week, that is fortunate actually, Dr. Shakira came from San Francisco,\r\n                            6:22\r\n                            and she was, she is a beautiful, Mã Shã Allãh, a very, very strong believer.\r\n                            6:28\r\n                            If she was not, she would have left the message, Masjid because she actually said it herself that\r\n                            6:35\r\n                            \"I am confused\", the way we are treating the messenger.\r\n                            6:41\r\n                            We cannot have any opinion or any suggestions. It's just the word of God.\r\n                            6:48\r\n                            And if you all remember the story of Moses and his teacher, he kept interrupting him,\r\n                            6:55\r\n                            \"Why did you kill that? Why did you make a hole in the ship?\" We are not supposed to ask these questions.\r\n                            7:02\r\n                            When the right time comes, we will find out ourselves, IN SHAA ALLAH. 491 says, O you who\r\n                            7:08\r\n                            49:1 says, [49:1] O you who believe, do not place your opinion above that of GOD and His messenger. You shall reverence GOD. GOD is Hearer, Omniscient.\r\n                            7:20\r\n                            The reason is because we might help the messenger. 9:61 says [9:61] ..... He is a mercy for those among you who believe.\" Those who hurt GOD's messenger have incurred a painful retribution.\r\n                            7:38\r\n                            33:57 says, [33:57] Surely, those who oppose GOD and His messenger, GOD condemns them in this life, and in the Hereafter; ....\r\n                            7:49\r\n                            [33:69] O you who believe, do not be like those who hurt Moses, then GOD absolved him of what they said. He was, in the sight of GOD, honorable.\r\n                            8:04\r\n                            61:5 says, [61:5] Recall that Moses said to his people, \"O my people, why do you hurt me, even though you know that I am GOD's messenger?\" When they deviated, GOD diverted their hearts. For GOD does not guide the wicked people.\r\n                            8:25\r\n                            [49:2] O you who believe, do not raise your voices above the voice of the prophet,* nor shall you shout at him as you shout at each other, lest your works become nullified while you do not perceive.\r\n                            8:45\r\n                            [49:3] Surely, those who lower.... This is 49:3, [49:3] ...... who lower their voices at the messenger of GOD are the ones whose hearts are prepared by GOD to become righteous.* They deserve forgiveness and a great recompense.\r\n                            9:06\r\n                            [49:4] As for those who call on you from outside the walls, most of them do not understand.\r\n                            9:16\r\n                            We cannot call \"Dr. Khalifa, come over here. We wanna go, let's do the prayer.\"\r\n                            9:23\r\n                            We cannot do that. This is, it doesn't bother him personally, but this is, it's going to nullify our work, whatever we have done.\r\n                            9:36\r\n                            God says on 49:5 [49:5] Had they been patient until you came out to them, it would have been better for them. GOD is Forgiver, Most Merciful.\r\n                            9:48\r\n                            As for any communities, this community, we have to have discipline.\r\n                            9:54\r\n                            Discipline according to the God's law that we have to follow.\r\n                            10:00\r\n                            Now, I'm just gonna give you an example, that is an outside example.\r\n                            10:07\r\n                            It's probably the human and devil kingdom, but you cannot and you will not call President Bush by his first name.\r\n                            10:19\r\n                            Have you seen anyone call him by his first name? If he was here right now with us, we would wear all suit and tie,\r\n                            10:26\r\n                            he had millions of bodyguards, and you would be sitting just like that. Now, but messenger is a position that God has given, and this is the highest point position in this world.\r\n                            10:42\r\n                            And we have to follow God's word. God called him messenger.\r\n                            10:48\r\n                            For the newcomers, they come outside, they see us, we have Friday classes.\r\n                            10:57\r\n                            When they leave, they don't know who was the messenger, who was the student, who was the teacher. Everybody is laying down, some people are sleeping.\r\n                            11:05\r\n                            Please, we have to cut this off, because this is against God's law, against God's rules.\r\n                            11:12\r\n                            Please, over here, this side of this door, be very formal.\r\n                            11:19\r\n                            When you go outside, when you go inside to RASOOL ALLAH, just call him Rashad, or whatever you want as a friend.\r\n                            11:27\r\n                            But when we are here, on this side of the door, please let us be example for the newcomers.\r\n                            11:34\r\n                            We don't want someone, as a reporter, come over here, calling RASOOL ALLAH, and then call him, Rashad.\r\n                            11:39\r\n                            Don't you feel funny when there is someone coming from outside, they tell us what to tell him?\r\n                            11:45\r\n                            But God already called him RASOOL ALLAH. God positioned him as a RASOOL ALLAH.\r\n                            11:50\r\n                            So, we have to, I mean, this is up to everybody, whatever they want, we think about it, but\r\n                            11:57\r\n                            this is God's rule. This is God's law. This is the rule we should have among us.\r\n                            12:03\r\n                            This is a very, very crucial moment that we have to take heed, and understand it.\r\n                            12:08\r\n                            We are so busy with the miracle of 19, we forgot the small things over here.\r\n                            12:14\r\n                            And one is, please, you can call him RASOOL ALLAH, Mr. Khalifa, Dr. Khalifa.\r\n                            12:20\r\n                            Please, when you are having a study group, don't call by the first name.\r\n                            12:25\r\n                            First name is me, or you, or others, but he is RASOOL ALLAH.\r\n                            12:35\r\n                            God is teaching us everything, even the manners, how to treat each other, and RASOOL ALLAH, His messenger.\r\n                            12:48\r\n                            Last conference, that was my first conference, I didn't know many people, I only knew Dr. Khalifa, and Susan, Lisa, and a few other people, because of my last visit for a couple of days.\r\n                            13:00\r\n                            At the time of conference, I was sitting on the right hand side, facing the microphone,\r\n                            13:06\r\n                            I was leaning to the bookshelf, and I was watching the whole group, there was a gentleman among us.\r\n                            13:17\r\n                            He would not leave the meeting. He would not come in unless Dr. Khalifa turned to him, or accidentally see him, he said \"can I go?\"\r\n                            13:25\r\n                            And he would go. And that gentleman was Sammy. That is his son.\r\n                            13:31\r\n                            And we all, I just have to thank you, this is the thing that every one of us, we have to know this, to learn it.\r\n                            13:38\r\n                            We have to learn this system. This is my, and all of you, I'm sure, is the first messenger.\r\n                            13:46\r\n                            We do not know how to treat. And last time, I probably said something wrong, and I called Dr. Khalifa, I said \"I'm very\r\n                            13:56\r\n                            sorry, you are my first messenger, and I have no experience about it, just forgive me, please.\"\r\n                            14:01\r\n                            And so as for all of us, it's no problem, we just don't know, but that doesn't mean that\r\n                            14:08\r\n                            we just have to keep following whatever we have been doing.\r\n                            14:14\r\n                            Now, God says on 24:62, [24:62] The true believers are those who believe in GOD and His messenger,* and when they are with him in a community meeting, they do not leave him without permission.\r\n                            14:31\r\n                            Again, God says exactly the same thing, [24:62].... Those who ask your permission are the ones who do believe in GOD and His messenger.\r\n                            14:44\r\n                            He put the God and His messenger first sentence, and then get the permission, and then the second sentence,\r\n                            14:50\r\n                            He said \"these are the ones, they believe in God and His messenger.\" I mean, this is very, very crucial and important.\r\n                            14:56\r\n                            And just from this verse, we get millions of things about how to treat the messenger.\r\n                            15:04\r\n                            It's just completely different with anyone else on this earth.\r\n                            15:15\r\n                            My brother, Mahmoud JAN, just mentioned to me, verse 7, Sura 7:31.\r\n                            15:31\r\n                            God says, [7:31] O children of Adam, you shall be clean and dress nicely when you go to the mosque. You shall eat and drink moderately. God does not love the excess\r\n                            15:47\r\n                            Now, please again, brothers, sisters, just, I love you, that's why I'm talking about this.\r\n                            15:54\r\n                            If there was someone outside, I would not. I would tell my children, I would tell my mom, because I care about them.\r\n                            16:02\r\n                            And please, when you come in, freedom, it's a beautiful word.\r\n                            16:11\r\n                            But when you are in a group, when you are in a society, when you are in this community,\r\n                            16:17\r\n                            it's completely freedom. But having respect is different. So please, I wanna ask you, I love you, especially the ones, I know they have the same feeling about me too, but this is the word of God. Please do not lay down.\r\n                            16:32\r\n                            We have the, I know for some of us, it's very uncomfortable to sit down. But believe me, it's very uncomfortable in the hell too.\r\n                            16:40\r\n                            It's only two hours. And if you are sleeping, please sleep at home. And come later. It's not bad.\r\n                            16:49\r\n                            I'm sorry. Please don't get mad at me, because we all, we don't notice.\r\n                            16:58\r\n                            We just do not notice these things. We think, if you go to a class, do you lay down and make a position like you are in Hollywood and take a movie?\r\n                            17:10\r\n                            If you just sit down properly, the teacher is over there, we have to follow him. Believe me, back home, we could never ever put our feet on the top of the table.\r\n                            17:21\r\n                            Every time we put it down. So, these are the rules. Please, this is, we learn it from each other, from the society, from God, especially forgive me, God, that we have to follow for, especially for our messenger.\r\n                            17:42\r\n                            And also something else I wanna give as the parents.\r\n                            17:47\r\n                            Believe me, if you are in that room, if one child runs from here to there, it's like an airport over there.\r\n                            17:54\r\n                            Believe me. I was there two days ago, in the afternoon, there was no one in the office, I was taking care of\r\n                            18:00\r\n                            Ahmad's children, beautiful, but they just went to get the pillow, bring it back over here and sleep. And they slept.\r\n                            18:06\r\n                            I couldn't believe it. But as soon as they run over there, it's... I don't know what happened, the reaction over there, it's just like an airport.\r\n                            18:16\r\n                            Now, Friday nights, RASOOL ALLAH, Susan, Lisa, Emily, they are here, they work 19, 20 hours a day.\r\n                            18:27\r\n                            They need the rest. Now, after this last meeting, everybody, all the kids, they get up, they bring the pillows, they have fun over here. Please take care of them.\r\n                            18:37\r\n                            Please let them... have them, quiet them down.\r\n                            18:48\r\n                            Now we repent.\r\n                            19:01\r\n                            Alhamdu Lillah, Ash-hadu Alla Elaha Ella Allah Wahdahu La Shareeka Lah.\r\n                            19:07\r\n                            Last time, I forgot on my notes that today I have everything from (unintelligible).\r\n                            19:13\r\n                            The other point, the subject that I wanna talk about is, it's about ego, the ego as a god.\r\n                            19:19\r\n                            [45:23] Have you noted the one whose god is his ego? Consequently, GOD sends him astray, knowingly and seals his hearing and his mind, and places a veil on his eyes. Who then can guide him, after such a decision by GOD? Would you not take heed?\r\n                            19:42\r\n                            Please, this is a very very sensitive point, very sensitive action that most of the time,\r\n                            19:51\r\n                            without knowing it, we just pass through it, then later on we find out about it, then we're gonna be sorry about it.\r\n                            20:01\r\n                            The other point is, out there, there is a word, they call it intelligent, smart, entrepreneur, so and so, genius, whatever.\r\n                            20:12\r\n                            This is not this place's word. This is not God's word. Behrouz: The only intelligent to God is repeated in 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,17...16,17. The messenger: 16, 17.\r\n                            20:33\r\n                            Behrouz: About 18 verses that I could have find that God calls intelligent only to the one they believe in God and follow God's system.\r\n                            20:43\r\n                            That's it. God doesn't... He doesn't care if you are in real estate, you make billions of dollars, good for you, if you are genius, good for your parents, that's fine.\r\n                            20:53\r\n                            But when you come to this masjid, please, as you take off your shoes, please take off you ego,\r\n                            21:00\r\n                            take off your genius, hang it on a tree and come in. I am just telling you as a friend, because I try my best to do it, and believe me, every night when I go home,\r\n                            21:10\r\n                            I repent and I ask God, if I did something wrong today, please forgive me.\r\n                            21:15\r\n                            I ask God for four months to be in here in this masjid, to be close to His messenger.\r\n                            21:21\r\n                            And Alhamdu Lillah, He granted it. But now I'm just going by the rule that please God, if I make something, some mistake, please let me know.\r\n                            21:30\r\n                            So, if someone tells you this and that, this is because we are brothers, we are sisters,\r\n                            21:36\r\n                            and I really appreciate the ladies, we, men, have to learn from them, please become a gentleman.\r\n                            21:44\r\n                            Because I haven't seen any ladies to lay down. I just love them.\r\n                            21:50\r\n                            Aqem Al-Salat.

Dr. Sabahi: Rashad, I have to make some comments before what he said, on this Khutba before I go.\r\n                            23:54\r\n                            The messenger: Okay, go ahead. Dr. Sabahi: Just, listen please. No, Quranic study is not the place because other people come in.\r\n                            24:03\r\n                            What this Khutba reminded me was the Islam that I have been giving away all my life.\r\n                            24:13\r\n                            This reminded me of my teacher in my grade school who told me to shut up.\r\n                            24:18\r\n                            \"Put your intelligence outside and come in and listen to what I tell you and what God is telling you.\"\r\n                            24:24\r\n                            We are intelligent people.

If you wanna make changes, don't push it.\r\n                            24:36\r\n                            Don't ask us to change everything overnight and go to a system that is all the religious establishment outside is like that.\r\n                            24:44\r\n                            You go to any religious establishment, you can't see the guy, whoever it is. You have to go through steps to see the person.\r\n                            24:51\r\n                            You wanna create that, we have it outside, we don't have to come here. I don't agree with 99% of what he said personally and I would love to hear Rashad.\r\n                            25:02\r\n                            I usually call him Dr. Khalifa to come out and say whether he really believes that this is the system he wants.\r\n                            25:14\r\n                            I don't object to Quran. I can sit down and read Quran and follow it and see whether I am doing something wrong.\r\n                            25:22\r\n                            But if I come here and I see Khalifa, Dr. Khalifa is available for me, this is something\r\n                            25:28\r\n                            that people see different from others. I'm not saying that I can insult him. Have you seen me treating him or calling him?\r\n                            25:34\r\n                            But other things that you put your intelligence outside and come in. That is asking me to be a follower, eyes closed, ear closed and just follow.\r\n                            25:45\r\n                            Behrouz: No, God describes intelligence different. Dr. Sabahi: This is not right. Ego, yes. Dr. Sabahi: I say ego, yes.\r\n                            25:51\r\n                            But intelligence, this is what God gave to me and to everyone to do that.\r\n                            25:57\r\n                            The messenger: We'll discuss it tonight and there's very good reason for saying what he said and like Susan said \"he only read Quran.\"\r\n                            Clashes about how to refer to Dr. Rashad Khalifa. Explains purpose of Sura 2. Correcting our rebellion.\r\n                            26:04\r\n                            So, together we're gonna read this and our choices to follow what God is saying. Dr. Sabahi: I would love to hear what you have to say about this.\r\n                            26:09\r\n                            If you wanna put it in Quranic study to discuss, that would be great. The messenger: I'll discuss it for about 10 minutes. Behrouz: I'm not breaking the rules. I just read it from the Quran.\r\n                            26:17\r\n                            Edip: Nowhere in the Quran doesn't say don't call with name. We call Muhammad with his name. We call Moses with his name.\r\n                            26:24\r\n                            The messenger: No, it's not true. It's not true. (24:63) لَّا تَجْعَلُوا۟ دُعَآءَ ٱلرَّسُولِ بَيْنَكُمْ كَدُعَآءِ بَعْضِكُم The messenger: It's in the Quran.\r\n                            26:30\r\n                            Edip: But we shouldn't say that Muhammad only by itself. We shouldn't say Moses by itself. Edip: We shouldn't make distinction between messengers. The messenger: They're not here. They're not here.\r\n                            26:37\r\n                            The messenger: I will discuss it... I will discuss it tonight. But you can leave your ego outside or stay with it.\r\n                            26:45\r\n                            If you have any ego, don't come in here. Stay with it outside. Edip: I want to discuss the subject because.... The messenger: Tonight, we'll discuss it, Edip\r\n                            26:53\r\n                            The messenger: Humans insisted on it. So, the human being generally is just a hard core criminal.\r\n                            27:02\r\n                            And we have to know that...\r\n                            27:09\r\n                            ....in order. to solve our problems. Obviously, we have a problem that caused our dismissal from God's kingdom,\r\n                            27:20\r\n                            not once or twice, but a few times.\r\n                            27:26\r\n                            And then God gives us lessons in the Quran to teach us that we are rebels.\r\n                            27:36\r\n                            Otherwise, why does God put in the Quran those lessons, those examples from life?\r\n                            27:45\r\n                            The biggest Sura in the Quran, the longest Sura, is entitled the Heifer.\r\n                            27:53\r\n                            Even though it's a Sura that is full of, all the five so-called pillars of Islam are in Sura number two.\r\n                            28:04\r\n                            The order to pray, the orders to fast Ramadan, the orders to give Zakat, the orders to make pilgrimage,\r\n                            28:19\r\n                            the rules of marriage, divorce, war, they're all in Sura number two.\r\n                            28:24\r\n                            But the title indicates the importance of the subject that is within every Sura.\r\n                            28:33\r\n                            And God chose the title \"the Heifer.\" So, what is the Heifer?\r\n                            28:39\r\n                            The Heifer symbolizes the people who are with the messenger, but they are rebels.\r\n                            28:50\r\n                            And they give the messenger a hell of a time. This is what the Heifer is all about.\r\n                            28:57\r\n                            So, if we are fortunate, we will learn from this. And we will catch our rebellious nature and correct it in order to be redeemed back to God's kingdom, to get rid of the rebellion, and to correct it.\r\n                            29:18\r\n                            Moses told his people \"God orders you to sacrifice a Heifer.\r\n                            29:27\r\n                            So, what did they do?\r\n                            29:34\r\n                            They said \"are you kidding?\" He said \"I seek refuge in God, lest I be that ignorant.\"\r\n                            29:48\r\n                            And you know the rest of the story. I'm not gonna tell you the story of the Heifer again. But why is God putting it there? Why God is putting so much importance on it?\r\n                            29:58\r\n                            And giving the name of the title of the Sura from that incident, why?\r\n                            30:04\r\n                            It's for us to learn. The same story happened this afternoon.\r\n                            30:11\r\n                            Very similar story. And the fortunate ones are the ones who learn from their God-given lessons.\r\n                            30:28\r\n                            I mean, we love each other very much, and we know that we are in the purification process.\r\n                            30:36\r\n                            We're being purified. I love Hamid very much. I don't know if he's here or not.\r\n                            30:42\r\n                            But today, after a discussion with some people about the way he was dressed.\r\n                            30:51\r\n                            He was dressed in a short and a sweatshirt.\r\n                            30:58\r\n                            And then they asked me \"what does God say about dressing for the mosque, for the masjid?\"\r\n                            Dress code for the Masjid.\r\n                            31:05\r\n                            I said \"there are two things in the Quran, one of them says \"dress up for the mosque.\"\r\n                            31:12\r\n                            And one says \"dress modestly.\"\r\n                            31:18\r\n                            Okay, so God says \"sacrifice a Heifer.\"\r\n                            31:24\r\n                            God says \"dress up for the mosque.\" So, what did he say? He said \"how do you dress up for the mosque?\"\r\n                            31:34\r\n                            It's the same answer that was given to Moses, right? We are human beings. Those who are human beings. And these are human beings.\r\n                            31:44\r\n                            You know, we're applying for a job in God's kingdom.\r\n                            31:50\r\n                            This is why we're trying to go back, and we a. e applying for a job.\r\n                            31:55\r\n                            So, if you have an interview for a job, how will you dress?\r\n                            32:02\r\n                            Will you go in a short and slippers? Of course, we don't wanna be that formal, but I mean, we have to be reasonable.\r\n                            32:15\r\n                            So, I have to explain how you dress up for the mosque.\r\n                            32:24\r\n                            God says, (7:31) يَـٰبَنِىٓ ءَادَمَ خُذُوا۟ زِينَتَكُمْ عِندَ كُلِّ مَسْجِدٍۢ He says \"O children of Adam,...\" \"dress up\" is a good translation for that.\r\n                            32:36\r\n                            \"Every time you go to the mosque.\" Why?\r\n                            32:42\r\n                            Why is God telling us to dress up every time we go to the mosque?\r\n                            32:52\r\n                            I mean, is God, is He finicky or what? I mean, Astaghfirullah.\r\n                            33:02\r\n                            Why is He telling us to dress up for the mosque? How would you like to go to the mosque and find that everybody looks terrible and stinks?\r\n                            33:13\r\n                            How will, what will happen? I mean, this is what....\r\n                            33:21\r\n                            What we're doing, we're not following God's commands.\r\n                            33:29\r\n                            So, we have to learn from our lessons that God has given us.\r\n                            33:37\r\n                            There are reasons for calling it the Heifer and emphasizing this story.\r\n                            33:42\r\n                            And over and over and over throughout the Quran, we see the children of Israel, the story of the children of Israel. Believe me, it's happening. Everything they did.\r\n                            33:52\r\n                            This is why God put the children of Israel in the Quran. Because we are doing the same things. And these are God's chosen people.\r\n                            34:03\r\n                            What color is she? These are God's chosen people. We are not talking about the rebels of the rebels.\r\n                            34:11\r\n                            We're talking about the chosen ones among the rebels.\r\n                            34:18\r\n                            So, with this introduction, I'm going to have, see how we, all of us collectively feel about this.\r\n                            34:27\r\n                            Laurie. Laurie: I think I can see that a word that to me is very important. (unintelligible)\r\n                            34:34\r\n                            Men have to be modest, too. We're here at Quranic sitting, we're at Juma'. And it's really hard when people are speaking,\r\n                            34:40\r\n                            and you look around and all you see is legs. You know, just bare legs.\r\n                            34:46\r\n                            So, you turn away, over here is another pair of bare legs. And you look over here and there's another pair of bare legs.\r\n                            34:52\r\n                            And the shorts are short and it's like... You know, women have the same feelings as men.\r\n                            34:57\r\n                            And, you know, if we all came in shorts, nobody would be able to concentrate on anything. And this is such a similar time.\r\n                            35:03\r\n                            So, I'm just so glad to hear it finally brought up that modesty in men is just as important, you know, as it is for women.\r\n                            35:12\r\n                            Laurie: And it's been, you know, very distracting. And sometimes it's really hard to concentrate because you can't see them. All you see is somewhere is legs.\r\n                            35:20\r\n                            The messenger: And God addressed both the men and the women to subdue their eyes, both of them. So, God wants us to help each other in this way.\r\n                            35:30\r\n                            Linda.\r\n                            35:43\r\n                            Speak louder. Linda: Are you saying.... The messenger: I think the same thing that Laurie is saying. Oh.\r\n                            35:51\r\n                            Right. They can be distracted as well. Linda: ....., Rashad. I really, really think, I think the first responsibility lies with each one of us, with our eyes.\r\n                            36:06\r\n                            (unintelligible) any kind of distraction. The messenger: Right. Linda: And that, I mean, the fact that we see that right, we need (unintelligible) in order to help each other. We need not to present situations. Especially, The messenger: Right.\r\n                            36:20\r\n                            Linda: within our community, it will hinder each other because we are brothers and sisters. We need to recognize our weaknesses and help each other not to be in situations where the devil can bring our weaknesses out.\r\n                            36:33\r\n                            The messenger: Um-hum. Mã Shã Allãh Edip: Rashad, (unintelligible) the reason I want to (unintelligible) is because... The messenger: Yeah, go ahead.\r\n                            36:44\r\n                            Edip: I (unintelligible)... that some people know and some people doesn't know (unintelligible) and some people The messenger: That's right.\r\n                            36:53\r\n                            Edip: I know they are (unintelligible) and they are brightened and\r\n                            36:59\r\n                            just really very disturbing. Edip: I just want to share with you this few pages. First of all, honestly I am a sincere believer. I know myself. I will say it. It's not ego.\r\n                            Edip Yuksel complains and accuses Dr. Rashad Khalifa of flaws.\r\n                            37:16\r\n                            You know, if you are sincere, people around me can judge that we are sincere.\r\n                            37:21\r\n                            In Turkey, when I heard this message, thank God, from Rashad, God put me in the greatest.\r\n                            37:29\r\n                            I gave up everything that I had until that time. I gave up from my thousands of readers.\r\n                            37:37\r\n                            I gave up from my job. I gave up from my family, from my father, mother, sisters, each friend.\r\n                            37:46\r\n                            And I accepted when I first heard that Rashad says \"I'm a messenger of God\", I accepted without any doubt. I said \"yes, okay.\"\r\n                            37:56\r\n                            I had no ego in this case. And now some people just want to accuse me that I have great ego and I am idol worship.\r\n                            38:06\r\n                            I worship my ego. It is very easy accusation. Oh, somebody who takes questions or discuss a subject if he doesn't understand.\r\n                            38:15\r\n                            \"Oh, you are egoistic. You are worshiping your ego.\" It is very easy. Edip: And for some people, they want to show that they are protector of the messenger. From whom? From believer.\r\n                            38:26\r\n                            And backbite a believer and accuse a believer. At that time, show yourself,\r\n                            38:32\r\n                            you are protector of the messenger. You love messenger more than everybody. What kind of race is this?\r\n                            38:38\r\n                            Is that righteous race? I want to share some verses from Quran. Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ\r\n                            38:46\r\n                            [2:269] ..... Only those who possess intelligence will take heed. God always says \"intelligent people will take heed.\"\r\n                            38:55\r\n                            The other verse, [17:36] You shall not accept any information, unless you verify it for yourself. I have given you the hearing, the eyesight, and the brain, and you are responsible for using them.\r\n                            39:10\r\n                            These are two verses from Quran. And God says in Quran \"believers are brothers.\"\r\n                            39:16\r\n                            And, [49:12] O you who believe, you shall avoid any suspicion, for even a little bit of suspicion is sinful. You shall not spy, nor shall you backbite one another; this is as abominable as eating the flesh of your dead brother.\r\n                            39:33\r\n                            Because he cannot defend himself when you are backbiting him.\r\n                            39:39\r\n                            Now in this, Rashad, if I have your permission, just I want to talk on the Khutba.\r\n                            39:45\r\n                            There are some points which I want only to ask questions.\r\n                            39:51\r\n                            First, Behrouz brother said \"we shouldn't call him by his name, as Rashad.\"\r\n                            39:59\r\n                            Which, there is a mistranslation of verse 24:63. Which, could you please open it?\r\n                            40:06\r\n                            24:63. It doesn't say \"don't call him by name like you each other.\"\r\n                            40:14\r\n                            \"Don't take his invitation, his request like your invitation.\"\r\n                            40:19\r\n                            Because he is leader, he is messenger of God, you must obey him. But in respect of calling him with name, it is human being like us.\r\n                            40:28\r\n                            And all messenger has been called with their name. And even now you call Muhammad as Muhammad, Moses as Moses.\r\n                            40:35\r\n                            God says \"they are human being like you.\" Which, what kind of difference God show us?\r\n                            40:40\r\n                            Which respect is they are different we must respect? And which respect they are like us?\r\n                            40:46\r\n                            They are walking in the city. They eat like us. Edip: This is not what which is mistranslated.\r\n                            40:56\r\n                            [24:63] Do not treat the messenger's requests as you treat each others' requests.\r\n                            41:01\r\n                            And also in the context if you look, some people they do not take serious invitation of the messenger. And they are wavering.\r\n                            41:10\r\n                            And the second point, \"we shouldn't discuss with him\", brother said. Why?\r\n                            41:16\r\n                            Doesn't he make mistakes? Only God doesn't make mistakes.\r\n                            41:22\r\n                            What about verses 60:12?\r\n                            41:28\r\n                            What about that verse 60:12?\r\n                            41:34\r\n                            Here, from Hadith... Quran, Hadith and Islam, the verse 60:12, the title is \"Obeying the messenger is conditioned\" (underlined).\r\n                            41:46\r\n                            (60:12) وَلَا يَعْصِينَكَ فِى مَعْرُوفٍۢ Nor disobey you when you are right.\r\n                            41:55\r\n                            That means, believers sometimes they may see something wrong and they can criticize.\r\n                            42:01\r\n                            Even they can, that time they can disobey. This is conditioned.\r\n                            42:06\r\n                            A woman: 60 Edip: 60 and 12.\r\n                            42:12\r\n                            A man: What chapter? Edip: Chapter 60, verse 12. Edip: 60.\r\n                            42:18\r\n                            A man: 6 0. Edip: Yes, 6 0. A man: 6 0? Edip: Yes.\r\n                            42:23\r\n                            Edip: Here, in this book, it is underlined, \"Nor disobey you, nor disobey you, messenger, when you are right.\"\r\n                            42:32\r\n                            Or in the translation I'm reading, \"righteous command.\" Obeying the messenger is conditioned.\r\n                            42:40\r\n                            What is the condition? God says \"anything good that happens to you is from God, and anything bad that happens to you is from you.\"\r\n                            42:48\r\n                            That's messengers, like human, they make mistakes, and these are not from God. These are from themselves, and God may change later, forgive them.\r\n                            43:01\r\n                            A woman: Is it okay if we discuss this briefly?\r\n                            43:07\r\n                            There are some differences between discussion and argument.\r\n                            43:13\r\n                            Laurie: And what would happen if... Edip: I'm coming to the subject, thank you. Edip: Laurie, you are right, I'm coming to the subject.\r\n                            43:21\r\n                            Edip: What about verse 3, chapter 3, verse 159?\r\n                            43:27\r\n                            God says, messenger must consult people around him. This is duty of messenger.\r\n                            43:33\r\n                            And if people around him are zero, they have no idea, they don't, frankly, they don't say\r\n                            43:42\r\n                            their idea, they're only, they just, messenger whatever he says, okay, accept, true.\r\n                            43:48\r\n                            Messenger, 1 plus 0 is 1. Messenger says 12, 12 plus 0 is 12.\r\n                            43:56\r\n                            6, messenger says 6, he says 0. 6 plus 0 is 6. There is no change.\r\n                            44:03\r\n                            What is the reason of consultation of messenger with believer? According to Quran, believers has also personality.\r\n                            44:11\r\n                            They have all their idea. They are not fool people. The messenger: Wow! Wow!\r\n                            44:18\r\n                            A woman: Wow! The messenger: Mã Shã Allãh People: Wow!\r\n                            44:26\r\n                            The messenger: Mã Shã Allãh. Congratulations! It worked. It worked Come here.\r\n                            44:32\r\n                            A man: Don't go over there. Come here. Behrouz: Mã Shã Allãh.\r\n                            44:38\r\n                            Edip: The other point, we must, one lady, one sincere lady, believer, because of last week,\r\n                            44:48\r\n                            we had discussion with Rashad. I, this my (unintelligible), really according to Quran, we made mistake and I repented because of this.\r\n                            44:56\r\n                            But, I will tell you something, more important than this mistake, more important than this mistake, but we forget this, we want to cover the subject.\r\n                            45:08\r\n                            Why a person shouts? Every shouting person are not the same.\r\n                            45:15\r\n                            If you punch.... person comes here, shout, because he is....\r\n                            45:22\r\n                            Edip: So, God needs angels for other things.\r\n                            45:31\r\n                            Third claim, third verse, God is the Alpha.\r\n                            45:41\r\n                            (57:3) هُوَ ٱلْأَوَّلُ وَٱلْـَٔاخِرُ He is the beginning. And also this verse 57:3, and other verse, God is the Creator, is the Creator of everything.\r\n                            46:02\r\n                            There are many verses about this, for example, 13.16.\r\n                            46:08\r\n                            Edip: God didn't create, did not create, or could not create hydrogen, Hydrogen. A woman: What?!\r\n                            46:22\r\n                            Edip: Yes. A woman: What does it have to... Edip: Wait. Wait.\r\n                            46:29\r\n                            Edip: In that discussion, we made. The messenger: Who said all those black things? Edip: Behrouz said, and you accepted, Rashad.\r\n                            46:37\r\n                            The messenger: So, I said, I said that God is not Omnipotent? Edip: Excuse me? The messenger: You heard me say \"God is not Omnipotent.\"\r\n                            46:44\r\n                            Edip: God.... no, no, I don't say you didn't say God is Omnipotent. The messenger: Wait, wait, wait. The messenger: Does anybody in this room believe that God is not Omnipotent? Raise your hand, please. Anyone?\r\n                            46:52\r\n                            Edip: I only want... The messenger: Wait, wait. Hold it. Hold it. The messenger: Does anyone in this room believe that God is not Omnipotent? He is able to do anything.\r\n                            46:59\r\n                            Does anyone here believe that? Okay, the first issue is finished. The messenger: There is nobody here who does not believe.... Edip: But God is, Rashad, the only is (unintelligible).\r\n                            47:08\r\n                            The messenger: There is nobody in this room who believes that God is not Omnipotent. So, this is finished. Edip: What about this God cannot do this, this, without this. If we say God cannot do, even if He wants, cannot do this.\r\n                            47:18\r\n                            Edip: Isn't this really reduced God's condition, the omnipotence of God?\r\n                            47:24\r\n                            Edip: This contradicts itself. The messenger: No, you have to go talk to some people who don't believe that is Omnipotent. We all believe God is omnipotent.\r\n                            47:30\r\n                            Edip: Okay, can we say God can do whatever He wants? The messenger: Yes. Edip: Alhamdu Lillah. Thank God.\r\n                            47:35\r\n                            Edip: Please, we erase this, this problem. Ok. Edip: This was the discussion.\r\n                            47:41\r\n                            The messenger: This was always the case. It was never otherwise. A woman: That's right. The rest of us that were at the discussion, indeed, didn't take it that way.\r\n                            47:48\r\n                            The messenger: Go ahead, what was the second point? Edip: Okay, thank God. Yes, I want to be liar. Really, I want to be, in this case, liar. Because I don't want to make trouble.\r\n                            47:57\r\n                            But God knows. God knows everything. Edip: IN SHAA ALLAH, even if Rashad said he must repent, if he doesn't remember, it is better for him.\r\n                            How to treat the messengers Request & Opinions. Edip argues with Dr. Rashad Khalifa and accuses the Dr. Rashad Khalifa of not believing in God’s omnipotents.\r\n                            48:05\r\n                            But I remember, I heard from my ears, the discussion was about this. Anyway, God needs angels. We cannot say this, IN SHAA ALLAH. That's correct?\r\n                            48:15\r\n                            Behrouz: You're missing the point. Let's bring up the subject that we were talking about.\r\n                            48:20\r\n                            Chapter 15, starting from 74 to 78. Just read the whole thing.\r\n                            48:26\r\n                            Behrouz: It's gonna tell you that God turned upside down the city of Lot by the angels. That is God's system. God's system never change. And that's it. You wanna go into it....\r\n                            48:39\r\n                            The messenger: [49:1] O you who believe, do not place your opinion above that of GOD and His messenger. You shall reverence GOD. GOD is Hearer, Omniscient.\r\n                            48:49\r\n                            [49:2] O you who believe, do not raise your voices above the voice of the prophet,... This is the Prophet Muhammad, and it is set as an example for us.\r\n                            48:58\r\n                            [49:2] .... nor shall you shout at him as you shout at each other,.... Why is God saying this? Why? He tells us why.\r\n                            49:05\r\n                            [49:2].... lest your works become nullified while you do not perceive.\r\n                            49:11\r\n                            Why will my work be nullified if I shout at the messenger? Or if I raise my opinion above the opinion of the messenger? How will my work be nullified?\r\n                            49:20\r\n                            \"I pray five times a day. I fast the month of Ramadan. I worship God alone.\" What God is telling me \"if you place your opinion above that of God and the messenger, your works are nullified.\"\r\n                            49:34\r\n                            What is the mechanism of nullifying my works by doing this?\r\n                            49:39\r\n                            Here's the mechanism. Because when I do this to the messenger, and there is an outsider who will come and see this,\r\n                            49:46\r\n                            now the outsider comes and sees that one of the closest persons to the messenger is telling him\r\n                            49:52\r\n                            \"you don't believe in God's Omnipotence. You don't believe that this and that.\"\r\n                            49:57\r\n                            So, the outsider will leave. Okay, and become a disbeliever, for example. If I do this and drive the outsider away, I will carry this person's sins.\r\n                            50:08\r\n                            This is how my works will be nullified. Why is God saying this?\r\n                            50:13\r\n                            Is God advocating idol worship, or what? Of course not. So, there is a reason for it.\r\n                            50:19\r\n                            But, see, you see now what the point is. Edip came to a certain conclusion, and he made an opinion, and he didn't wanna give it up.\r\n                            50:30\r\n                            He still doesn't want to give it up. Edip: I just....Rashad, this is correct, this is wrong. This is...\r\n                            50:38\r\n                            Whatever people you ask, if some person, if any being... The messenger: Okay, you're still on number one. So, let me go to number one.\r\n                            50:46\r\n                            Edip says that I say that God is not Omnipotent. The messenger: Of course, I never said that. Edip: No, no, the second one.\r\n                            50:51\r\n                            Edip: The second one contradicts God. The messenger: I said that God cannot turn Sodom upside down without the angels. The messenger: Is this what you are saying?\r\n                            50:58\r\n                            Edip: Excuse me? Edip: If God was, He is Omnipotent, He can do without angels. The messenger: without angels.\r\n                            51:04\r\n                            The messenger: Okay, then let us look at this. Let's see what God says, and we cannot be more godly than God. I'm going to use an example that is identical.\r\n                            51:14\r\n                            And this, God says that the creation of Jesus is like the creation of Adam, equal to the creation of Adam. We're all familiar with this verse.\r\n                            51:22\r\n                            And then God goes on in the verse and says \"I said to him, be, and he was.\" So, this is how God gets things done. God can get anything done, by saying \"be\", and it is, right?\r\n                            51:35\r\n                            Yet, we look at the Quran consistently about the creation of Adam. We see that God says \"I blew into Adam from My spirit.\"\r\n                            51:43\r\n                            Because that was up there in the first heaven. Adam was up there. God was up there. And God blew into Adam from His spirit.\r\n                            51:52\r\n                            Now, the identical creation of Jesus, God said to Jesus, \"be\", and he was.\r\n                            51:57\r\n                            God said \"be\" and he was. But God tells us in the Quran, He sent the angel to Mary, carrying this command \"to be.\"\r\n                            52:10\r\n                            And God speaks in the plural. The messenger: He said \"we blew into Mary from our spirit.\"\r\n                            52:15\r\n                            Edip: There's a question, Rashad. Does He... The messenger: So, therefore, therefore, God is teaching us that there is a system of be, and it is.\r\n                            52:23\r\n                            God didn't just sit up there in the first universe, He said \"be\", and Jesus was.\r\n                            52:31\r\n                            The mechanism was that the angel Gabriel came down to the planet earth, which cannot stand the physical presence of God, and Gabriel carried that command.\r\n                            52:42\r\n                            And \"we blew into her from our spirit.\" So, this is the difference. God tells us about the system. Now, I cannot say that God said, be, to Jesus, and Jesus was, without the intervention of the angel.\r\n                            52:56\r\n                            I cannot say that, because it will be a lie. Satan, when Satan failed to stop you from worshipping God, he will push you to the other extreme.\r\n                            53:07\r\n                            He will make you demand of God more than what God Himself said.\r\n                            53:14\r\n                            So, this is the situation that we have here. In other words, God said He sent the angel to create Jesus, and then we say \"God doesn't need the angel.\"\r\n                            53:25\r\n                            Well, who am I to decide that? God Himself told us that He sent the angel with the command. These are two identical things.\r\n                            53:34\r\n                            And you can... God also said He sent the angels to turn Sodom upside down.\r\n                            53:39\r\n                            So, I cannot say otherwise. I have to abide by what God said.\r\n                            53:46\r\n                            If God said He sent the angels to turn it upside down, I can't say that God can sit up there and say \"be\", and it is upside down.\r\n                            53:55\r\n                            God is teaching us that there is a system, there is a mechanism. But the point that Behrouz is talking about is nullifying our works.\r\n                            “Nullifying our works”.\r\n                            54:05\r\n                            And it brings out this very serious idol worship that is idolizing our opinion.\r\n                            54:12\r\n                            We must give up our opinion in favor of God's opinion. God said He sent the angel to blow into Mary from God's spirit, through the mediation of the angel, we have to believe that.\r\n                            54:25\r\n                            Edip: Rashad, did I say, please, did I say \"God didn't send angels?\" Did I say \"God doesn't use angels?\"\r\n                            54:31\r\n                            I only say \"God uses angels, but this doesn't mean God needs angels.\" God has obligation, needs them.\r\n                            54:39\r\n                            Edip: God doesn't need anybody. But God.... may God select the angels. The messenger: What did you say now?\r\n                            54:45\r\n                            A woman: I think maybe it's the difference between the words, God wants to use the angels, and maybe God won't control without angels, but it's not that God cannot.\r\n                            54:58\r\n                            A woman: Do you know what I mean? God can do everything, but God has chosen His system, and He will use them. The messenger: We have a linguist here.\r\n                            55:06\r\n                            The messenger: What is the difference between \"want\" and \"need\", Martha?\r\n                            55:11\r\n                            The messenger: No, I want you to answer this first, then go on. Edip: God wanted this, or God needed this. Martha: I think we don't need a linguist to answer that question.\r\n                            55:20\r\n                            The messenger: OK. Tell us what you think. Martha: Can I just back up? The messenger: No, just tell us the difference between \"need\" and \"want\", first.\r\n                            55:28\r\n                            Martha: Need implies a certain dependency on something else.\r\n                            55:34\r\n                            Martha: Want is something that you have a decision about meaning you're choosing to do one thing as opposed to another.\r\n                            55:43\r\n                            The messenger: Okay, what's the question? A woman: I wasn't here for the original thing, right.\r\n                            55:48\r\n                            A woman: I just have this fear that what's happening is the devil is just kind of getting in between us here based on just a real, maybe a misunderstanding. The messenger: Yes.\r\n                            56:00\r\n                            A woman: Are you saying that Rashad said, number one, two, and the ones that are in black there?\r\n                            56:08\r\n                            Edip: The black is what Rashad said. A woman: Ok. Wait a second, wait a second.\r\n                            56:13\r\n                            A woman: Rashad, did you say those things? The messenger: No. A woman: It's the end. Edip: You didn't say that God cannot control without angels, cannot do this without angels, Rashad, that day. Lisa, he didn't say this?\r\n                            56:25\r\n                            Edip: He didn't say this? Thank God. You forgot. Alhamdu Lillah. Edip: I will foget. The messenger: No, we didn't forget.\r\n                            56:33\r\n                            A woman: You're the only one that said that. The messenger: Ahmad? Ahmad: There is another Aya in the Quran that says that God wants all the big people to believe, He can do it. Right?\r\n                            56:43\r\n                            Ahmad: So, there is a difference between me and God. Edip: Sure. Mã Shã Allãh. Ahmad: So, He can want, He can do all of these things without angels, but His system specifies angels to do this. Edip: Sure.\r\n                            56:56\r\n                            Ahmad: And to do that, and to do that. The messenger: That's exactly what we were saying. That's what I said.\r\n                            57:03\r\n                            A man: I think the whole problem with everything that's being said is that everybody in this room believes number one. Everybody does.\r\n                            57:09\r\n                            We don't believe number two. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. So then, verbs like we use, can, or need, or has to, they don't apply.\r\n                            57:22\r\n                            You can't say, like Rashad said,....\r\n                            57:30\r\n                            ....God in a different way, or can do things, or needs to do things. These are verbs that don't apply to God.\r\n                            57:36\r\n                            A woman: I don't think any of this.... Edip: Okay. Edip: This was the discussion, this was the discussion, and many times has been used word can. You can't call...\r\n                            57:47\r\n                            Edip: Alhamdu Lillah. A woman: No, but we're all worried, right? The messenger: Right. You hit the nail on the head\r\n                            57:55\r\n                            Apamea: Okay. And there are many people here that cannot speak it. And his people, does he believe, are his brothers, turn against him.\r\n                            Dr. Rashad Khalifa says “Edip Yuksel has a serious problem and we are trying to help him”\r\n                            58:03\r\n                            A woman: Nobody is turning against him. Behrouz: No one is turn against him. Behrouz: No one is racing with him. He's making up these things. I am not racing with him. None of us over here, we're racing with him.\r\n                            58:15\r\n                            Apamea: Edip is not the kind... Edip: Okay, Rashad, what is the... The messenger: Edip has a severe problem, and we're trying to help him.\r\n                            58:21\r\n                            A man: Yeah. Behrouz: That's all. The messenger: We are his brothers, we are his brothers and sisters, and we're trying to help him. He has a real, he has a severe, has a very severer problem that may destroy... Edip: Rashad, why don't you... in the last question... my last question. I shouted at you, Rashad, please. Apamea: He needed to know that he heard you right.\r\n                            58:36\r\n                            Behrouz: Now, the one thing happened. Wait, wait. How come Ismail Barakat does not have any linguistic problem?\r\n                            58:42\r\n                            His English is perfect. He understood it, and he repented. He said \"I'm sorry.\" Edip: No, you all didn't accept... in fact, you cannot use Behrouz: Come on.\r\n                            58:51\r\n                            Edip: \"God cannot do this.\" Behrouz: He, at latest, he said \"I'm sorry\" Edip: Oh, he did not... he actually shouted at messenger. Behrouz: Well, his English is perfect.\r\n                            58:58\r\n                            The messenger: He shouts at everybody. Ok, the man is... Edip: Rashad, one question.\r\n                            59:04\r\n                            Edip: Why don't you worry about this brother? You worried about me because I shouted at you because I may misunderstand, I may understand according to Quran, I see....\r\n                            59:15\r\n                            The messenger: No, I worry about you because you worship your opinion to the point of destroying you. Dr. Sabahi wants to say something. Edip: Ok. Last question. Excuse me, only this part is not....\r\n                            59:23\r\n                            Edip: Did you say that God did not create hydrogen? Did you say that day? God is witness.\r\n                            59:28\r\n                            Behrouz: Edip, JAN, you were telling me millions of crazy things. You brought it from your mind. I don't know where.\r\n                            59:34\r\n                            Edip: Rashad warned me, but you said \"God cannot create, He didn't create hydrogen.\" The messenger: Nobody will say that, Edip. Nobody will say that. Nobody will say that.\r\n                            59:43\r\n                            The messenger: You thought he said. You thought he said that. Behrouz: The only reason I'm worried about you is because I love you. The messenger: God created everything.\r\n                            59:50\r\n                            Behrouz: I love you and I know you know a lot. Edip: Did he say... Behrouz: I sit over there, I ask you all the Arabic. Edip: Did he say it or not?\r\n                            59:55\r\n                            The messenger: No, he did not. I was there. Edip: Please, for the (unintelligible) of God.\r\n                            1:00:00\r\n                            The messenger: There's a statement in the Quran. Hold it. Okay, Mohtasham. Edip: I give up. I lied. The messenger: Mohtasham. Edip, Edip. Edip, Behrouz.\r\n                            1:00:10\r\n                            There's a statement in the Quran says, (39:62) ٱللَّهُ خَـٰلِقُ كُلِّ شَىْءٍۢ Okay? God is the Creator of all things.\r\n                            1:00:16\r\n                            The messenger: Everybody believes that. We all believe that. Edip: Subhan Allah. Mã Shã Allãh. Edip: God is witness, he said this. The messenger: You think He said this.\r\n                            1:00:21\r\n                            Edip: No, he said. From His face, you understand he's lying now. Behrouz: No, I'm not lying. You said, you said, you said \"God create everything from nothing.\"\r\n                            1:00:32\r\n                            And I said \"so if something created from nothing, that must be nothing.\" That was your reason. The messenger: Yes. Behrouz: Did you understand it? So, God is nothing.\r\n                            1:00:40\r\n                            Behrouz: You said \"God is nothing.\" Edip: No. The messenger: See? Behrouz: Come on. The messenger: It's the same... It's the same problem. Behrouz: It's the same thing.\r\n                            1:00:48\r\n                            The messenger: You can take a statement out of context. Behrouz: I don't understand. The messenger: Dr. Sabahi.\r\n                            1:00:55\r\n                            A woman: It's just a misunderstanding of the words. We all agree that the black things there are not correct. And whoever... Someone here heard it wrong or used the wrong vocabulary, but we all agree that the black is not right. Edip: Alhamdu Lillah. There's no problem.\r\n                            1:01:07\r\n                            A woman: and that the red is in the Quran and it's the right thing. So, we all agree. The messenger: Right. Mã Shã Allãh.\r\n                            1:01:13\r\n                            The messenger: Dr. Sabahi. Dr. Sabahi: I wanna read Sura 114\r\n                            1:01:20\r\n                            أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem [114:1] Say, \"I seek refuge in the Lord of the people. [114:2] \"The King of the people. [114:3] \"The god of the people.\r\n                            1:01:33\r\n                            [114:4] \"From the evils of sneaky whisperers. [114:5] \"Who whisper into the chests of the people. [114:6] \"Be they of the jinns, or the people.\"\r\n                            1:01:44\r\n                            I just speak in interpretation for yourself. I was the teacher last Friday. And I read verse 110, Sura 3.\r\n                            1:01:57\r\n                            The Best Community. And then I referred you to verse 103.\r\n                            1:02:03\r\n                            [3:103] You shall hold fast to the rope of GOD, all of you, and do not be divided. Recall GOD's blessings upon you—you used to be enemies and He reconciled your hearts. By His grace, you became brethren. You were at the brink of a pit of fire, and He saved you. GOD thus explains His revelations for you, that you may be guided.\r\n                            1:02:25\r\n                            [3:104] Let there be a community of you who invite to goodness, advocate righteousness, and forbid evil. These are the successful ones.\r\n                            1:02:33\r\n                            [3:105] Do not be like those who became divided and disputed, despite the clear proofs that comes to them. These have incurred a terrible retribution.\r\n                            1:02:43\r\n                            [3:106] The day will come when some faces will be brightened (with joy), while other faces will be darkened (with misery). As for those whose faces are darkened, they will be asked, \"Did you not disbelieve after believing? Consequently, taste the retribution for your disbelief.\"\r\n                            1:02:59\r\n                            I guess if you are good students of the Quran, this would never happen to us.\r\n                            1:03:07\r\n                            The messenger: That's right. Dr. Sabahi: Believe me, I call you Rashad, Dr. Khalifa, before this (unintelligible), I didn't know anything about what has happened.\r\n                            1:03:21\r\n                            And tonight, when he explained, Edip, I didn't see a big thing about it.\r\n                            1:03:27\r\n                            Because what I understood is a misunderstanding, and the rest of it is whispering and making it big.\r\n                            1:03:34\r\n                            Looking at Edip and this mosque for the last year and a half or so, or even more, I know that\r\n                            1:03:43\r\n                            we put God's Omnipotence above everything else. I know what you stand for, and I know what everybody here, most of the people, at least\r\n                            1:03:53\r\n                            the ones that I stand for, and I think I know what Edip stands for.\r\n                            1:03:59\r\n                            And if he has an ego, I guess all of us have more or less.\r\n                            1:04:04\r\n                            But at the same time, I guess, I never doubt his belief in the Quran or in God's Omnipotence or you as being the messenger.\r\n                            1:04:16\r\n                            But if something comes up, and we make it bigger and bigger, I'm surprised, I agree with Naghmeh.\r\n                            1:04:24\r\n                            As someone who doesn't know anything, how can all of a sudden things turn from day to night?\r\n                            1:04:32\r\n                            You know, if you're telling me that somebody's shouting at Rashad, he's gonna think that what is going on in here.\r\n                            1:04:40\r\n                            Imagine if somebody comes in, last week he was sitting next to Rashad, he was giving\r\n                            1:04:46\r\n                            all the opinions, and he's a knowledgeable person, all of a sudden, now we don't even let him talk.\r\n                            1:04:51\r\n                            I don't, I don't support this anger, this excitement, you know, but, you know, what I'm saying is, if we believe that we are believers here,\r\n                            1:05:04\r\n                            respect each other, as God is saying in this \"don't dispute among yourselves.\"\r\n                            1:05:10\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: Edip does something wrong, you have to call him in, sit down, and try to, he's a logical person. The messenger: Exactly, that's what we're doing here.\r\n                            1:05:16\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: So, now, I'm telling the truth, this is not the feeling that I get from sitting here for about 45 minutes.\r\n                            1:05:25\r\n                            Everybody is, you know, attacking him, at least the people who have seen his outbursts in that day.\r\n                            1:05:30\r\n                            It is not fair. A man: It is A woman: (unintelligible) Dr. Sabahi: No, that is... I agree. Is she... That's why I objected very strongly to Behrouz's Khutba because we didn't know it was Quran.\r\n                            1:05:43\r\n                            You come in and you drop the bomb. If something went on... The messenger: He read the Quran. He read the Quran. Dr. Sabahi: No, I agree. But I didn't like... The messenger: No, let's...\r\n                            1:05:51\r\n                            The messenger: Okay, let me say something here, because we just witnessed a commandment of God being broken, and we...\r\n                            1:05:58\r\n                            Whatever you do, you're nice words will not fix the wound that he's been stabbed with. This is a very nice, very gentle man.\r\n                            Edip accuses a follower of being a “liar”. Dr. Rashad Khalifa explains this is wrong.\r\n                            1:06:04\r\n                            And somebody told him \"you're a liar.\" And we're all sitting here indifferent. How can we fix his wound now?\r\n                            1:06:10\r\n                            The messenger: You think everything will be alright? We read, we read here. Edip: Rashad, I have one... The messenger: Let me finish. See what God is saying Edip: God....\r\n                            1:06:21\r\n                            \"tell my servants,...\" this is 287, [17:53] Tell My servants to treat each other in the best possible manner, for the devil will always try to drive a wedge among them. Surely, the devil is man's most ardent enemy.\r\n                            1:06:34\r\n                            Now, I want you to put yourself in Behrouz's place, and somebody is calling you a liar.\r\n                            1:06:40\r\n                            The messenger: (unintelligible). Is this what God is saying \"Tell my servants to treat each other in the best possible manner\"?\r\n                            1:06:45\r\n                            He's getting deeper and deeper in trouble with God. And what you just read is to advocate righteousness and forbid evil.\r\n                            1:06:53\r\n                            We cannot sit indifferently and watch Edip blaspheme against God and hurt one of our people, his brother, in this way.\r\n                            1:07:06\r\n                            I mean, do you think Behrouz will sleep tonight? I mean, do you have any consideration for his feelings? Edip: What about my feelings? The messenger: Can we just pass it up?\r\n                            1:07:13\r\n                            The messenger: Can we pass up the fact that he was called a liar unjustly? Or even justly?\r\n                            1:07:21\r\n                            Edip: Rashad. The messenger: So,... yes? A woman: I think the messenger has some feelings. You are a human being and he was (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:07:29\r\n                            The messenger: There is one of the witnesses there. Edip: Rashad, excuse me, Rashad. There is one person who has not listened to this conversation. The messenger: Who?\r\n                            1:07:37\r\n                            Edip: Ismail Barakat. He doesn't know whatever I say or Behrouz says. Just like record, ask him what was the conversation, what we discussed, why he shouted at you like me.\r\n                            1:07:48\r\n                            The messenger: Well, first of all, you owe Behrouz an apology because you committed a breaking of the commandment right here. Edip: First of all, Behrouz, I am ready.\r\n                            1:07:54\r\n                            Edip: I know that now I say and you are here, I know exactly Behrouz said \"God didn't create hydrogen.\"\r\n                            1:08:02\r\n                            Edip: I will shoot like my belief. Edip: If you let witness God... The messenger: Ok. I can tell you God says here...\r\n                            1:08:08\r\n                            Edip: Are you ready? Are you ready that you say... I'm ready. A man: No, no, no. Don't shout. Don't shout. Edip: I'm ready. I leave, I leave to God. I will not speak English. I leave to God.\r\n                            1:08:18\r\n                            Edip: Whoever is liar, God will curse him. A man: No, don't say that. Edip: This is accusation.\r\n                            1:08:24\r\n                            The messenger: No, see, I can tell you what God said. OK? You want to see what God said in the Quran?\r\n                            1:08:35\r\n                            A woman: God knows what he said. Edip: He must repent, he must repent like me. I repent to God.\r\n                            1:08:41\r\n                            Behrouz: You did? Edip: Yes, sure. Behrouz: For this past seven, eight days? Edip: Sure. Behrouz: None of us saw it. And you didn't show anything. You didn't talk to any of us. Edip: I didn't bless him...\r\n                            1:08:49\r\n                            Behrouz: OK? Apamea: I've seen him at home, Behrouz. I've seen him. He's been suffering as much as everybody else.\r\n                            1:08:55\r\n                            Behrouz: I know he is. The messenger: Ok. Behrouz: But Why...? Apamea: I have been suffering along with him. Behrouz: Why all this didn't help him? The messenger: OK, God said, God said in the Quran \"after the people die and they turn into dust and bones, they come back to life? This is ridiculous.\" This is what God said.\r\n                            1:09:09\r\n                            The messenger: Is it true? The messenger: God said, this is what you're saying Behrouz said.\r\n                            1:09:15\r\n                            Edip: This is quotation. The messenger: Because God is saying in the Quran, The messenger: I can show you, God said \"after the people die and become dust and bones, do they come back to life? This is ridiculous.\"\r\n                            1:09:26\r\n                            The messenger: So, you think God said that? Edip: Yes, God is quoting. The messenger: Right, this is how you are misquoting Behrouz, because we were all there.\r\n                            1:09:34\r\n                            We all know that God created everything. It is not fair to take something out of context just to defend your opinion.\r\n                            1:09:42\r\n                            You just wipe out your friends and your brothers just to hold you to your opinion. You don't wanna say you're wrong.\r\n                            1:09:48\r\n                            Edip: OK, I accept I'm wrong. The messenger: Ali. Edip: Alhamdu Lillah, The messenger: Ali. Edip: But God knows what happens. The messenger: But who's but?\r\n                            1:09:56\r\n                            The messenger: Ali. Ali: I thought it was just something else. Ali: He saw there was maybe something wrong and he just kind of stepped back and let it build up.\r\n                            1:10:04\r\n                            Maybe if there was something wrong, you know, he brought it up. Ali: He brought it up in front of all of us. The messenger: Yes. Ali: He didn't say anything behind your back or his back.\r\n                            1:10:12\r\n                            Ali: He just said it right here. The messenger: Well... Ali: No, I'm just saying. He said there was something... He thought there was something wrong.\r\n                            1:10:18\r\n                            I don't even know what it's about. But he thought there was something wrong. I don't know if it is or it's not. And I'm not taking sides.\r\n                            1:10:24\r\n                            And he got up and he talked. And I think about courage to talk in front of people. Then, all of a sudden, all you people whispering, saying that he's laughing at, smiling, going, ha ha, this is your right.\r\n                            1:10:34\r\n                            Ali: They said \"he's confident.\" Of course, he... The messenger: Who told you we were whispering? Ali: Man, I can look. I can understand.\r\n                            1:10:40\r\n                            How many times do you think all the great men of our century, the people who stood up for their rights, guys, I mean, if Martin Luther King didn't stand up, what would have happened?\r\n                            1:10:50\r\n                            You know, if all those people didn't stand up for their rights, what would have happened? He stood up and he saw something, maybe something was wrong, and he tried to fix it before it got bigger.\r\n                            Dr. Rashad Khalifa says “Edip Yuksel's god is his opinion” – Dr. Rashad Khalifa says Edip Yuksel will end up in hell.\r\n                            1:11:00\r\n                            Ali: And I think you guys should be thankful for this man for being here and standing up and saying... The messenger: No, you got to pull it off, sir.\r\n                            1:11:05\r\n                            Ali: I don't think that you should be mad at him. Ali: I think if there is... The messenger: Yeah, I'm not...\r\n                            1:11:10\r\n                            A woman: Edip is making false accusations... Ali: No, if there's false... Then what? Ali: How do you know it's false? A woman: Because I was there. I was there. I was there. Behrouz: There were seven people seated over here watching.\r\n                            1:11:19\r\n                            Ali: Also, we're all human beings, we're all allowed to make mistakes. Ali: To me, it just means to make one mistake isn't...\r\n                            1:11:26\r\n                            A woman: It was serious mistakes in the Quran. Ali: So, we're all humans. A woman: The most serious is... A man: No excuse, no compromise.\r\n                            1:11:34\r\n                            The messenger: That's exactly what he's doing, Apamea. This is exactly what he's doing, idol worship. He's worshiping his opinion.\r\n                            1:11:39\r\n                            My estimate of the situation from all the things I learned in my life is that Edip is in a serious, serious trouble.\r\n                            1:11:46\r\n                            He idolizes his opinion. And unless he changes, he's gonna go to Hell.\r\n                            1:11:52\r\n                            This is just the summary of the whole thing. His opinion has more value than God Himself.\r\n                            1:11:59\r\n                            This is what we see in Sura 25, I forget the verse. Remember... Edip: Please state the verse.\r\n                            1:12:05\r\n                            The messenger: Remember, do you know the person whose opinion is his god? And in Arabic, which he understands very well,\r\n                            1:12:11\r\n                            (25:43) أَرَءَيْتَ مَنِ ٱتَّخَذَ إِلَـٰهَهُۥ هَوَىٰهُ His god, right now, is his opinion and I'm hoping that\r\n                            1:12:17\r\n                            he will snap out of it someday and give in to God's opinion.\r\n                            1:12:22\r\n                            This is what was happening. Edip: Mahmoud also at that time was witness of conversation.\r\n                            1:12:28\r\n                            He is a sincere believer also. Edip: Why not ask him or ask...\r\n                            1:12:33\r\n                            The messenger: About what? The messenger: Ask him, go ahead. Edip: Please, I'm suffering now because there is something which, Rashad, is not clear.\r\n                            1:12:41\r\n                            The messenger: Ask him, ask him. A man: Edip, you are making (unintelligible). Edip: No, no, what happened? Did somebody say \"God cannot control this?\" Did somebody say \"God didn't create?\" Am I lying? Let's ask this guy...\r\n                            1:12:51\r\n                            The messenger: Well, did God say \"after we died, we're resurrected? This is ridiculous\"? Edip: If I am lying, ask Ismail Barakat, he will not hear my lie.\r\n                            1:12:57\r\n                            Edip: Please ask Isamil Barakat \"what happened?\" He will say exactly what I said. Edip: There is a truth.\r\n                            1:13:03\r\n                            The messenger: The fact.... Edip: I am ready for this truth. A woman: Maybe you heard it wrong, Edip, and you were... Edip: Isamil Barakat heard it wrong?\r\n                            1:13:10\r\n                            A woman: At least now we know that the fact is God did create hydrogen. Edip: I'm happy, if I agree, I am happy. I accept that they made a mistake, now they repent.\r\n                            1:13:19\r\n                            The messenger: Behrouz never said \"God did not create hydrogen.\" Behrouz never said that. Edip thought that Behrouz said that.\r\n                            1:13:26\r\n                            The messenger: Or Edip misunderstood what Behrouz is saying. As simple as that. Apamea: Why did he say that? The messenger: Nobody.... Apamea: Ok. Edip: Rashad, ....\r\n                            1:13:33\r\n                            The messenger: What? Edip: Are just next to him, you were there, Rashad? You cannot witness what he said The messenger: Yes.\r\n                            1:13:39\r\n                            The messenger: Listen, I don't have, I don't have really, I really don't have to be there to know that Behrouz will never say \"God did not create hydrogen.\"\r\n                            1:13:48\r\n                            The messenger: Dr. Sabahi. Dr. Sabahi: I guess, Edip, you are making a few mistakes because you are speaking to something that you've already decided.\r\n                            1:13:57\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: You don't give even a one part per million or billion chance that you may be wrong, or you may have heard it wrong, or Satan might have intervened. The messenger: Exactly.\r\n                            1:14:08\r\n                            The messenger: Exactly. Dr. Sabahi: And if you dig more and more into it, it is gonna turn ugly.\r\n                            1:14:13\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: Because you want him to say that he said so so that you will be relieved. The messenger: Right.\r\n                            1:14:20\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: And he say that he didn't say so. Edip: Alhamdu Lillah, Dr. Sabahi: Listen, listen, you say that and then again you get... It's not fun but I may... The messenger: Right.\r\n                            1:14:30\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: You have to seriously, all of us, have to seriously think about this and analyze the situation. The messenger: Yes.\r\n                            1:14:36\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: And if you really, really deep down believe that God is the Omnipotent, then He's gonna take care of it.\r\n                            1:14:43\r\n                            If somebody is doing something wrong, if somebody has wrong beliefs, He's gonna be exposed The messenger: Exactly.\r\n                            1:14:48\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: if people think that God is capable of it. So, we don't have to take it in our hands. So, let it drop.\r\n                            1:14:54\r\n                            You can, you know, cool down, get to your work, and let's, you know, you can discuss the issue, discuss it, find the problem.\r\n                            1:15:04\r\n                            But you cannot find the guilt if this is not the cause. The messenger: Exactly. Dr. Sabahi: You cannot find someone. Let God take care of it.\r\n                            1:15:10\r\n                            If things are clear, the things that you were worried about, that God is not Omnipotent, I can't see what you think.\r\n                            1:15:17\r\n                            The messenger: Mã Shã Allãh. Dr. Sabahi: So, I was surprised that you brought that up. From what I understand this is not the case, here.\r\n                            1:15:23\r\n                            These are....Sometimes you may hear something, I wait, and then say \"oh, I made a mistake.\" You hear it, or somebody made a mistake.\r\n                            1:15:31\r\n                            Let them correct themselves. But you are asking too much now. You want someone to come out and say \"I made this mistake. I'm sorry. You are right.\" No, this is not gonna happen.\r\n                            1:15:43\r\n                            Behrouz: And I have to I wanna... The messenger: Mã Shã Allãh, I have to, I have to compliment you for... You found out exactly what the problem is.\r\n                            1:15:50\r\n                            And you just, you put it really better than anyone can possibly put it.\r\n                            1:15:59\r\n                            The messenger: Were you talking? Behrouz: Excuse me. I want to tell Apamea that we all love Edip. And all over the world, they know Edip.\r\n                            1:16:10\r\n                            He is knowledgeable. We appreciate it. And I appreciate it myself because I sit there, and he gives a lot of knowledge to me.\r\n                            1:16:18\r\n                            Ok? And believe me, I suggested to Mahmoud and Mohtasham from the day that happened, that let's, guys, sit... let's sit down and talk to him.\r\n                            1:16:30\r\n                            But God is witness. That was not a day that we could get him by himself.\r\n                            1:16:36\r\n                            You were here. We didn't wanna talk to him in front of you. And we all wanted to talk to him, three of us together.\r\n                            1:16:43\r\n                            Because if someone talked to him, all the things he says, he says \"no.\" Whatever you say, he says \"no.\"\r\n                            1:16:49\r\n                            And then it takes him two days and half \"I found out.\" That say \"okay, you're right.\" But us, me to him, I'm just a stupid.\r\n                            1:16:58\r\n                            I don't know nothing. Okay, now see, this is the impression everybody's getting. Everybody to him, everybody does not understand but him. Okay, thanks.\r\n                            1:17:07\r\n                            Now, we tried to help him. Three days in a row, we tried to get him in a corner.\r\n                            1:17:13\r\n                            \"Hey, this is it, brother.\" We are worried about you. \"Let's repent and forget about it.\"\r\n                            1:17:20\r\n                            And there were seven people witnessing that day. I'm not taking sides. I'm not politician.\r\n                            1:17:26\r\n                            If I was, I wouldn't be here. I would have a beautiful job. I would make a lot of money like the others are doing.\r\n                            1:17:33\r\n                            I'm not the smart outside. I'm just, my heart is very open.\r\n                            1:17:40\r\n                            You will find out later on. And I think this is the reason that I'm here. This is the reason he's here. But when you get over here, you wanna say \"hey, I'm this and that.\" You're gonna lose it.\r\n                            1:17:49\r\n                            And this is what's gonna happen. It's going to happen. But we care about him. We don't want this to happen to him.\r\n                            1:17:55\r\n                            And I'm sure as much as us, you worry about him more. And so as Naghmeh and other friends.\r\n                            1:18:01\r\n                            Apamea: I'm his wife, and I have never seen him opinionated with me. Behrouz: Because you're his wife. Right. Apamea: If anyone he's opinionated with, it's me. I would be the one all the time and he humbles me.\r\n                            1:18:10\r\n                            Behrouz: Yes, that's the love. Behrouz: But the love between you and him.... Apamea: So, I can't comprehend the fact that he's being blamed for being opinionated.\r\n                            1:18:17\r\n                            Apamea: Because he is so humble. Behrouz: To you it is. Apamea: And he is... Behrouz: If I was his wife, he would be humbling.\r\n                            1:18:24\r\n                            The messenger: Edip is in deep trouble. Behrouz: This relationship is different. Behrouz: This is different. The messenger: OK. Behrouz: But to him and me and us sitting over here. We're not proving anything that \"I'm smart, you're smart. No, I'm God's....\"\r\n                            1:18:36\r\n                            Behrouz: Well, unfortunately, this is the impression everybody is getting. The messenger: They cannot... it's Ok. Ok. Let me... The messenger: Let's see what God is saying. Let's see what God is saying.\r\n                            1:18:44\r\n                            Wait a minute. Let's see what God is saying.\r\n                            1:18:49\r\n                            I wanna reiterate what Behrouz said that we all love Edip. We're trying to step him out of it. He's in deep, deep trouble.\r\n                            1:18:56\r\n                            Satan, remember Satan believed in God. Satan knew God. But he was kicked out of God's kingdom because of ego.\r\n                            “If you ever commit idol worship” – Idolizing one’s own opinion.\r\n                            1:19:05\r\n                            We read on page 465, verse 65, Sura 39.\r\n                            1:19:10\r\n                            [39:65] It has been revealed to you,.... And this means every messenger.\r\n                            1:19:17\r\n                            [39:65] .....and to those before you.... every messenger [39:65] ..... that if you ever commit idol worship, all your works will be nullified, and you will be with the losers.\r\n                            1:19:30\r\n                            To idolize one's opinion is stated in the Quran as idol worship. Stated very clearly.\r\n                            1:19:36\r\n                            Idolize one's opinion means you hold fast to it. Just like Dr. Sabahi spotted it.\r\n                            1:19:44\r\n                            And nothing will stand in the way of your opinion. You just hold fast.... This is idol worship.\r\n                            1:19:52\r\n                            Everybody knows Edip is a believer. Everybody knows Edip is knowledgeable.\r\n                            1:19:58\r\n                            Everybody knows he's sincere. But the danger he's in now is that he may fall into this, 65. He may nullify all his works.\r\n                            1:20:07\r\n                            We have to remember that Satan believed in God. And out of love, all of us, we are trying to help him. In fact, they made a committee, Behrouz, Mohtasham and Mahmoud. And they wanted to talk to him.\r\n                            1:20:20\r\n                            The messenger: To help him. Not to attack him. Edip: Rashad, what you didn't inquire...\r\n                            1:20:25\r\n                            The messenger: Dr. Masoud is trying to talk for a long time. The messenger: Go ahead. Dr. Masoud: As a new believer, Alhamdu Lillah.\r\n                            1:20:32\r\n                            One of the side attractions of this place, I call it side attraction, Because the main attraction here for me is God's word, God's message.\r\n                            1:20:41\r\n                            The side attraction for me here was the closeness, Dr. Masoud: the family atmosphere that I saw with you. The messenger: Yes. Right.\r\n                            1:20:48\r\n                            Dr. Masoud: You know, being from Iran, being a Shia, Shia that they taught us,\r\n                            1:20:54\r\n                            I haven't seen anything like this. And this was very, very attractive for me. I brought all my family over here.\r\n                            1:21:01\r\n                            But what I saw today in the Khutba, and what I saw today here, is completely different\r\n                            1:21:07\r\n                            from what I have been thinking during these past two months of coming over here.\r\n                            1:21:13\r\n                            You taught me that the Prophet is a human. I really never thought that the Prophet was human.\r\n                            1:21:18\r\n                            I thought Prophet was walking with a halo, you know, over his head. You couldn't see his face. All these things.\r\n                            1:21:23\r\n                            I came over here and I saw that the Prophet is somebody like me, and somebody like you. You can talk to him.\r\n                            1:21:30\r\n                            You can go and ask him questions. Dr. Masoud: But now you are just completely different people. And this is really, really disappointing. The messenger: This will never change. This will never change.\r\n                            1:21:37\r\n                            The messenger: What do you think Behrouz said, and what do you think should be done? Dr. Masoud: I cannot judge on that because I don't know really. I cannot be proactive in what happened over there. So I'm not going...\r\n                            1:21:46\r\n                            I'm going to leave these two together. But we are going to go back to the community that Dr. Sabahi was in.\r\n                            1:21:52\r\n                            We are going to love each other. We are going to respect each other. And we are going to apologize to each other, every one of us.\r\n                            1:21:59\r\n                            For what happened over here today and what we are teaching to our children. The messenger: This is exactly what Behrouz was calling for. He doesn't want... He wants to follow what God is saying\r\n                            1:22:09\r\n                            to ensure that we are a family. Because God said the believers are a family. The messenger: Douglas.\r\n                            1:22:14\r\n                            Douglas: In Sura 39, verse 18, God says [39:18] They are the ones who examine all words, then follow the best. These are the ones whom GOD has guided; these are the ones who possess intelligence.\r\n                            1:22:27\r\n                            And I think that one of the things that Satan's doing here is that he is making people feel that their words are better than someone else's.\r\n                            1:22:36\r\n                            What we are supposed to do is that whenever we discuss anything or follow the messenger of God or what have you, the ultimate is always God's words.\r\n                            1:22:45\r\n                            Another verse in the Quran is in Sura 58, verse 10. It says, [58:10] Secret conspiracy is the devil's idea, through which he seeks to hurt those who believed.\r\n                            1:22:55\r\n                            He seeks to hurt those who believe. [58:10] ..... However, he cannot hurt them against GOD's will. In GOD the believers shall trust.\r\n                            1:23:03\r\n                            And I think we all should remember that God says in the Quran that He's aware of the innermost thoughts.\r\n                            1:23:09\r\n                            And He will cause to come forth in us all of our weaknesses.\r\n                            1:23:14\r\n                            That He will bring out our weaknesses according to His will and that when these weaknesses come out,\r\n                            1:23:21\r\n                            if we are really sincere and we worship God alone, we will pray to Allah to face them in ourselves and we will follow what is best.\r\n                            1:23:31\r\n                            We will follow and examine the words and follow what is best and we will not try to defend our own weaknesses and our own opinions and our own words.\r\n                            1:23:41\r\n                            Because I think all of us do and God knows this. This is an extremely critical time.\r\n                            1:23:47\r\n                            Not just this situation, but in a very short time and I think all of us feel this.\r\n                            1:23:54\r\n                            The miracle in the Quran, the awareness that Rashad is the Messenger of the Covenant is going to spread like wildfire.\r\n                            1:24:03\r\n                            It is going to spread like wildfire. It's almost as if we are on the verge\r\n                            1:24:08\r\n                            Douglas: of major events and so the family has to be prepared. The messenger: And Satan doesn't like this. Satan doesn't like it.\r\n                            1:24:15\r\n                            Douglas: When you know that people are coming to your house, what do you do? You run and pick up the trash and straighten up and try to make it look good.\r\n                            1:24:21\r\n                            We have to be prepared for what is about to take place.\r\n                            1:24:26\r\n                            The messenger: Alhamdu Lillah. Let us now turn to God and ask him. God never turns us down. We're going to recite Al-Fãtehah that He may keep us all in His path and not a single one in this place,\r\n                            1:24:35\r\n                            not a single one is to be driven away from the path of God.\r\n                            1:24:41\r\n                            So, we leave it in God's hand. He is the only one who can solve our problems. Al-Fãtehah\r\n                            1:24:46\r\n                            Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem (1:1) Al hamdu Lillahi Rabbil ‘Alameen (1:2) Arrahman Arraheem (1:3) Maliki Yawm Eddeen (1:4) Eyyaka Na’abudu Wa Eyyaka Nasta’aeen (1:5) Ehdina Al-Serata Al-Mustaqeem (1:6) Serata Al-Lazeena An’amta ‘Alayhim Ghayri Al-Maghdoobi ‘Alayhim Wa Laddaalleen (1:7)\r\n                            1:25:06\r\n                            Our teacher tonight is Apamea. And we are at verse...\r\n                            1:25:11\r\n                            What is the verse? Apamea: Only I don't wanna teach... The messenger: Yes.\r\n                            1:25:17\r\n                            The messenger: We are at verse number what? Apamea: 130 The messenger: Page 66. Verse 130.\r\n                            1:25:28\r\n                            Apamea: Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem.\r\n                            1:25:34\r\n                            أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ Apamea: Verse 130.\r\n                            1:25:40\r\n                            [3:130] O you who believe, you shall not take usury, compounded over and over. You shall observe GOD, that you may succeed.\r\n                            1:25:49\r\n                            [3:131] Beware of the hellfire that awaits the disbelievers. [3:132] You shall obey GOD and the messenger, that you may attain mercy.\r\n                            1:26:00\r\n                            I'll stop here. We have discussed in great detail about usury a few weeks ago.\r\n                            1:26:09\r\n                            But going back to one of the verses, chapter 2, verse 275.\r\n                            1:26:17\r\n                            There is a section about this. [2:275] Those who take usury are in the same position as those who are controlled by the devil. This is because they claim that usury is the same as trade. GOD has made trade lawful, and has made usury unlawful. Whoever heeds this commandment from his Lord, and refrains from usury, he may keep his past earnings, and his judgment rests with GOD. As for those who persist, they incur Hell, they abide therein forever.\r\n                            1:26:48\r\n                            This is exactly what God is telling us here. And we should realize what the difference is between trade and usury.\r\n                            1:26:54\r\n                            Where usury is lending money at excessive interest and taking advantage of the situation.\r\n                            1:26:59\r\n                            Especially in this section where God is teaching us about the war. It was war time.\r\n                            1:27:05\r\n                            We have talked about the battle of Badr last week. And some people, because of the economic situation, could very much take advantage of that.\r\n                            1:27:15\r\n                            And hurt others. And God teaches us that that is evil.\r\n                            1:27:21\r\n                            And the people who commit this wicked act, their place is in the hellfire and they are disbelievers.\r\n                            1:27:31\r\n                            And definitely this is given to us many times from God and the messenger confirms it.\r\n                            1:27:38\r\n                            And we should attain certainty about it and have... so that we can have mercy from God.\r\n                            1:27:51\r\n                            Do you have any comments? A man: I have a quick comment. A woman: He has a comment.\r\n                            1:27:56\r\n                            A man: The very concept of usury. Usury as a practice...\r\n                            \r\n                            13 Quran Study From Behrouz 313 Sura 7;12 By Rashad Adam & Eve's Body 12 24 1989\r\n                            \r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem The Test Begins.\r\n                            0:07\r\n                            [7:12] God said to Satan, \"What prevented you from prostrating when I ordered you?\" He said, \"I am better than he; You created me from fire, and created him from mud.\"\r\n                            0:24\r\n                            So, this verse obviously is after the rebellion, and after deciding to give the human being\r\n                            0:32\r\n                            a body, this body that's made from the earth's material, and giving Satan a body made from energy,\r\n                            0:40\r\n                            or made from fire, literally. If you go many, many years before that, Satan thought he can be a god beside God, and this\r\n                            0:54\r\n                            created the different opinions among God's creatures in God's kingdom, where the vast majority upheld God's absolute authority, and the tiny minority agreed with Satan to different degrees.\r\n                            1:08\r\n                            And after that, God decided to call Satan's bluff, and make him, give him a dominion and constituents.\r\n                            1:15\r\n                            Those who agreed with him are to become his constituents, and the planet Earth is to become his dominion.\r\n                            1:24\r\n                            And the plan called for, in fact, this was after putting all those creatures to death.\r\n                            1:32\r\n                            And then, this verse here has to do with telling the angels that they will serve the human beings\r\n                            1:45\r\n                            on this earth. They drive the wind, guarantee the provisions, guard them, serve them,\r\n                            1:52\r\n                            because they serve us. Angels serve us, even though we are the rebels, and they are the ones who upheld God's absolute authority, but they are participating in the plan that God is carrying out.\r\n                            2:04\r\n                            And this is exactly why we were talking about this last night, where they beat up the disbelievers at the end.\r\n                            2:13\r\n                            Because they served them with the hope that they will come back to God's kingdom.\r\n                            2:18\r\n                            They will redeem themselves. They will repent. They'll apologize for the mistake they committed.\r\n                            2:25\r\n                            But then, when the life comes to an end, and the person is a disbeliever, then they beat him up, because\r\n                            2:31\r\n                            they served him all this life, they provided him with all the means to redeem himself,\r\n                            2:39\r\n                            but then at the end he died as an unappreciative of God. So, we understand all this by looking at this verse.\r\n                            2:49\r\n                            So, \"what prevented you from prostrating\" means you are not cooperating, you are not participating\r\n                            3:00\r\n                            in serving the human being.\r\n                            3:06\r\n                            This may indicate also that Satan did not want to guarantee the happiness and welfare of any human being.\r\n                            3:14\r\n                            He wanted to keep his options open, because he is supposed to act as a god,\r\n                            3:22\r\n                            meaning, he is supposed to make everybody happy and wealthy and healthy and perfectly alright.\r\n                            3:29\r\n                            But he didn't want this guarantee. He wants to be free to punish whomever he wills, persecute whomever he wills, and help\r\n                            3:38\r\n                            whomever he wills. So, this is why he did not prostrate before the human being.\r\n                            3:49\r\n                            When God told him that he will be a temporary god, this meant that he was supposed to take care of his constituents and make them perfectly happy.\r\n                            3:55\r\n                            So, maybe he wanted some exit in case he cannot do it. \"oh, I'm just persecuting god.\"\r\n                            4:03\r\n                            But of course, his failure is glaring now. Number 13, [7:13] God said, \"Therefore, you must go down, for you are not to be arrogant here. Get out; you are debased.\"\r\n                            4:18\r\n                            So, this is a confirmation of his dismissal from God's kingdom. Number 14,\r\n                            4:26\r\n                            [7:14] Satan said, \"Grant me a respite, until the Day of Resurrection.\"\r\n                            4:33\r\n                            [7:15] God said, \"You are granted a respite.\" [7:16] He said, \"Since You have willed that I go astray,* I will skulk for them on Your straight path.\r\n                            4:54\r\n                            In this verse 16, Satan acknowledges that everything happens in accordance with God's will.\r\n                            5:00\r\n                            And it is God's will that we will, that we have a free choice. God willed that we will.\r\n                            5:07\r\n                            And that all His creatures will, because this rebellion indicates that God's creatures have freedom of choice.\r\n                            5:15\r\n                            In fact, the very first verse we read indicates that God's creatures can say \"no.\"\r\n                            5:24\r\n                            God said \"fall prostrate,\" and Satan said \"no, I will not.\" So, it indicates, if this did not happen, we would never know that God's creatures have freedom of choice.\r\n                            5:39\r\n                            So, Satan said, in number 16 here, [7:16] .....\"Since You have willed that I go astray,* I will skulk for them on Your straight path.\r\n                            5:46\r\n                            [7:17] \"I will come to them from their front, from their back, from their right, and from their left, and You will find that most of them are unappreciative.\"\r\n                            5:59\r\n                            Okay, 17, 7:17, remember this verse, because you will see it.\r\n                            6:06\r\n                            We experienced it, and we see it all around us, that Satan comes to the human being from\r\n                            6:11\r\n                            his front, back, right, and left, and never runs out of tricks to divert us.\r\n                            6:24\r\n                            This place right here is his number one target. Because people come here, and what do they come here for?\r\n                            6:31\r\n                            They come here to worship God alone, uphold the word of God alone. This is exactly what Satan does not want.\r\n                            6:37\r\n                            And he will put up all kinds of obstacles, and all kinds of tests, persecutions, in many, many different and strange ways.\r\n                            6:54\r\n                            It is good, because this guarantees that all God's people are solid believers.\r\n                            Satan wants to show “some humans are worse than Satan” example how people argue about Quranic letter counts.\r\n                            7:01\r\n                            They're unshakable, no matter what happens, or who says what.\r\n                            7:10\r\n                            [7:17] \"I will come to them from their front, and from their back, and from their right, and from their left, and You will find that most of them are unappreciative.\"\r\n                            7:18\r\n                            I think one of Satan's objectives is to show God that some humans are worse than he is, than Satan.\r\n                            7:26\r\n                            And it's true. Some humans out-satan Satan.\r\n                            7:33\r\n                            Satan is hoping that God may have mercy on him when He sees that some creatures are worse than he is.\r\n                            7:46\r\n                            I recall this fellow, when I was talking in Los Angeles, and this\r\n                            7:53\r\n                            professor at Chicago Seminary came out and gave a talk that the Quran is hallucinations by Muhammad.\r\n                            8:00\r\n                            And immediately after him, I gave a talk that the Quran could not be the word of human being. It has to be\r\n                            8:06\r\n                            the word of God, and here is the physical evidence. And I gave some details of the miracle, including the total of the numbers in the Quran.\r\n                            8:18\r\n                            When you take all the numbers mentioned in the Quran and add them up, the total is divisible by 19. So, these people from the American Islamic College in Chicago, also the same city,\r\n                            8:33\r\n                            they stood up and instead of attacking Dr. Hamilton, they attacked Rashad Khalifa. They attacked me.\r\n                            8:40\r\n                            The guy who said \"the Quran is hallucinations by Muhammad\" is okay. But the person who stood up to say \"the Quran is the word of God,\" they attacked me and they said\r\n                            8:51\r\n                            \"you didn't count the Shadda (geminate), Arrahman. There is a Shadda on the RA. You must count two RAs.\r\n                            8:57\r\n                            \"Muhammad (محمد) is five letters.\" Well, he had written before that, that Muhammad is five letters.\r\n                            9:06\r\n                            And I think his objective was because in the appendix 2 or I had published that if you add Ibrahim, Muhammad, and Rashad, the values of this and that, so they want to mess this up.\r\n                            9:17\r\n                            And he wants Muhammad (محمد) to be written Muhamamad (محممد). You know, two Ms. So, when he stood up and mentioned his name, I said \"oh, you're the fellow who thinks Muhammad should be five letters.\"\r\n                            9:27\r\n                            And even the Americans laughed, who are not Arabic speaking people. He said \"yes, if you put five coins on top of each other and you look at them, how many do you see?\"\r\n                            9:38\r\n                            The messenger: I said \"it depends on the angle.\" A man: It was very quiet, just hundreds. The messenger: Yeah.\r\n                            9:44\r\n                            A man: By the way, the sequence of talk was just, I mean, Dr. Hamilton was talking before Dr. Khalifa and nobody knew,\r\n                            9:56\r\n                            I mean, everyone was gonna talk about. He went and talked about\r\n                            10:03\r\n                            Quranic hallucinations of Muhammad, exactly before Rashad talked, and then Rashad went\r\n                            10:11\r\n                            immediately after him. I mean, who put that order? Dr. Khalifa: Who planned it this way? A man: And how many people were talking, that was three days seminar or something. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            10:19\r\n                            A man: It was three days and they put people at random. You know, they didn't organize it. It was not the chairman who organized it, they didn't even know who he was.\r\n                            10:28\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, they thought the, they thought the chairman of the session was me.\r\n                            10:34\r\n                            They were about to kill him, you know. Atif was there and Ihsan was there. A man: So, he finished all his games and just he was expecting everybody to be angry and mad and he gets Rashad.\r\n                            10:45\r\n                            And he throws his last coin and said \"oh, aren't you the one who's saying you are a messenger?\"\r\n                            10:51\r\n                            And he got up while everybody's sitting there, then he goes and said \"repeat.\" \"You gotta give me one\", you know. And he said \"yes.\" He did it. And you know, I think the guy was just,\r\n                            11:00\r\n                            you know, not getting for what he did. \"Oh, he was the one who's saying he's a messenger of God.\"\r\n                            11:06\r\n                            You know, I was just listening, and I'm sure the guy was shocked. He was expecting a revolution, a coup, and all that.\r\n                            11:16\r\n                            I think he finished all his arguments and no response from the audience, he said \"oh, you're the one who's saying you are a messenger.\r\n                            11:22\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: You're right. A man: He was looking for that. He was trying to get his point... Ihsan: But then he ran away, you remember, when he didn't see anything.\r\n                            11:30\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: He rushed out so fast, Ihsan thought he was going to get a gun or something and she got worried, and I said \"don't worry, Ihsan. I think the angels gave him a diarrhea or something.\" Because he rushed so fast.\r\n                            11:41\r\n                            Ihsan: I will never saw him, again. Dr. Khalifa: He rushed so fast, he had a blind man with him. of course they're all blind, but this one, also his eyes are blind, not just his heart.\r\n                            11:50\r\n                            And he was helping this blind man. He left his blind friend and ran, and never saw him again.\r\n                            11:58\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Rasool. A man: Some of the audience was very (unintelligible).\r\n                            12:05\r\n                            A man: Because every time (unintelligible) Rashad, (unintelligible) he did\r\n                            12:10\r\n                            If you look in the Quran, you count Qaf, for example, two halves are in the Quran (unintelligible).\r\n                            12:15\r\n                            So, you count them, let's say, 59. Khalifa counted 57,\r\n                            12:21\r\n                            You see in this way, let's say you're right. But he's also right. Now, Rashad Khalifa's 57 has a miracle with it. He counts 59, he has no miracle with it.\r\n                            12:30\r\n                            So, if you go really fair, if you count it Rashad's way, it's 57, if you wanna count it your way, you can count it your way.\r\n                            12:37\r\n                            A man: It doesn't come out... Dr. Khalifa: You have nothing. A man: There is no Qaf there to count. A man: I feel it was so fair, at least one of them found it. Dr. Khalifa: Yeah.\r\n                            12:45\r\n                            A man: Don't be upset, he counted that he was right, it was 57. And you wanna count it, he counted 59, but it...\r\n                            12:50\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, he said \"if you consider there are two methods of counting. One of them is what your eyes see, which is what Khalifa is suggesting.\r\n                            12:56\r\n                            And one is your way. If you wanna count the Shaddas as 2, fine. Go ahead and do it.\r\n                            13:02\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Because some... he looked Pakistani or Afghani or something, one of the professors.\r\n                            13:08\r\n                            Ihsan: I think he was Iranian. Dr. Khalifa: Could be. Ihsan: His accent was Iranian, he looked Iranian. Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, Anyway, so he said... it's like having two boxes, one is full of jewels, one is full of garbage. Open the one you like.\r\n                            13:20\r\n                            You open this box, there's lots of jewels. You open this one, there's a lot of garbage in here.\r\n                            13:29\r\n                            A man: (89:14) إِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَبِٱلْمِرْصَادِ Dr. Khalifa: So, this fellow is worse than Satan. He would out-Satan Satan. That's for sure.\r\n                            13:35\r\n                            I mean, what are we trying to say? We're trying to say \"the Quran is from God, and here is physical evidence.\" What is he trying to do? He's trying to destroy it.\r\n                            13:43\r\n                            Now, I mentioned the numbers specifically, because it has nothing to do with spelling. A man: Yeah.\r\n                            13:51\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, no, Edip's discovery of the Al-Fãtehah has nothing to do with spelling or writing. It was nothing.\r\n                            13:56\r\n                            Because sometimes they say \"oh, the Quran is oral.\" Well, it's right there, written.\r\n                            14:02\r\n                            One of their big things, I'm sure you heard that, they say \"the Quran is oral.\" Have you heard that argument? A man: Yeah, \"It was memorized.\"\r\n                            14:10\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, transmitted orally. A man: Orally, and then later on... Dr. Khalifa: Right, so I asked him \"what was the first word they were revealed in the Quran?\"\r\n                            14:20\r\n                            (96:1) ٱقْرَأْ Read. What is it, read lips? Even now, if they read lips, it's 19 times when you read Al-Fãtehah.\r\n                            14:31\r\n                            So, God is killing all the excuses. The first revelation... excuse me.\r\n                            14:37\r\n                            A man: It could be all of us. You can count them. A man: (unintelligible) to count them right. Dr. Khalifa: Yeah.\r\n                            14:43\r\n                            A man: But Edip's discovery is blown out. Dr. Khalifa: Right. A man: And I think it was probably because he was tampering because he was describing some (unintelligible)\r\n                            14:53\r\n                            one day, who will find more and more. Dr. Khalifa: The first revelation spoke about IQRA' and the pen. A man: Yeah.\r\n                            15:01\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: (96:4) ٱلَّذِى عَلَّمَ بِٱلْقَلَمِ He taught by means of the pen. Dr. Khalifa: So, what do you do with the pen? A man: Yeah.\r\n                            15:06\r\n                            (unintelligible). They have... and the second revelation was entitled the pen.\r\n                            15:15\r\n                            The first revelation is \"read\", and it had \"the pen\" in it. And the second revelation was the pen. Obviously, God knew they will say that.\r\n                            15:23\r\n                            So, they will do anything to destroy God's miracle. A man: They have a Hadith that says, \"read.\" \"I can't read.\" Dr. Khalifa: Right. Yes.\r\n                            15:34\r\n                            Ihsan: We found it in the Bible, by the way. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible) The Bible, the book of Isaiah.\r\n                            15:42\r\n                            It said \"the angel came to the unlearned man\" or something, \"and told him, read.\" \"He said I cannot read.\"\r\n                            15:49\r\n                            A man: Very strange. Dr. Khalifa: Very strange. A man: Book of Isaiah? Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Keikhusro found it. The Book of Isaiah. Ihsan: Yeah, I have a copy with that.\r\n                            15:56\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: It's exactly the story they gave us in Hadith. They probably took it from there.\r\n                            Hadith’s taken from Bible stories. Talk of out of body experience.\r\n                            16:03\r\n                            There were many things taken from the Bible. Ihsan: Yes, in a book of Hadith about Heaven having...\r\n                            16:10\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Like the Hadith about Heaven having, what, an eye never seen, and the ear never heard, and never imagined by a human being.\r\n                            16:17\r\n                            Word for word, I saw it in the Bible. Ihsan: Then, God said \"okay, go and study, come back.\"\r\n                            16:25\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Go learn how to read and write, and come back. 18\r\n                            16:32\r\n                            [7:18] God said, \"Get out therefrom, despised and defeated. Those among them who follow you, I will fill Hell with you all.\r\n                            16:40\r\n                            [7:19] \"As for you, Adam, dwell with your wife in Paradise, and eat therefrom as you please, but do not approach this one tree, lest you transgress.\"\r\n                            16:50\r\n                            Now, we know that all descriptions of Paradise or Heaven are allegorical.\r\n                            16:56\r\n                            So, \"do not approach this one tree\" is probably a law that God gave to Adam and Eve to uphold.\r\n                            17:02\r\n                            And the law is symbolized by the tree. But we learn from this, 19, 7:19, that Heaven exists.\r\n                            17:15\r\n                            It was created. Then, when God created the seven universes, and it still exists today, and the righteous go straight to it. They do not die.\r\n                            17:26\r\n                            20 [7:20] The devil whispered to them,.... Satan started to work on them.\r\n                            17:33\r\n                            [7:20] .....in order to reveal their bodies, which were invisible to them. He said, \"Your Lord did not forbid you from this tree, except to prevent you from becoming angels, and from attaining eternal existence.\"\r\n                            17:47\r\n                            So, one of the tricks of Satan is lying. He's a liar. This is a lie.\r\n                            17:56\r\n                            And this is why those who are fighting us are lying right and left.\r\n                            18:03\r\n                            It's God's law that they argue against the truth with falsehood.\r\n                            18:09\r\n                            In other words, they're following their teacher, Satan.\r\n                            18:26\r\n                            This is good. If you look at page 467, verse 5 says,\r\n                            18:35\r\n                            [40:5] Disbelieving before them were the people of Noah, and many parties after them. Every community attacked their messenger to neutralize him. And they argued with falsehood, to defeat the truth. Consequently, I punished them; how terrible was My retribution!\r\n                            19:01\r\n                            So, they're just following the steps of their master, Satan.\r\n                            19:08\r\n                            [7:20] The devil whispered to them, in order to reveal their bodies, which were invisible to them. He said, \"Your Lord did not forbid you from this tree, except to prevent you from becoming angels, and from attaining eternal existence.\"\r\n                            19:23\r\n                            So, what is the story of their bodies? Where were their bodies? They were down here on earth.\r\n                            19:29\r\n                            They were up in Heaven, and their bodies were here on earth. And this is something that happened to me personally, I'm passing on this information to all of us.\r\n                            19:40\r\n                            But apparently it happened often. It happened when the Prophet Muhammad was taken to receive the Quran,\r\n                            19:48\r\n                            He was taken to a different place, which is even farther than Paradise, but he also visited Paradise.\r\n                            19:56\r\n                            We see this in Sura 53:17, 18.\r\n                            20:04\r\n                            17 where he saw the tree that Adam and Eve ate from.\r\n                            20:17\r\n                            It happened to Ihsan. This definitely happened to you when you were fired from your work.\r\n                            20:26\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Do you know the story of Ihsan? A woman: No. Dr. Khalifa: She was working, she was talking to Aunt Margaret in Sweden on the telephone.\r\n                            20:35\r\n                            And all of a sudden, people came in, they saw her incoherent.\r\n                            20:45\r\n                            So, they took her to the hospital. They called her children. Both of them are doctors, and of course they're thinking in terms of this world, what was it, a stroke? Is it a heart attack? Is it....?\r\n                            20:56\r\n                            But she was like she's not here. She was walking. She walked with them, went to the hospital.\r\n                            21:02\r\n                            Meanwhile, she... what did you see? You saw a gathering of a lot of people, and a tall, huge figure that she understood to be Abraham.\r\n                            21:16\r\n                            This is interesting because the only prophet who was identified to me was Abraham, also.\r\n                            21:23\r\n                            And when she came to, she was in the hospital, and she.... now take it from there. What did you see?\r\n                            21:30\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: What happened? Ihsan: I think it's a confirmation for us, because, no, because then when I told him that, then he told me about it.\r\n                            21:39\r\n                            They were taking me now where there were all the prophets and (unintelligible).\r\n                            21:45\r\n                            Ihsan: And Behrouz also saw the same big figure. Dr. Khalifa: But that's....\r\n                            21:52\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: We always have confirmation, Alhamdu Lillah. This coming Friday, Behrouz will give the Khutbah, and he will tell us about confirmation of how the revelation comes.\r\n                            22:02\r\n                            That's another issue. But when you came, in the hospital, you opened your eyes and you were in the hospital. Then what was the first... your first question was what?\r\n                            22:10\r\n                            Ihsan: I never told.... I was talking to them. I talked to my daughter, called her on the phone. I was in the....\r\n                            22:17\r\n                            She told me that I told her.... Dr. Khalifa: No, you didn't call her on the phone. You gave the phone number to somebody and they called her. Ihsan: Yeah, but they called, they put put me on the phone. I (unintelligible)\r\n                            22:25\r\n                            They couldn't even write anything, sign anything. They have no idea what I was in there at all.\r\n                            22:31\r\n                            My body was there. I was talking, but at the same time I was somewhere else like, My soul was somewhere else.\r\n                            22:38\r\n                            And I saw a gathering of all, it seems like they are all prophets and messengers, I think.\r\n                            22:46\r\n                            I could see their faces. They were taking someone that was huge, and very tall, and very proportionate, like the statue of liberty, or maybe more.\r\n                            22:58\r\n                            And they were all saying five words, almost the same, clothes, and poems, or fashion.\r\n                            23:07\r\n                            Everyone, I mean, always, and he was back, but I knew that he was talking to them.\r\n                            23:15\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: But they were not prophets, Ihsan. You said they were just people, millions of them. Ihsan: Yeah. A lot of people, but he was the one speaking. I think now that maybe they are.\r\n                            23:26\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: There aren't, there aren't that many messengers. Ihsan: They were like a square, (unintelligible). And the guy came, and he was talking to them.\r\n                            23:39\r\n                            And I was, and to me at the same time, I was talking to (unintelligible)\r\n                            23:49\r\n                            I didn't see my parents, but I was... yeah.\r\n                            23:55\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: What was the first question when you came to in the hospital? I just wanna say what, how the bodies on earth feeling.\r\n                            24:02\r\n                            Ihsan: (unintelligible) Ihsan: (unintelligible) \"You killed us\" \"you're killing me.\"\r\n                            24:09\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: He scared us to death. Ihsan: They were all crying. I have...\r\n                            24:15\r\n                            \"I don't know. Why am I...? What is this? Who's sick?\"\r\n                            24:21\r\n                            He said \"there's one in hospital, there\" Dr. Khalifa: \"Why am I in the hospital?\" Ihsan: Yeah, I don't know what it was.\r\n                            24:28\r\n                            There were two things happened at the same time, something with me and something on the earth.\r\n                            24:35\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: So, you were talking to Anne Margaret on the telephone. Ihsan: Yeah. Dr. Khalifa: Next thing you know, you're in the hospital. Ihsan: Yeah. So, you told them \"what is going on? Why am I in the hospital? What's happening?\" What did they say?\r\n                            24:45\r\n                            Ihsan: They said that I was... that \"they were called and they talked to them\" they said. And they put me in the car and took me to the hospital.\r\n                            24:55\r\n                            I mean \"what's happened? what's happened? (unintelligible)\"\r\n                            25:01\r\n                            I said .... I told something to my son but he was not quite awake yet.\r\n                            25:06\r\n                            (unintelligible)\r\n                            25:15\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Did you get scared? Did you get scared? Ihsan: Yeah. Ihsan: I didn't know what was going on. I had to call everybody and tell them \"I'm not...What did they tell you the last thing?\"\r\n                            25:24\r\n                            She said \"I have to go. I have to go.\" I have to go enjoy, but I had already prayed.\r\n                            25:29\r\n                            (unintelligible) I said \"I didn't have to....\" (unintelligible).\r\n                            25:36\r\n                            We were talking to three people. She said \"we were crying, crying, crying, crying and you said \"I have to go.\"\r\n                            25:46\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Ok. There was some example of having good formation of having the body here and the soul somewhere else, wherever that is.\r\n                            25:54\r\n                            A man: So, when the God asked the Satan to prostrate, He's basically saying \"prostrate with just the body, not the soul.\" Dr. Khalifa: Right.\r\n                            26:07\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: This is the idea of prostrating to the human being. (Unintelligible).\r\n                            26:16\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Well, the plan was clear to everybody and so.... because from this, the information that God gave us, everybody knew what the plan was.\r\n                            26:30\r\n                            A man: And what was the plan? Dr. Khalifa: That all the rebels are put to death and will be brought to this world and the angels will serve them\r\n                            26:40\r\n                            and guard them and then after the test is over, everybody will be either redeemed to God's kingdom or sent to Hell.\r\n                            26:50\r\n                            A man: If it was the plan, Satan was also part of the plan and then as he said \"God willed him to be like this\", so he's really innocent.\r\n                            27:00\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: He's what? A man: He's really innocent. God willed him.... Dr. Khalifa: Yes, he's trying to blame it on God.\r\n                            27:06\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: But God gave him the freedom to choose. Because everything ultimately is in accordance with God's will.\r\n                            27:16\r\n                            In other words, he's telling God \"You could have made me obedient.\" God doesn't want robots.\r\n                            27:23\r\n                            And it's not up to Satan to decide that. And we know the law that God does not inflict an atom's worth of injustice.\r\n                            27:39\r\n                            So, as God is revealing more and more of His information and we're understanding the total picture\r\n                            27:45\r\n                            more and more, but what in 20, \"the devil whispered to them in order to reveal their bodies\"\r\n                            27:52\r\n                            because their bodies were down on earth and he wanted them to get out, get evicted from Heaven and go down to their bodies which actually happened.\r\n                            Debate on location of Adam and Eve’s body.\r\n                            28:02\r\n                            The minute they broke God's law, they were sucked into their bodies down here on earth.\r\n                            28:10\r\n                            Also at the beginning of the plan, since Adam and Eve didn't do anything wrong under the new circumstances,\r\n                            28:17\r\n                            they deserved to be in Heaven until they committed disobedience.\r\n                            28:24\r\n                            In other words, they listened to Satan. Therefore, they belonged in his kingdom which was prepared down on earth.\r\n                            28:30\r\n                            As long as they listened to God, they were in Heaven. The minute they listened to Satan and ate from the tree, they went down to Satan's kingdom.\r\n                            28:39\r\n                            A man: Also, their bodies (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Yeah.\r\n                            28:47\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: That's a good point.\r\n                            28:57\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: That's a good point. Let's see, [7:21] He swore to them, \"I am giving you good advice.\"\r\n                            29:05\r\n                            which is a lie. [7:22] He thus duped them with lies. As soon as they tasted the tree, their bodies became visible to them, and they tried to cover themselves with the leaves of Paradise....\r\n                            29:18\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible).\r\n                            29:25\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, of course, there were gardens here on earth as well, but we have to,\r\n                            29:30\r\n                            we have to look at this (7:22) وَرَقِ ٱلْجَنَّةِ the expression in Arabic is ٱلْجَنَّةِ which is the same expression where they were.\r\n                            29:40\r\n                            (unintelligible).\r\n                            29:51\r\n                            Yeah, maybe their bodies were up there in Heaven not down on earth. Ihsan: But also جَنَّةِ was mentioned for garden.\r\n                            30:00\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, but see, the word that's the same word that is used. Yeah.\r\n                            30:05\r\n                            ٱلْجَنَّةِ The Jannah, the Paradise.\r\n                            30:13\r\n                            Also,... (unintelligible).\r\n                            30:19\r\n                            Go down there from. Just that the way I have it in the movie script that I wrote that God sent the angels to bring a couple hundred pounds of\r\n                            30:31\r\n                            of mud from the planet earth and took it up there. And who was asking about falling prostrate before the body, (unintelligible)?\r\n                            30:45\r\n                            So, this had to be up there. A man: Yes, the body must be up there because after this, God says \"go down on the earth.\r\n                            30:52\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: This, Ihsan just said in Arabic, yeah. So,... A man: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            31:00\r\n                            A man: But no, actually, (unintelligible). A woman: If the prostration happened in the Heaven, then they can go down.\r\n                            31:11\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Then, we shouldn't put physical limitations on the body going up there or coming down here. If God wants to\r\n                            31:18\r\n                            move the bodies from the earth to Heaven, He'll do that.\r\n                            31:23\r\n                            So, we have to just keep this, reconsider this the position of the bodies whether they are down here on earth or up there in Heaven.\r\n                            31:31\r\n                            But this is a good point, Asif, that covering their bodies with the leaves of Paradise.\r\n                            31:38\r\n                            A man: Would the Arabic word for body have a different meaning or is it very specific?\r\n                            31:44\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, it's very specific here. This word is used in a few places like when Adam's sons, one killed the other one, they said \"bury the body.\"\r\n                            31:53\r\n                            It's the same word. A man: They mistranslated this one. Dr. Khalifa: سَوْءَٰتی Dr. Khalifa: Hmm? A man: Other Tafsirs translated this..., other Tafsirs.\r\n                            32:01\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: What did they say? A man: They said here (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Oh.\r\n                            32:16\r\n                            (unintelligible).\r\n                            32:23\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Okay, in 24 it says \"go down as enemies of one another.\" It says \"go down.\" So,\r\n                            32:30\r\n                            obviously this is after the... after they saw their bodies.\r\n                            32:37\r\n                            So, this is shaping up as having the bodies up there. Then, maybe my movie script is correct.\r\n                            32:48\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: IN SHAA ALLAH.\r\n                            33:02\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, it's good. Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible). The word is (unintelligible). A man: (unintelligible) soul. body. When the body... Dr. Khalifa: Yeah.\r\n                            33:16\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, but the body was invisible to them. Their bodies were invisible meaning they were in a different dimension.\r\n                            33:24\r\n                            It's like we don't see the angels or the jinns now who are right here with us. But they are in different dimension.\r\n                            33:30\r\n                            A man: You know, when God created Adam, (unintelligible).\r\n                            33:35\r\n                            When He (unintelligible) Adam, you know. Well, Subhan Allah (unintelligible) body. So, when He told angels \"I'm creating...\"\r\n                            33:46\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: A human from clay. A man: (unintelligible) He makes the body from the mud\r\n                            33:54\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah. Now I'm... looking at this that they cover themselves with leaves of Paradise is very significant\r\n                            34:01\r\n                            and then followed by \"go down as enemies.\" So, go down after seeing their bodies means their bodies are up there.\r\n                            34:08\r\n                            A woman: Isn't that like when we go to the space, we don't feel our weight but we have the weight?\r\n                            34:15\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, but see the body has to be protected somehow. Of course, God will do that. A woman: I mean they had the body but they didn't know that. I mean, they couldn't...\r\n                            34:24\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: They couldn't see them. Yes. Their bodies were invisible to them. This is... A man: Also, when you were taken up, something you saw the other prophets, you know, their bodies...\r\n                            34:36\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yes, they looked like the way they looked here on earth. Edip: Rashad, the Arabic expression\r\n                            34:43\r\n                            لِيُبْدِىَ لَهُمَا مَا وُۥرِىَ عَنْهُمَا مِن سَوْءَٰتِهِمَا وَقَالَ مَا نَهَىٰكُمَا (7:20) رَبُّكُمَا\r\n                            34:54\r\n                            Edip: Their bodies. Maybe, part of their bodies, that's why they see their bodies.\r\n                            35:01\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, that's because.... Edip: ‌Because there's a reason (unintelligible).\r\n                            35:06\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible) (7:20) لِيُبْدِىَ لَهُمَا مَا وُۥرِىَ عَنْهُمَا A man: Some parts was, you are aware of how the.... some parts you are aware of.\r\n                            35:17\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yes, what you're thinking, yes. No, it... A man: (unintelligible).\r\n                            35:25\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, because when you go back let's see... Dr. Khalifa: (7:22) بَدَتْ لَهُمَا سَوْءَٰتُهُمَا\r\n                            35:31\r\n                            didn't say: بَدَتْ لَهُمَا مَا وُۥرِىَ سَوْءَٰتُهُمَا مَا وُۥرِىَ means the body was invisible. The whole body was invisible.\r\n                            35:40\r\n                            Because if you look, if you look at what's the verse number here?\r\n                            35:46\r\n                            27, 22 excuse me, 22 says \"their bodies became visible to them.\"\r\n                            35:53\r\n                            (7:22) بَدَتْ لَهُمَا سَوْءَٰتُهُمَا Edip: Oh, yes. The thing means... Dr. Khalifa: But مَا وُۥرِىَ does not imply a part of the body.\r\n                            36:03\r\n                            Edip: (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Right. So, their bodies, their whole bodies were invisible to them. They were in a different dimension and we're talking about souls.\r\n                            36:15\r\n                            Until they ate from the tree or until they broke God's law, then their bodies became visible to them.\r\n                            36:20\r\n                            They moved to another dimension. In this dimension, they can see us, we cannot see them.\r\n                            36:33\r\n                            A man: Who's them? Dr. Khalifa: Angels, jinns, God.\r\n                            36:42\r\n                            It's in another dimension. But it's interesting that they could not see their bodies.\r\n                            36:49\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible).\r\n                            36:55\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Their bodies were far from them. A man: I just wanna (unintelligible) for the body (unintelligible).\r\n                            37:05\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Ecstasy. A man: Yeah, ecstasy. (unintelligible)\r\n                            37:11\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: You know, we're in this dimension, if we have out-of-body experience, we'll see the body.\r\n                            37:16\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible)\r\n                            37:21\r\n                            A woman: Is it actually invisible or (unintelligible)? Dr. Khalifa: No, hidden from you. The word is hidden.\r\n                            37:33\r\n                            A man: Some interpretations, they say the eating the apple (unintelligible). Allegorical.\r\n                            37:48\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, they knew that Satan lied to them. That's for sure. Edip: Yes, (unintelligible).\r\n                            37:59\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: I would leave the location of the bodies hanging until God... Maybe, God will want us to know exactly where their bodies were, but\r\n                            38:10\r\n                            it seems like they were up there, but maybe in a different location up there. A woman: If it wasn't there, we wouldn't have the \"invisible.\" When it says \"invisible\", it should be there.\r\n                            38:22\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah. A woman: It's like I have a hat. When I wear my hat, I'm invisible.\r\n                            38:27\r\n                            When I'm invisible, it doesn't mean I'm not here. I am here, but I am invisible. Dr. Khalifa: Well, it could be anywhere, but the fact that they cover themselves leaves of Paradise and after that God is telling them, in 24, \"go down\",\r\n                            38:42\r\n                            this means it happened, it all happened upstairs. Alhamdu Lillah.\r\n                            38:48\r\n                            A man: One more question. We're created from mud...\r\n                            38:55\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: and water. A man: (unintelligible) Adam\r\n                            39:06\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: \"because You created him from mud.\" like I said, the God's plan was already known.\r\n                            39:11\r\n                            So, God said \"I will give him bodies made of clay. I will give you bodies made of fire.\"\r\n                            39:18\r\n                            So, they knew that difference. A man: (unintelligible).\r\n                            39:28\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Before that, we were all creatures of God and I'm sure we were of different ranks\r\n                            39:34\r\n                            or jobs, put it this way, responsibilities, different degrees of...\r\n                            39:41\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible).\r\n                            39:50\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: God created the heavens and the earth. The whole earth was new, came from nothing and so did the human bodies.\r\n                            39:57\r\n                            Even the souls were created. (39:62) ٱللَّهُ خَـٰلِقُ كُلِّ شَىْءٍۢ God is the Creator of all things.\r\n                            40:04\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible). creating Adam\r\n                            40:21\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Say it again. Say the question again. A man: The souls were there, souls of Adam and Eve were there...\r\n                            40:27\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Oh, yeah. Definitely. Because God gathered all, all of us and had us witness Him as our Load and Master.\r\n                            40:37\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: God assigns... Let's think of a human being being born right now. God takes one of the souls\r\n                            40:47\r\n                            that have been put to death and assigns it to that body.\r\n                            40:52\r\n                            So, the process is happening now. It happened then except Adam and Eve had to be... Adam had to be created initially.\r\n                            41:01\r\n                            And then after that is the human reproduction and baby that is born gets a soul assigned to him or her. Obviously, God wanted this story to\r\n                            41:15\r\n                            the details to be revealed over a long period of time. Every piece of it is timed.\r\n                            41:22\r\n                            And usually God puts the details in such a way that it will give to every generation a satisfactory explanation.\r\n                            41:31\r\n                            A woman: (unintelligible).\r\n                            41:38\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: [7:27] O children of Adam, do not let the devil entice you as he did when he evicted your parents from Paradise. He removed their garments to expose their bodies. He and his tribe see you, while you do not see them. We appoint the devils as companions for those who do not believe.\r\n                            41:56\r\n                            What do you understand, Cecilia, from this? Cecilia: (unintelligible).\r\n                            42:09\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Well, the government of righteousness, remember? Cecilia: And so the government of righteousness (unintelligible).\r\n                            42:29\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Well, let's read... yeah, go ahead. A man: I was reading in the book a few years ago and this reminds me in that book,\r\n                            42:41\r\n                            it was going to explain how our physical body in this three dimensional world is actually that\r\n                            42:51\r\n                            quality or the lowly part of all qualities when we are saying, when we are attached with this\r\n                            43:01\r\n                            three dimensional world like a person in the ocean that he wants to swim and talk and have some oxygen,\r\n                            43:09\r\n                            I mean like a person that is like a big (unintelligible).\r\n                            43:17\r\n                            Now we're saying that we were in Paradise and we were like a soul.\r\n                            43:24\r\n                            And as soon as we disobey God's law and we eat from that tree, right there, as a punishment of that work\r\n                            43:37\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: That's a good simulation. A man: Their body was\r\n                            43:45\r\n                            A man: ...exposed, our body, as if it was something that made trouble for us and as a punishment appeared with us and\r\n                            43:55\r\n                            we became a physical being instead of a soul.\r\n                            44:02\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Well, I think let's, just for the, it will be, I think, sufficient for us. Maybe, this is what God wants us to know at this time is that they were out of their bodies.\r\n                            44:13\r\n                            Their bodies weren't visible to them. They were in Heaven. Everything was perfect.\r\n                            44:18\r\n                            The minute they broke God's law, they were back into their bodies. Then, their bodies became visible just like as we are now.\r\n                            44:27\r\n                            But before this happens, until they broke God's law, they were free, they were in Heaven. Because the body is not anything really, so...\r\n                            44:37\r\n                            like when the righteous go to Heaven, what happens? They leave their bodies and they go to Heaven. And Heaven is fantastic. They're having a lot of fun.\r\n                            44:47\r\n                            So, this is the way Adam and Eve were. When they broke God's law, they were trapped into their bodies.\r\n                            44:56\r\n                            And then their bodies became visible to them. Now, what we were not sure about was where exactly were their bodies\r\n                            45:05\r\n                            that were not visible to them. We didn't pay attention to that. Edip: Rashad, this Paradise, Heaven may be changed to earth at that time because...\r\n                            45:19\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, no, no, there's no possibility of that because people go to Heaven now. So, where do they go?\r\n                            45:26\r\n                            Edip: There are many Paradises now. Dr. Khalifa: No, it's Al-Jannah. It was one Jannah that Adam and Eve went to.\r\n                            45:40\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: There's no Jannah on earth. I can tell you that. Edip: There's one another question that always I wonder.\r\n                            45:50\r\n                            What is the answer to this? What is the existence of Adam? The existence of Adam starts from creation of\r\n                            46:04\r\n                            (unintelligible) or before that.\r\n                            46:10\r\n                            God doesn't mention the first creation before Adam.\r\n                            46:15\r\n                            Edip: Because our first understanding is that... Dr. Khalifa: 172 in this same Sura\r\n                            46:25\r\n                            [7:172] ....They all said, \"Yes. We bear witness.\" Thus, you cannot say on the Day of Resurrection, \"We were not aware of this.\"\r\n                            46:32\r\n                            When did this happen?\r\n                            46:37\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, Edip. When did this happen? 172.\r\n                            46:52\r\n                            Edip: It's not the creation of Adam. Dr. Khalifa: No, it couldn't be.\r\n                            46:59\r\n                            See, at the creation of the body of Adam, the clay body of Adam, all the humans were dead. They were already put to death as we see in Sura 67.\r\n                            Explains why God created death and the REAL LOCATION of the body – the issue is settled.\r\n                            47:10\r\n                            Ok. We have, we have to put the pieces together. Now, Let's look at 67, page 562 verse 2.\r\n                            47:31\r\n                            [67:2] The One who created death and life for the purpose of distinguishing those among you who would do better.*\r\n                            47:39\r\n                            So, God created death. Now, the way I see it now, understand it now, is\r\n                            47:48\r\n                            when we rebelled against God, God put us all to death, the first death, remember?\r\n                            47:57\r\n                            Two deaths for the unrighteous, one death for the righteous. We were all put to death with the stipulation that we'll be brought into this life at the specified time\r\n                            48:06\r\n                            and given the chance to redeem ourselves. So, when you go back here to 172, God says He summoned all the human race before Him.\r\n                            48:18\r\n                            Obviously, they were not dead yet. And He told them \"am I not your Lord? And we all bore witness that He is our Lord.\r\n                            48:27\r\n                            So, these are some of the things that happened before the creation of Adam's body.\r\n                            48:36\r\n                            And Adam was included in this 172. He was just one of the human beings.\r\n                            48:41\r\n                            So after this was done, and the natural instinct of worshipping God alone was put in us, we were all put to death,\r\n                            48:49\r\n                            and then the plan, the execution of the plan started. God created the body of Adam from clay, told the angels \"fall prostrate before this body. You're gonna serve.\"\r\n                            48:59\r\n                            And then, God assigned one of the humans, who happens to be Adam, to this body.\r\n                            49:04\r\n                            Then, Eve was assigned to the clone. God cloned a body from Adam's body,\r\n                            49:11\r\n                            and assigned the second human being, Eve, to that body, and then told them... you know the rest of the story.\r\n                            49:19\r\n                            Edip: There's a word that's confused, Rashad. There's a word \"creation.\" \"Creation\", I don't know.\r\n                            49:25\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, I said \"create the body.\" Edip: Right. Yes. Edip: But when we translate in Turkish, \"creation\" means just from nothing, just create. The creation of Adam starts from this... Dr. Khalifa: Right. Right.\r\n                            49:39\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, remember the body, create the body of Adam. But before the creation of the body of Adam, Adam existed.\r\n                            49:45\r\n                            Edip: I think it's not a form of Adam, because KHALAQA... Dr. Khalifa: No, the creation of body, the creation of Adam's body, yes.\r\n                            49:54\r\n                            Creation of Adam's body, I'm very careful with this, because before the creation of Adam's body, Adam existed.\r\n                            50:01\r\n                            If you wanna go back to the very beginning, God created Adam, and you and me, and every other creature, initially.\r\n                            50:08\r\n                            And we were all wonderful in God's kingdom until the great feud happened.\r\n                            50:14\r\n                            Edip: Now, I found an answer to this question. Dr. Khalifa: Let's have it.\r\n                            50:20\r\n                            Edip: Adam didn't exist before the expression would be in this way, God created the creatures, and then named him Adam.\r\n                            50:29\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Right, there you go. There you go. Yes. Edip: I think this is it.\r\n                            50:34\r\n                            So, when we put all these pieces together, it's obvious that God created all the creatures.\r\n                            50:40\r\n                            They were all in His kingdom. Everything was going nicely, until the feud happened. The feud happened when Satan had these ideas, and then the creatures had different opinions,\r\n                            50:52\r\n                            the vast majority upholding God's absolute authority, a small minority agreeing with Satan.\r\n                            50:59\r\n                            And then, this small minority was given another chance to submit.\r\n                            51:05\r\n                            The animals and the stars and the trees submitted, but the humans continued to defy God and agree with Satan.\r\n                            51:17\r\n                            And then the creation or the execution of the plan, which is, we're all familiar with now.\r\n                            51:25\r\n                            I think the location of the bodies, obviously is not relevant, where the bodies were.\r\n                            51:35\r\n                            The point is they were invisible to them until they broke God's law. Then, they were sucked into their bodies and sent down here to Earth to start the test.\r\n                            51:45\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yes. A man: (unintelligible).\r\n                            51:50\r\n                            A man: The second goal is the idea that the souls are hurled into the body, that each body,\r\n                            51:59\r\n                            each soul has its identified body, and it's put into it because of what it has done. Dr. Khalifa: Right. Yes.\r\n                            52:07\r\n                            A man: (Unintelligible) A man: And their Lord called down to them, you know, and said that they had not followed what He said,\r\n                            52:20\r\n                            (unintelligible) from that tree, and warned them that the devil is their most ardent enemy.\r\n                            52:25\r\n                            That was just to let us understand that each body, that the bodies, souls are assigned to their bodies, their physical bodies, and we have (unintelligible) to the souls.\r\n                            52:35\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: What is the first thing we do when we come to this world? Dr. Khalifa: Right.\r\n                            52:41\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: The soul is assigned to the body, and the first thing we do \"oh, no!\" And on top of that you get a spank.\r\n                            52:52\r\n                            Everywhere, they cry. A man: I think that's what she's saying, I think (unintelligible) just threw me out of the body, and there (unintelligible).\r\n                            53:01\r\n                            So, that's why she doesn't see, at the minute, she (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: It doesn't matter. Yes.\r\n                            53:08\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Yes. A man: (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            53:16\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: What happens? Yes. A man: (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Exactly\r\n                            53:29\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah. That's why I asked you, what was the first thing you asked when you came back?\r\n                            53:35\r\n                            \"What is happening? Why am I here? Why are you here? What are you doing here? What happened?\"\r\n                            53:40\r\n                            Ihsan: I couldn't have done anything with my body. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Ihsan: She said the police stopped her because she didn't know how to put the lights on in the car\r\n                            53:48\r\n                            and help her to go to the hospital, and I had no idea. I was sitting in the back of the car and I had no idea what was going on.\r\n                            53:55\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Did he tell her, why don't you turn the lights on? The police told her (unintelligible).\r\n                            Talk of out of body experience.\r\n                            54:00\r\n                            Atif: (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Right.\r\n                            54:19\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Wait a minute. Slow down. Slow down. Because this is wonderful, also. I forget that Atif has all these experiences.\r\n                            54:25\r\n                            He's telling about somebody who had an out-of-body experience. And they were operating on the person?\r\n                            54:30\r\n                            Atif: They were having some dental work on his teeth. Dr. Khalifa: Oh, dental work. Ok. Go ahead.\r\n                            54:35\r\n                            Atif: He didn't know. All the work on his teeth is when he got out of his body. His mother was sitting out in the waiting room.\r\n                            54:42\r\n                            And as soon as he got out, you know, \"the guy doesn't move, doesn't talk, doesn't do nothing.\"\r\n                            54:48\r\n                            So, they called for (unintelligible) an emergency.\r\n                            54:53\r\n                            And they got the team and they started pumping his chest and giving him fluids. Dr. Khalifa: And he was watching.\r\n                            54:59\r\n                            Atif: And they were rolling around having fun watching him. And these kids (unintelligible) about to die.\r\n                            55:06\r\n                            You just think \"usually people don't die in the dental office.\r\n                            55:12\r\n                            But the doctor was so nervous. (unintelligible) He went outside in the waiting room\r\n                            55:20\r\n                            And his mother was sitting there. And he lifted the bottle in his hand, giving him fluids, trying to get him back. And he went there (unintelligible).\r\n                            55:27\r\n                            I went there. And then I went by my mother. I (unintelligible) her left shoulder. I'm looking. That's not the way you say it. (unintelligible).\r\n                            55:35\r\n                            I looked in the (unintelligible) magazine. Actually, I wanted to see what she was reading. And then after a while, I decided to go back.\r\n                            55:42\r\n                            So, I went back. (unintelligible) I went back to his body. So, he revived. So, the doctor and the nurse got him back. They never got him back. He was just outside.\r\n                            55:52\r\n                            And after he finished, he went to his mother. And of course, after they got him back, the doctor went to his mother and said \"oh, we're so sorry your son\r\n                            56:01\r\n                            was in a different room. We almost lost him. But we worked hard and got him back.\r\n                            56:06\r\n                            And we're so happy. And, you know, before what happened, so after his mother took him back, he told her, you know\r\n                            56:14\r\n                            \"all this stuff happened. I was out of my body. I was just roaming around.\" Of course, she's happy. \"What are you talking about?\"\r\n                            56:19\r\n                            You know, I told her \"yeah, I was out. You were sitting in the chair by the window. I was right here on your shoulder.\"\r\n                            56:25\r\n                            \"And you were looking at the magazine.\" She said \"yes.\" \"And you were reading an article about so and so.\" She said \"yes. How did you know that?\"\r\n                            56:31\r\n                            \"Because I was out there. I was looking at you.\" So, I said \"you know, the time was out.\"\r\n                            56:36\r\n                            He didn't care about what they were doing to. his body. He put needles on him. They beat him up. Atif: He was having fun. He was having fun. Dr. Khalifa: Exactly.\r\n                            56:44\r\n                            I was thinking, you know, it could be like you said. Adam had been outside having so much fun in Paradise, my God.\r\n                            56:49\r\n                            He didn't care about small things (unintelligible).\r\n                            56:55\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Besides, he had never seen his body before that. Atif: Yeah, that's another thing. That was a shock. Dr. Khalifa: Yeah.\r\n                            Talk of Jesus and crucification.\r\n                            57:00\r\n                            A woman: Rashad, (unintelligible).\r\n                            57:06\r\n                            A woman: had no record or impression of the needles, the pain, and whatever. Dr. Khalifa: There's no pain.\r\n                            57:13\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: There's no pain. A woman: When he goes back in, he has no record of... Dr. Khalifa: Actually, this tells us exactly what Jesus felt when they crucified him.\r\n                            57:20\r\n                            A woman: That's what I was thinking. No,... Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: Because Jesus was gone. This is, I mean, God is... look how God is teaching us. A woman: Right.\r\n                            57:27\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Real life experiences. This is a physical scientist, a surgeon, you know. He's not spiritual.\r\n                            57:33\r\n                            He's also very spiritual. Yeah. I don't mean it that way. But, I mean, he's a scientist. He's very critical. (unintelligible).\r\n                            57:42\r\n                            God is teaching us by... There's a book, of course, that puts all these stories in one book, about out-of-body experiences. Some of you may have seen the book.\r\n                            57:51\r\n                            There are many people who doctors are operating on, and they say exactly the same thing. They watch the doctors operating their bodies, and then they decide to go back.\r\n                            58:00\r\n                            Of course, that's not death. I mean, obviously, this fellow was destined to live beyond that point.\r\n                            58:07\r\n                            But God is teaching us, telling us exactly what the deal is. And this is what we're reading here.\r\n                            58:12\r\n                            Adam and Eve were out of their bodies. They were having fun in Paradise. When they disobeyed God's law, they came to this body, which tells us\r\n                            58:20\r\n                            this is how you go to Satan's kingdom. Since you listened to Satan, you didn't listen to God, you belong in Satan's kingdom. So, goodbye.\r\n                            58:27\r\n                            Which we see in 26. 24,\r\n                            58:33\r\n                            [7:24] He said, \"Go down as enemies of one another. On earth shall be your habitation and provision for awhile.\"\r\n                            58:40\r\n                            Which is undergoing the (unintelligible). A woman: (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: I think, yes, we have a very clear picture, with a few little details that God didn't let us know yet,\r\n                            58:53\r\n                            and are not relevant to our generation anyway. A man: Can I ask you a question? Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, go ahead. You've been very quiet.\r\n                            58:58\r\n                            A man: At the time of the feud, all those, all the rebels were put to death? Dr. Khalifa: Rebels.\r\n                            59:10\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Not at the time of the feud. There are certain things that happened after that, including this bearing witness that God is our Lord and Master, putting a certain instinct in us.\r\n                            59:20\r\n                            And you notice, and go look carefully again at 172, this same Sura.\r\n                            59:34\r\n                            It says [7:172] Recall that your Lord summoned all the descendants of Adam... So, God had only the human race bear witness that He is Lord and Master, but not the jinns.\r\n                            59:46\r\n                            See, your companion represents Satan's point of view. Your companion will never tell you to do the Noon Prayer, or to worship God alone.\r\n                            59:54\r\n                            Your companion will do the exact opposite. So, but God gave us the nice instinct of knowing about God, knowing that He alone is our Lord and Master.\r\n                            1:00:05\r\n                            The jinns were the half of the creatures who were closest to Satan's point of view.\r\n                            1:00:11\r\n                            And they're being assigned to us. A man: When was the time that Satan was exposed?\r\n                            1:00:16\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: You mean as a rebel? A man: As a rebel. Dr. Khalifa: This is in 38:69.\r\n                            1:00:24\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: This is the very beginning. This triggered the whole thing. 38:69 is in page 457.\r\n                            1:00:37\r\n                            It says, [38:69] \"I did not possess any knowledge about the feud in the High Society. And you notice after this, again, we're told the story of Satan, eating from the tree.\r\n                            1:00:49\r\n                            So, you can see the connection. Do you see the connection? Let's read it. Starting at 67. [38:67] Say, \"Here is awesome news. [38:68] \"That you are totally oblivious to. [38:69] \"I did not possess any knowledge about the feud in the High Society.\r\n                            Feud in the High society.\r\n                            1:01:03\r\n                            Which is called (38:67) نَبَؤٌا۟ عَظِيمٌ in Arabic. (38:67) قُلْ هُوَ نَبَؤٌا۟ عَظِيمٌ It's an awesome, it's a crucial incident in the history of the universe.\r\n                            1:01:15\r\n                            69, [38:69] \"I did not possess any knowledge about the feud in the High Society. [38:70] \"I am inspired that my sole mission is to deliver the warnings to you.\"\r\n                            1:01:22\r\n                            [38:71] Your Lord said to the angels, \"I am creating a human being from clay. [38:72] \"Once I perfect him, and blow into him from My spirit, you shall fall prostrate before him.\"\r\n                            1:01:31\r\n                            [38:73] The angels fell prostrate, all of them, [38:74] only Satan refused; he was too arrogant, unappreciative.\r\n                            1:01:37\r\n                            [38:75] God said, \"O Satan, what prevented you from prostrating before the one I created with My hands? Were you too arrogant? Have you rebelled?\"\r\n                            1:01:46\r\n                            [38:76] He said, \"I am better than he;.... So, this is what, the same thing we read, except we see it connected with the Great Feud.\r\n                            1:01:54\r\n                            And you see the Great Feud ahead of this, the Great Feud that triggered this whole business.\r\n                            1:01:59\r\n                            Now before the Great Feud, what was happening? Adam and Eve and you and I were in existence, the angels and the jinns and everybody.\r\n                            1:02:06\r\n                            And there was no feud. Everything was wonderful. Then the Feud happened with the rebellion.\r\n                            1:02:15\r\n                            (38:69) ٱلْمَلَإِ ٱلْأَعْلَىٰٓ إِذْ يَخْتَصِمُونَ The High Society feuded.\r\n                            1:02:20\r\n                            You can pick up in Farsi some of this. ٱلْمَلَإِ ٱلْأَعْلَىٰٓ is the High Society. إِذْ يَخْتَصِمُونَ - Do you have KHISAM?\r\n                            1:02:28\r\n                            So, Alhamdu Lillah. This is what triggered the whole thing, this rebellion.\r\n                            1:02:35\r\n                            So what does God do with the rebels? The angels suggested \"put them in Hell.\"\r\n                            1:02:42\r\n                            The angels said \"put them all in Hell.\" God said \"I know what you do not know. I'm gonna give them another chance.\"\r\n                            1:02:47\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:02:53\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: So, the plan calls for putting all of them to death, bringing them in this earth,\r\n                            1:03:01\r\n                            having no recollection at all of what happened in the past. It's about the fresh start. It's a whole new chance.\r\n                            1:03:12\r\n                            And we are given God's message and Satan's message. We're making a choice.\r\n                            1:03:18\r\n                            As you see, the vast majority of humans are still sticking to their old rebellion.\r\n                            1:03:23\r\n                            Why are the people hostile to this?\r\n                            1:03:28\r\n                            They're not even indifferent. They're hostile to this. You should talk to some of the people that call us on the telephone.\r\n                            1:03:35\r\n                            I mean, why? They curse me and my mother. Why? I mean, they never saw my mother.\r\n                            1:03:41\r\n                            A woman: They never saw you. Dr. Khalifa: They never saw me. And I tell them \"what did I do to you?\" I mean, and Ihsan, I put her on the telephone. I put her through this the last time.\r\n                            1:03:52\r\n                            And she said \"we are saying La Elaha Ella Allah. Why are you so upset?\" And she said \"don't you have any neighbors who are saying Jesus is God or son of God? Why don't you go bother them? Why are you bothering us?\"\r\n                            1:04:03\r\n                            We are saying \"La Elaha Ella Allah. So, it's just fine. Go say what you want and we say what we want. Why are you so upset?\"\r\n                            1:04:09\r\n                            What else did he say? I forget. Ihsan: He said \"Muhammad Rasulullah.\"\r\n                            1:04:17\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Oh yes, that was wonderful. Ihsan: (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:04:29\r\n                            Ihsan: He said... I said \"when was the last time you said Saleh Rasulullah?\" He said \"no. Is that mean if I don't said Saleh Rasulullah, that I don't acknowledge Saleh?\"\r\n                            1:04:40\r\n                            I said \"exactly. If we don't say Muhammad Rasulullah, that we don't acknowledge Muhammad?\" Dr. Khalifa: Yes, that was a very good point. She told him\r\n                            1:04:47\r\n                            \"when was the last time, she said, God said, don't make distinction among the messengers.\" \"When was the last time you said La Elaha Ella Allah Rasulullah?\"\r\n                            1:04:54\r\n                            He said \"just because I don't say Saleh Rasulullah, does not mean I don't recognize Saleh as Rasulullah. She said \"exactly. Just because we don't say Muhammad Rasulullah, does not mean we don't acknowledge Muhammad as Rasulullah.\"\r\n                            1:05:04\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: She got him. Parivash: I had a dream 2-3 weeks ago, and I, in the dream, I was teaching, I was to Iran, and teach some Molla (religious scholar), very famous Molla there.\r\n                            1:05:17\r\n                            And I, in my dream, I was teaching him something that in my... God wants to teach me something because in...\r\n                            1:05:27\r\n                            when I wake up, I say \"oh, I have never idea of this.\" And I ask him \"ok, when you say, Ash hadu an Muhammadan Rasulullah, ok, tell me what does it mean, the Shahada?\"\r\n                            1:05:39\r\n                            And he told me \"ok, everything that you see.\" And I say \"ok, we say Shahada, every time that we use the Shahada, even in the court or something, you have to see something...I was\"\r\n                            1:05:51\r\n                            And the Sura 7:172, we saw the God. That's why we can say, Ash-hadu Alla Elaha Ella Allah. Dr. Khalifa: We witnessed God.\r\n                            1:05:59\r\n                            Parivash: But have you ever seen Muhammad with your eyes? Dr. Khalifa: Did you see Muhammad? Mã Shã Allãh. Dr. Khalifa: Mã Shã Allãh. It's fantastic.\r\n                            1:06:05\r\n                            Cause \"Ash-hadu\" is witnessing. (unintelligible). Parivash: And when I was telling somebody, and he said \"no, because you can say of the Quran, is this Shahada enough?\r\n                            1:06:19\r\n                            Because Quran is the shahada.\" I said \"no.\" Just imagine, if you go to the court, and you have to see something and say, yes, I saw it.\r\n                            1:06:28\r\n                            But if you have the evidence, still you cannot say \"I am witness that this happened.\"\r\n                            1:06:33\r\n                            You can say \"I have a lot of evidence,\" but evidence, witness, that is, you cannot say \"I am witness.\"\r\n                            1:06:42\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Mã Shã Allãh. This is beautiful. This is a breakthrough. When you say \"Ash-hadu Alla Elaha Ella Allah\", I bear witness, or I bore witness,\r\n                            1:06:50\r\n                            I am an eyewitness to the fact that there is no god except God, and we have it in 7:172 here.\r\n                            1:06:56\r\n                            Because God said \"I gathered all the humans, and they all bore witness that I am their Lord and Master.\r\n                            1:07:01\r\n                            Have you bore witness that Muhammad is Rasulullah? Mã Shã Allãh. In a dream, mind you.\r\n                            1:07:07\r\n                            A man: When in that Sura, I'm thinking that's why God called them liars. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Yes, exactly. A woman: Yes. God called them liars.\r\n                            1:07:14\r\n                            It says, (63:1) نَشْهَدُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُ ٱللَّهِ We bear witness that you are God's Messenger, because they... yeah, this is...\r\n                            1:07:21\r\n                            Parivash: Yeah, even you, after I tell someone in a dream, I said \"no, still you can say, because of the evidence.\"\r\n                            1:07:28\r\n                            Okay, you can say that we have evidence that he is the (unintelligible) but not you. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            1:07:35\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Because we were eyewitnesses that God is La Elaha Ella Allah, He is the only God.\r\n                            1:07:41\r\n                            But we were never eyewitnesses to the fact that Muhammad is Rasulullah. A man: Now that they say this, they are lying. Dr. Khalifa: Yes, exactly.\r\n                            1:07:48\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Because they did not bear witness that Muhammad is Rasulullah. Did you catch this? Edip: I know. In addition, I'm thinking on this.\r\n                            1:07:56\r\n                            Edip: Just accept the... Edip: (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:08:03\r\n                            Edip: How can a person be eyewitness that he is messenger from the evidence? Dr. Khalifa: Right.\r\n                            1:08:08\r\n                            Edip: No, no, how? Dr. Khalifa: Right. I was gonna say that. No, I am criticizing the subject, and during the time of Prophet Muhammad when he is alive also,\r\n                            1:08:19\r\n                            how can it be possible to see that he is messenger? You don't see that he received the WAHY and also from clues. Dr. Khalifa: Exactly. Revelation. Yes.\r\n                            1:08:31\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: This is what I'm saying that even at the time of the Prophet Muhammad, that's what the others brought up. Even at the time of the Prophet Muhammad, they could not witness the fact that he is Rasulullah.\r\n                            1:08:39\r\n                            Just he's saying he's Rasulullah. And then you think about it, examine the evidence, whatever, and make a decision.\r\n                            1:08:46\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: But they don't witness the revelation coming down, or Gabriel coming down. This is nothing to witness. Edip: Yes.\r\n                            1:08:54\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Therefore, the only thing is the Shahada, is La Elaha Ella Allah. You're sitting there quiet, you've been here almost 24 hours, you didn't tell us about this.\r\n                            1:09:03\r\n                            Edip: But in another verse, Rashad.... A woman: Yesterday, something came up and yeah... Edip: 22, The last verse of 22 says, Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            1:09:14\r\n                            وَجَـٰهِدُوا۟ فِى ٱللَّهِ حَقَّ جِهَادِهِۦ ۚ هُوَ ٱجْتَبَىٰكُمْ وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِى ٱلدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍۢ ۚ مِّلَّةَ أَبِيكُمْ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ ۚ هُوَ سَمَّىٰكُمُ (22:78) ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ مِن قَبْلُ\r\n                            1:09:23\r\n                            (22:78) لِيَكُونَ ٱلرَّسُولُ شَهِيدًا عَلَيْكُمْ وَتَكُونُوا۟ شُهَدَآءَ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ Edip: About what?\r\n                            1:09:30\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: About the man I talked to in Canada, for example, I bear witness that he was a disbeliever.\r\n                            1:09:36\r\n                            I bear witness that I gave him the message and he did not agree with it.\r\n                            1:09:41\r\n                            You will bear witness that you talked to the guy who was here for three hours telling him \"God alone, Quran alone,\" and he wouldn't listen to you.\r\n                            1:09:49\r\n                            This is what (22:78) وَتَكُونُوا۟ شُهَدَآءَ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ You bear witness. We will be called to bear witness on those people.\r\n                            1:09:57\r\n                            That we gave them the message of God alone and they refused it. Edip: Rashad, that means that at the same time to exit, maybe.\r\n                            1:10:09\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Bear witness. When I bear... Let's talk in court. You say \"yes, I gave him a hundred dollars.\"\r\n                            1:10:16\r\n                            Alright, so this person gave this person a hundred dollars. Bearing witness.\r\n                            1:10:22\r\n                            Obviously, there will be disputes on the Day of Judgment. And the Quran says \"they will deny idol worship, even though they were idolaters.\"\r\n                            1:10:32\r\n                            So, there'll be witnesses. A woman: (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Yes, yes.\r\n                            1:10:41\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: So, everything will be very clear. Atif: Also, (6:24) كَيْفَ كَذَبُوا۟ عَلَىٰٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ ۚ\r\n                            1:10:47\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yes, (6:24) كَذَبُوا۟ عَلَىٰٓ أَنفُسِهِمْ They lied to themselves. Wonderful, wonderful. I think we'll stop right here and just continue discussions and questions.\r\n                            1:10:57\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: These are very heavy verses. Atif: That's what's Eve creation. Was it really mentioned that Eve was created from Adam?\r\n                            Adam’s creation was the “master plate” – everyone else cloned from that i.e. Eve.\r\n                            1:11:04\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yes. (4:1) خَلَقَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا I remember that. Atif: But this means Eve was created from Adam.\r\n                            1:11:10\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Cloning with feminine creatures. Atif: But nothing mentioned, at least from creating....\r\n                            1:11:16\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Also, God says. (31:28) مَّا خَلْقُكُمْ وَلَا بَعْثُكُمْ إِلَّا كَنَفْسٍۢ وَٰحِدَةٍ Your creation, your resurrection is of one person.\r\n                            1:11:24\r\n                            Adam is the master plate. You know, in printing, they make a master plate. They make copies from it.\r\n                            1:11:33\r\n                            A man: Eve's own body was created from (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Exactly.\r\n                            1:11:40\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: But Eve and... Eve was through cloning. Atif: (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:11:50\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: I mean, cloning now is theoretically possible. In fact, they do have cloning from other creatures.\r\n                            1:11:58\r\n                            I did some cloning myself, by the way, of carrots, of carrots. I published it in Nature.\r\n                            1:12:07\r\n                            I forget that I was a scientist some day. Nature magazine is a very respected magazine, and they don't publish anything unless they go through a lot of quality screening.\r\n                            1:12:19\r\n                            I have cloned some carrots. tissue culture system. Pictures are published there. I mean, I have some copies.\r\n                            1:12:28\r\n                            (unintelligible) is not the only scientist around. A woman: (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:12:36\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, no, that's another one. That's a hormone, a growth hormone. They put it in a gel block on one side, cause this side to grow faster than this side, so it curves.\r\n                            1:12:48\r\n                            All of them curve. The one that was not treated continues to be (unintelligible). A man: Let me ask you a question. You know what? August 2010. You pick somebody's heart. The guy is dead, but his heart is still alive.\r\n                            The Human is a BODY – SOUL – SPIRIT.\r\n                            1:13:03\r\n                            What kind of life is that? I mean,... Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:13:09\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: The body is still alive. Are you talking about the soul?\r\n                            1:13:15\r\n                            A man: The soul is gone. The guys gets in a car accident. You pick his heart, his kidney, his eyes.\r\n                            1:13:20\r\n                            And he has to be alive also. The difference between a dead heart and a live heart. So what's actually... what's life? I think about this a lot.\r\n                            1:13:27\r\n                            A man: What's the life? What's the life in there? Dr. Khalifa: Ok. I think what... Dr. Khalifa: I think what you're talking about, the entities of the human person, the components of the human person.\r\n                            1:13:35\r\n                            And they always eliminate this part. But if you wanna really be more specific, the human is a body, a spirit, and a soul.\r\n                            1:13:45\r\n                            So, a body is this, but it's without life. The spirit makes the heart pump and the lungs breathe.\r\n                            1:13:52\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: The soul is the person. Atif: Ok, I just wanna focus here. I just remember the guy who was telling you the story about his body.\r\n                            1:13:59\r\n                            So, he was already out of his body, but his body is still alive. But his soul was free. I mean, he played with it. He could take his heart\r\n                            1:14:05\r\n                            He squeezed it and everything. He also... Dr. Khalifa: The spirit is part of the physical being. Atif: Ok, so, his organ was living, but he was really.... soul was out.\r\n                            1:14:12\r\n                            (unintelligible) There's no, there's no, there's no activity in the body then\r\n                            1:14:20\r\n                            a body with activity in it, and then a body was a tree. Dr. Khalifa: Look at Jesus. Just look at what happened to Jesus. Jesus, the person, left.\r\n                            1:14:29\r\n                            He left the spirit and the body. They put the body and the spirit as part of the physical being.\r\n                            1:14:35\r\n                            They put the body and then the body breathes. Then, mechanically, there's no blood to pump.\r\n                            1:14:40\r\n                            So, the spirit leaves. The body is being left. A man: So, the spirit leaves the body. Dr. Khalifa: The soul. Right. The soul. The person leaves.\r\n                            1:14:49\r\n                            A man: Yes, the soul leaves. Dr. Khalifa: Then, the spirit is... Dr. Khalifa: You have two entities, the spirit and the body.\r\n                            1:14:55\r\n                            A man: Then, the body dies. Dr. Khalifa: Then, the spirit leaves. The body dies. A man: The spirit is a separate entity or?\r\n                            1:15:01\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: The spirit is... You can think of it as the word of God that goes... Atif: That's the thing. Well, you can think of it as a symbol of somebody's dying. Just somebody dies (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:15:11\r\n                            He's been alive for 20 years. (Unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: They keep the heart alive.\r\n                            1:15:17\r\n                            A man: But why separate the spirit and the body? Dr. Khalifa: There are two components of the physical being.\r\n                            1:15:25\r\n                            But they're two separate components. A man: But when God says that I blew into him from My spirit, then what does that mean?\r\n                            1:15:32\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: That's the spirit that caused life. A man: That causes our body to function. Dr. Khalifa: Right.\r\n                            1:15:38\r\n                            Atif: Now, you can think of anything as a physical growth. You can think of it as a piece of skin. (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:15:44\r\n                            Growth from your own cells. Big pieces put back in your body. (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:15:51\r\n                            A man: So, spirit is just like the body but it has... I mean, Like the soul, obviously, you know, the...\r\n                            1:15:57\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: It's the person. A man: It's the person and the right and wrong and all that... Atif: It's the right thing. It is actually the thinking one\r\n                            1:16:05\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Oh yeah, the intellect is in the soul. Atif: Yeah, because the body... the heart of somebody who is already dead. It's still functioning.\r\n                            1:16:12\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: There's no intellect in it. Atif: (unintelligible). A man: Once I noticed that all of us, all nations, different languages, without realizing, we admit that\r\n                            1:16:24\r\n                            when I say \"I\", I'm not my body. Because if you notice, you say \"my hand, my face, my head.\" Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Yes.\r\n                            1:16:33\r\n                            A man: My whole body is, for instance, hurting. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. A man: And Also, if you realize, what happens if one of my hands gets, actually, they cut it.\r\n                            1:16:45\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: You're still there. Yes. Atif: It's still you. A man: So, actually, when we say \"my, I, my body, my face\", actually, we are admitting that...\r\n                            1:16:55\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: that I'm separate. A man: The person is that. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. A man: I... Dr. Khalifa: The hand that belongs to me, right. A man: To me.\r\n                            1:17:02\r\n                            Atif: (unintelligible). You see, I remember a few people in accidents being paralyzed from the knee down.\r\n                            1:17:08\r\n                            And their whole body is sitting there giving sores and troubles. And the guy is saying\r\n                            1:17:14\r\n                            \"I know everything. You know, you go to college, you graduate, have PhDs. And...\" Dr. Khalifa: She was talking about (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:17:19\r\n                            Atif: That's right. (unintelligible). Atif: A year ago, there was a guy from some kind of university in Europe was completely paralyzed. He was a genius in mathematics.\r\n                            1:17:28\r\n                            And also he was against God. He just was sitting this way. And he's sitting there. A man: (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:17:33\r\n                            Atif: Cause the guy, he talked through special aids. And he's paraplegic and moved nothing.\r\n                            1:17:39\r\n                            And he's there, you know. And he's so angry because his whole body is down here. And I think he realized, that's not him, I mean.\r\n                            1:17:46\r\n                            (unintelligible) You can be up to here, but still you have your soul. (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:17:53\r\n                            A man: Is that Stephen Hawking? Dr. Khalifa: Yes, Hawking. Do you know (unintelligible)? A man: For Hawking? Dr. Khalifa: Yes, the computer talks for him. Exactly.\r\n                            Discussion about Steven Hawkins.\r\n                            1:18:00\r\n                            Atif: And he goes all over the world talking about his experience at talks. He goes all the way...\r\n                            1:18:06\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yesterday, what he said was \"if the rate of expansion of the universe was one millionth\r\n                            1:18:16\r\n                            of the speed faster, we will have nothing. It would be just space now.\r\n                            1:18:21\r\n                            And if it was one millionth of the speed slower, we will be compact and life cannot exist.\r\n                            1:18:31\r\n                            We will not be here. He said the rate of expansion of the universe is precise, is so precise.\r\n                            1:18:37\r\n                            But he doesn't recognize God. Atif: He doesn't know God. A man: And he's sitting there. And he's Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            1:18:43\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: He's just a little soul hanging on his head, you know. He really is a genius.\r\n                            1:18:48\r\n                            Atif: Yeah, yeah, it's funny. Yeah, it's funny he mentioned his soul, he's just speaking to this blue piece of (unintelligible). And everything is lost.\r\n                            1:18:54\r\n                            And I think it, I think it shows how much blessing we get because he's a guy with the biggest brain in the whole world now. And he's absolutely prevented from living there. He just...\r\n                            1:19:06\r\n                            A man: Just recently, in San Francisco, some person died. Just one person died.\r\n                            1:19:12\r\n                            A man: He donated six different organs to six different people. Atif: Yes. A man: Who do you think it is?\r\n                            1:19:18\r\n                            (unintelligible) to donate (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:19:27\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: I wouldn't do it mainly because of maybe (unintelligible) Because of the humiliation the body goes through.\r\n                            1:19:33\r\n                            Because I've seen it. A man: What's the difference if you're dead and gone? What is... Dr. Khalifa: It doesn't make any difference. I want my body cremated and flushed down the toilet. I don't want it, I don't want it pulled around with it.\r\n                            1:19:42\r\n                            They hang it, they hang them like a cow from a ceiling. And It's really mistreated.\r\n                            1:19:48\r\n                            Atif: They don't do that. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Yes, they do that. Because that's what they do. Listen. Ok. Listen to...what do they do?\r\n                            1:19:56\r\n                            They want to... A man: Rashad, (unintelligible). A man: Before you get into that, there was a scandal in England that over-enthusiastic, you know, doctors would kill a person.\r\n                            1:20:08\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Oh, my God. A man: Yes. A man: When you said \"I would like to (unintelligible)\", you're not already dead.\r\n                            1:20:16\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Just hurry up. A man: They need a heart somewhere. Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible). A man: And through their enthusiasm they'll just finish you off. That's what they do. A man: Business, business, yeah.\r\n                            1:20:22\r\n                            A man: This happened in England. It was a scandal. Atif: That was a rumor. But I was at this...\r\n                            1:20:27\r\n                            Some of the patients in the ICU were very sick, very sick patients. They had a breathing machine, everything, medication for the heart, and everything.\r\n                            1:20:37\r\n                            And I felt so bad about it. And We had orders. (unintelligible) Well, half of the family told us to donate the organs.\r\n                            1:20:45\r\n                            And I feel so bad about it. Some people just don't take it well. You know, somebody... If a family member is still alive and you told him \"can I take your heart?\"\r\n                            1:20:55\r\n                            Atif: It's just a terrible thing. And there's so much burden on me. Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible). And I remember this guy was so embarrassed. Almost that could not even talk. He wanted to talk to his wife.\r\n                            1:21:05\r\n                            And I told him, you know, \"if something happens to him, we need to do this or that.\" And he was so angry, almost so (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:21:13\r\n                            She responded so fast. I was so suspicious. She was hoping to finish him.\r\n                            1:21:19\r\n                            She was just giving information so fast. And I remember. I got shocked. My God, this woman was finishing him.\r\n                            1:21:27\r\n                            I was so attached to the patient. I didn't want him to get over this and recover. Dr. Khalifa: Oh, she hated him. Atif: Oh, yes. She hated him. She had so much (unintelligibile), she was gonna get out of here. (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:21:37\r\n                            (unintelligible). Atif: Some people do have this syndrome. \"Yeah, finish him. Yeah, (unintelligible).\"\r\n                            1:21:43\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: \"Where do I have to sign?\" \"Can you do it yesterday?\"\r\n                            1:21:49\r\n                            A woman: \"You need to take the organs.\"\r\n                            1:21:57\r\n                            Atif: \"You need to take the organs\" They have to take everything. Atif: It's just like your surgery, they keep you breathing and everything, they open you and take everything out, everything.\r\n                            1:22:06\r\n                            A woman: What if he's still alive? I mean,... Atif: (unintelligible) could be, I mean... Of course, it's very difficult to define the moment of death.\r\n                            1:22:15\r\n                            There have been meetings and meetings, conferences and could nobody knows exactly when the moment of death is.\r\n                            1:22:21\r\n                            Who defines death? Who says this guy is dead or not? And I think the final thing he decided to do is check the brain.\r\n                            1:22:27\r\n                            And he issues a brain electricity wave.\r\n                            1:22:33\r\n                            And if he lost his wave in the brain location, he declares him dead.\r\n                            1:22:39\r\n                            And we always know here that people have been on the breathing machine for years and they just rise there and they just don't function. Their brain's dead.\r\n                            1:22:47\r\n                            And we see a lot. So, if the brain is dead, your body actually... your heart is still beating, your kidneys are still functioning.\r\n                            1:22:53\r\n                            And it's amazing when people have their brains dead, their body is in excellent shape. If they ever get to the point where they can transplant the brain, this is the moment when you get somebody back. It just never happened anyway because it's so complicated.\r\n                            1:23:06\r\n                            Atif: which actually, you know, most probably the brain is the soul, you know. If you get somebody's brain transplanted, you actually need to transplant a soul in this body.\r\n                            1:23:13\r\n                            It's a perfect body, except the brain is dead. So, these are the people, young, healthy guys in a car accident.\r\n                            1:23:21\r\n                            (unintelligible) And these are the guys who have everything clean. You just take the heart, kidneys, everything and give it to somebody else.\r\n                            1:23:29\r\n                            So, the soul is gone. A man: The soul must be in brain. A man: connected with the brain.\r\n                            1:23:34\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, no. The brain is just the physical... Atif: The physical part that expresses the soul.\r\n                            1:23:40\r\n                            Probably. What's that? Dr. Khalifa: It's the physical tool. It's like you and the computer. You can think of the brain as a computer.\r\n                            1:23:46\r\n                            Atif: You're not running the computer. Dr. Khalifa: You have to run it. Atif: If you don't know how to run a computer, you'll think they're all the same.\r\n                            1:23:53\r\n                            Edip: What stimulates brain to work? Dr. Khalifa: See, the brain is only but electrons moving around, just like the computer exactly.\r\n                            1:24:01\r\n                            Of course, it's a clumsy representation of the brain. A man: But I've read articles that you can add or remove some hormones. You can do different stimuli. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            1:24:18\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Because they affect the function of the brain, but the brain is strictly physical.\r\n                            1:24:23\r\n                            Atif: Yes, of course, there's a map of the brain. This is the foot, this is the hand, this is the ear, and mechanically or electrically\r\n                            1:24:31\r\n                            you touch these areas and make what you want, which is the physical part. But like you're saying, you, the real person, you, is the soul.\r\n                            1:24:41\r\n                            Cause you're just using these organs for your benefit, using the eyes, using the ears\r\n                            1:24:47\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Including the brain. Dr. Khalifa: I thank God for my out-of-body experience that I had many years ago cause\r\n                            1:24:53\r\n                            I was looking at my body down there and it was just like a piece of rock.\r\n                            1:24:58\r\n                            Edip: Amount of hormones, who determines that hormone? What determines the amount of the other hormones, that hormone?\r\n                            1:25:04\r\n                            And there must be all of them that determines the amount of hormones in the brain and their stimulation.\r\n                            1:25:10\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: There is a maestro. A maestro orchestrates the levels of hormones.\r\n                            1:25:21\r\n                            Edip: Or the physical, it destroys the physical by itself or from others but that soul cannot communicate with our world through this.\r\n                            1:25:35\r\n                            Edip: One receiver, radio, we have a receiver or the other station that radiates.\r\n                            1:25:42\r\n                            And one of them - how do you say it? - it doesn't work.\r\n                            1:25:48\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Nothing happens. Edip: Nothing happens Dr. Khalifa: You'd have to have a transmitter and a receiver.\r\n                            1:25:53\r\n                            A woman: That's when you say the brain is dead. But here, that's my understanding of what I already know. That's every function we do. That's all that comes from the brain?\r\n                            1:26:05\r\n                            Atif: A lot of organs have their own, what we call, also mechanisms. You know, the heart can keep beating with a special built-in mechanism.\r\n                            1:26:13\r\n                            A woman: Does it come from there? Atif: The heart will regulate certain things, certain things, like how fast it goes, which one to, you know,\r\n                            1:26:22\r\n                            which to pump more blood and which to pump less blood. There's a control, of course, but some organs have their own built-in mechanism.\r\n                            1:26:31\r\n                            But the brain has to balance it. You have to balance the kidney with the heart with the whole balance system.\r\n                            1:26:37\r\n                            If you can... one work more than the others, then you lost everything. So, the brain has that but you know, you see, like the computer, you have to set exactly for the second, for millionth of second,\r\n                            1:26:48\r\n                            how much blood comes out and how much the heart beats would go and how much goes to your\r\n                            1:26:54\r\n                            big toe and how much goes to your feet. So, all this is exactly controlled. If you lose the brain, this is what really controlled very much.\r\n                            1:27:00\r\n                            But the heart, I think, we all have seen it in chicken, when you cut their neck completely\r\n                            1:27:07\r\n                            and let it go, it's gonna run for a little bit, you know, until the brain is completely... A woman: Yeah, for a little bit, but if it's for a long time, can they...\r\n                            1:27:15\r\n                            Atif: No, no, for human beings, (unintelligible). So, these people, they have to kill the machines. What the machine does is just keep bumping things with the heart and make it come back.\r\n                            1:27:23\r\n                            They have to keep putting oxygen down the lung against the will and go up. We have to have things work for the kidney.\r\n                            1:27:29\r\n                            And also for a period of time. After a while, everything is deteriorating because you can never balance, do the balance as much as the brain.\r\n                            1:27:39\r\n                            Your chemistry is completely screwed up when the brain goes away. Edip: Sometimes they are still alive when they make brain surgery on birds and take their brains (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:27:52\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, the lungs are the same way as the heart. It's all mechanical. Atif: When we were little kids, we used to get things like the goose lung and a blow on it to make fun of it.\r\n                            1:28:03\r\n                            You can see the whole thing like a balloon in and out. You do the same thing with that guy. (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:28:08\r\n                            You just want to be up (unintelligible) and his heart is pumping, you know, the blood goes, the oxygen goes back.\r\n                            1:28:15\r\n                            And then they have equipment where they put special pumps inside the heart and just keep all the blood closed and just pump the blood from the heart.\r\n                            1:28:25\r\n                            All kinds of fancy stuff. A man: I don't understand. For example, if brain does not work properly, the body's malfunction, the speech malfunction, or the soul's malfunction?\r\n                            1:28:41\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Just the body.\r\n                            1:28:47\r\n                            Atif: You know, most probably, (unintelligible), we can procure organs for them.\r\n                            1:28:53\r\n                            We do have some functions of the brain that keep things (unintelligible) going.\r\n                            1:29:00\r\n                            But the part which really does do the thinking and the real living, which is the soul, it's, you know, I'm sure if you open his head, most of them can find a little bruise on it. This is what qualifies the rest of the brain as OK.\r\n                            1:29:11\r\n                            But actually, we look at it this way, the brain is dead, which actually means the soul is out.\r\n                            1:29:16\r\n                            The brain might have been OK, but we don't know that. I mean, you can physically say the soul is out.\r\n                            1:29:21\r\n                            You can do that. All you can say is that the brain is dead. The brain is dead is actually the soul is out. The brain is intact? Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:29:27\r\n                            Atif: Yeah, but I think (unintelligible) the brain is intact. The soul is out. It doesn't work. So,... A woman: (unintelligible). When the brain is dead, the person actually is dead.\r\n                            1:29:40\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: The person is gone. A woman: gone. A woman: But maybe there is some function. Atif: Oh, yeah, the (unintelligible) is functioning. A woman: But the brain is dead, is dead.\r\n                            1:29:49\r\n                            Atif: I think brain.... Dr. Khalifa: Sometimes the brain is not dead and the person is gone. Like, in case of Bill Schroeder who lived 19 months without the soul.\r\n                            1:29:59\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: The body was functioning. The person was eating and drinking and going to the bathroom. But he didn't recognize... A woman: See, because I knew... I don't know.\r\n                            1:30:08\r\n                            A woman: I can't remember the name of this guy, you know.\r\n                            1:30:14\r\n                            A woman: He had some surgery. And after, during the time of surgery, when the surgery finished, he was asleep at that time.\r\n                            1:30:25\r\n                            And then he woke up. Wake up and after that... But for a long time, 10 or 15 years, he was in that situation.\r\n                            1:30:37\r\n                            And he was dead. Actually, he was dead. Dr. Khalifa: What happened after the 10 years?\r\n                            1:30:43\r\n                            A woman: And then he, yeah, came, yeah. Dr. Khalifa: Came back? Atif: You know what this was (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:30:48\r\n                            Ask me I have more experience. (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:30:55\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, this would be like the people of the cave. They went to sleep for 300 years.\r\n                            1:31:03\r\n                            A woman: Because of that, everybody knew about him. Atif: I heard about a few days would be this. You know (unintelligible). In one of these days, she came back.\r\n                            1:31:13\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Perfect. And that's why nothing happened. A man: Did she come back? Atif: I don't know. I was just reading about it. I have no experience with her.\r\n                            1:31:20\r\n                            (unintelligible) the same way. But that's why so many families, when they have a loved one in a similar situation, already brain dead, they always have been for this minute when\r\n                            1:31:32\r\n                            their loved ones will come back, like these little stories we hear. And most of the time, it doesn't. Most of the time, your body deteriorates.\r\n                            1:31:39\r\n                            Sitting in bed, you get a great sore, you get pneumonia, you get all kinds of infections. And you keep (unintelligible) your body, waiting for it to come back.\r\n                            1:31:47\r\n                            And nobody knows if you ever come back. And you start seeing your loved ones getting in terrible, miserable shape. I mean, you have (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:31:56\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: But we have this in the Quran. People of the cave were asleep for 309 years.\r\n                            1:32:02\r\n                            Atif: But did anybody walk in this cave? Dr. Khalifa: They came back and said \"let's have lunch. Here's some money. Go get us some lunch. They took this ancient money to the market.\r\n                            \r\n                            \r\n                            \r\n                            14 Quran Study From Behrouz 414 Night Of Destiny Zikr By Rashad\r\n                            \r\n                            \r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: The equivalence of going from a baby to a young person, a teenager.\r\n                            0:10\r\n                            If we started out as babies, we are now teenagers.\r\n                            0:16\r\n                            That's how powerful the ZIKR is. It's God's absolutely most beloved form of worship, according to the Quran.\r\n                            0:27\r\n                            And it is the most... it is the steak and lobster dinner for the soul\r\n                            0:40\r\n                            And if we are to visualize the importance of Zikr, you can imagine the Day of Resurrection\r\n                            0:46\r\n                            and people being resurrected as babies.

You can imagine an adult in a community of babies.\r\n                            4:17\r\n                            What a situation, I mean how, how will they look up to that adult?\r\n                            4:23\r\n                            That would be an approximation of what happens on the Day of Resurrection.\r\n                            4:31\r\n                            And people are resurrected. Adults are resurrected. Young people are resurrected. Babies. The vast majority.\r\n                            4:40\r\n                            People are resurrected who neglected their soul.\r\n                            4:50\r\n                            As you know, the goal of our life is to recognize that God Alone we should worship.\r\n                            4:57\r\n                            And to declare that there is no god except the One God. La Elaha Ella Allah لَآ إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ (There is no god except the One God.)\r\n                            5:02\r\n                            So when you say it, close your eyes and concentrate. And let every cell in your body say it and mean it.\r\n                            5:11\r\n                            And absorb it. Until it becomes the dominant thought.\r\n                            5:18\r\n                            La Elaha Ella Allah لَآ إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ (There is no god except the One God.) La Elaha Ella Allah لَآ إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ (There is no god except the One God.)\r\n                            The deeper intention of meditation the more one grows.\r\n                            8:11\r\n                            The more you say it, the more you mean it, the more you grow with the consequences, enjoyable consequences.\r\n                            8:20\r\n                            La Elaha Ella Allah لَآ إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ (There is no god except the One God.) La Elaha Ella Allah لَآ إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ (There is no god except the One God.)\r\n                            Meditation could be equivalent to a 100 salat, mentioning the name of Allah wipes out sins. Good way to make hopefully wipe away missed Salat…..\r\n                            14:50\r\n                            God speaks in the first person singular in the Quran saying you shall observe Salat for the purpose of commemorating Me.\r\n                            15:00\r\n                            وَأَقِمِ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ Observe the Salat (Contact Prayers) لِذِكْرِىٓ for commemorating Me\r\n                            15:06\r\n                            So when we make Zikr in this way, it is equivalent to making a hundred Salat or maybe more.\r\n                            15:14\r\n                            And every time we say \"Allah\", the name of God, we wipe out God knows how many sins,\r\n                            15:20\r\n                            how many of our sins are wiped out from the past. So, we make up for all the past years when we missed the Salat and we wipe out all the mistakes and sins that we have committed in the past.\r\n                            15:31\r\n                            Every time we say \"Allah.\" So, let it come out of your heart and be big enough to travel across the universe and reach for God, go up there.\r\n                            15:38\r\n                            Let your soul go. Close your eyes. Concentrate. And enjoy saying the name of God.\r\n                            15:46\r\n                            Allah ٱللَّهُ (God) Allah ٱللَّهُ (God)\r\n                            16:54\r\n                            Allah ٱللَّهُ (God) Allah ٱللَّهُ (God)\r\n                            18:13\r\n                            Let's start with a whsiper. Allah ٱللَّهُ (God)\r\n                            20:26\r\n                            When you say \"Qayyum\", you recognize God as the Absolute and Eternal King.\r\n                            20:33\r\n                            Qayyum قَيُّوم (Absolute and Eternal King) Qayyum قَيُّوم (Absolute and Eternal King)\r\n                            22:07\r\n                            Allah ٱللَّهُ (God)\r\n                            24:16\r\n                            Subhan Allah سُبْحَـٰنَ ٱللَّه (God be glorified) Subhan Allah سُبْحَـٰنَ ٱللَّه (God be glorified)\r\n                            26:51\r\n                            Alhamdu Lillah ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّه (GOD be praised) Alhamdu Lillah ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّه (GOD be praised)\r\n                            28:30\r\n                            Allahu Akbar ٱللَّهِ أَكْبَر (God is great) Allahu Akbar ٱللَّهِ أَكْبَر (God is great)\r\n                            Humans are the only creatures in the universe who can freely chose God, this results in a great achievement. Dr. Rashad Khalifa uses the allegory of praying a 100 times a day or giving up ones eyesight, God did not put that on us. Watching moments of yourself worshipping God on the day of Judgement will make you pleased.\r\n                            30:30\r\n                            God teaches us in the Quran that everything, the seven universes and. earth and everything in them glorifies God.\r\n                            30:38\r\n                            The word is Subhan Allah. That's glorification of God. And it is because they decided to recognize God as the Absolute Master and they had no choice.\r\n                            30:51\r\n                            But we, the human beings, are the only ones in the universe that have the choice.\r\n                            30:56\r\n                            So when you make the choice to glorify God on your own, with your own free will, you attain a great achievement.\r\n                            31:06\r\n                            When people fail to glorify God, saying Subhan Allah, and praise God by saying Alhamdu Lillah, they are described in Quran as stupid and ignorant, stupid and ignorant, unjust or unappreciative.\r\n                            31:24\r\n                            God gave us our eyes. A human being will do anything\r\n                            31:29\r\n                            if somebody holds a gun to his head and demands his eyes or pray a hundred times a day, then they will say \"OK, I pray a hundred times a day and keep my eyes.\"\r\n                            31:42\r\n                            But they are unappreciative of God. God gave them the eyes in advance without any requirements. The requirement is, you have the free choice to worship God and glorify Him or not.\r\n                            31:51\r\n                            So, the human being who fail to glorify God, as we just said, is described as stupid and unjust and unappreciative in the Quran.\r\n                            32:01\r\n                            So...But Alhamdu Lillah, we thank God that we succeeded in making that decision with God's help.\r\n                            32:09\r\n                            On the Day of Judgment, when you review your tape, and watch this moment where you're glorifying God and praising God, and you watch the\r\n                            32:20\r\n                            the nonsense that we say throughout the day, you will be glad for this time.\r\n                            32:26\r\n                            You'll be happy that the proportion of your utterances that glorify God and praise God is a little higher than the others.\r\n                            32:35\r\n                            That will distinguish you. So, this calls for celebration.\r\n                            32:40\r\n                            (unintelligible). Celebrate.\r\n                            32:45\r\n                            Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, La Elaha Ella Allah اللهِ - اللهِ- اللهِ -اللهِ - لَآ إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ (God, God, God, God, There is no god except the One God.)\r\n                            32:54\r\n                            Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, La Elaha Ella Allah اللهِ - اللهِ- اللهِ -اللهِ - لَآ إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ (God, God, God, God, There is no god except the One God.)\r\n                            34:58\r\n                            That kind of song is a song that also commemorates God. And declares that there is no god except Him, the one God.\r\n                            Best songs are ones that commemorate God. Humans tend to make the Boss or money their God…….Highest form of Freedom is declaring God is our master.\r\n                            35:05\r\n                            For those of you who are not familiar with the word Mawlana (مولانا), our Master.\r\n                            35:11\r\n                            Some people make their job their master, their boss, their master. And those are insignificant creatures, the boss, the job, or whatever.\r\n                            35:23\r\n                            But the people, most people choose. But we choose our Master, the One who's holding the seven universes in His right hand.\r\n                            35:32\r\n                            The most Powerful, the Omnipotent, Omniscient, Omnipresent, King of the universe.\r\n                            35:38\r\n                            So in this, our national anthem, we declare that only God is our Master, which is the highest form of freedom.\r\n                            35:48\r\n                            Because no one in the world controls your life or can touch you in any way.\r\n                            35:56\r\n                            So, we're gonna chant happily our national anthem.\r\n                            36:03\r\n                            Allah, Allah, La Elaha Ella Allah, Mawlana اللهِ - اللهِ - لَآ إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ - مولانا (God, God, There is no god except the One God, our Master)\r\n                            36:11\r\n                            Allah, Allah, La Elaha Ella Allah, Mawlana اللهِ - اللهِ - لَآ إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ - مولانا (God, God, There is no god except the One God, our Master)\r\n                            37:42\r\n                            As we chant that God is our only Master, God mobilizes His forces to be with you.\r\n                            37:49\r\n                            Remember we talked about the invisible soldiers and we saw them in the Quran, written in the Quran. The invisible soldiers will be with you and help you and see that everything that you do is guided. You make an application for a job, or the immigration department, or whatever.\r\n                            God mobilizes his forces to grant ones righteous requests. Your soul could be half the size of Arizona post meditation.\r\n                            38:04\r\n                            And the application will be carried through by angels. Because you said that you are with Him.\r\n                            38:12\r\n                            Let us whisper it.

They had the literary competitions.\r\n                            1:42\r\n                            Now, the computer is a big deal, and now we have a computer miracle.\r\n                            1:48\r\n                            Computer... a miracle that is suitable for the computer age.\r\n                            1:55\r\n                            How can you divide the number that Abdullah did, when you take the number of verses\r\n                            2:03\r\n                            and put the number of each verse in every Sura in the Quran, you end up with a half-mile-long number.\r\n                            2:14\r\n                            12,692 digits. This number of digits is a multiple of the common denominator of the Quran, the number 19.\r\n                            2:24\r\n                            And also that number is a multiple of 19.\r\n                            2:30\r\n                            When the Quran was revealed, the biggest number they heard of was a thousand. That was the biggest number. Well, 50,000.\r\n                            2:36\r\n                            But then any multiples of thousand, anyway. So, how can you read this number?\r\n                            2:42\r\n                            12,692 digits. If you go to the mathematics department at the university, tell them \"read this number.\" \"Get out of here.\"\r\n                            2:54\r\n                            But it's true. The number is here, conforms to the code.\r\n                            3:02\r\n                            So, this is the computer age. You have to have a computer to know about this number.\r\n                            3:09\r\n                            I can bring you the computer printout that Abdullah wrote in. This thick papers.\r\n                            3:17\r\n                            Just solving this one problem, about this one number, dividing it into 19, and it is divisible.\r\n                            3:32\r\n                            So during the time of Thamûd, the camel was the sign.\r\n                            3:39\r\n                            During the time of Moses, he threw down the staff and it became a serpent, and swallowed the serpent, the other snakes of the magicians.\r\n                            3:48\r\n                            This is what they believed, because they realized this is no magician. They are the experts.\r\n                            4:01\r\n                            Before we go to the people of Lot, are there any questions? Number 33,\r\n                            4:08\r\n                            [54:33] The people of Lot rejected the warnings. [54:34] We showered them with rocks. Except Lot's family; we saved them at dawn.\r\n                            4:19\r\n                            [54:35] That was a blessing from us; we thus reward the appreciative.\r\n                            4:25\r\n                            [54:36] We had warned them of our strike, but they doubted the warnings.\r\n                            4:31\r\n                            [54:37] They negotiated with him about his guests; we had blinded their eyes. They have deserved my retribution and warnings.\r\n                            4:42\r\n                            [54:38] On the following morning, they were hit by devastating retribution.\r\n                            4:47\r\n                            [54:39] They have incurred my retribution and warnings. [54:40] We have made the Quran easy to remember. Is there anyone who wishes to learn?\r\n                            4:58\r\n                            So as you see consistently, the warnings, there were enough warnings followed by the retribution.\r\n                            Neglecting the Soul – Homosexuality “talk them out of it”. Divine Warnings. New translation changes “Deserved” to “Incur”.\r\n                            5:04\r\n                            So in other words, God is telling the people \"you're neglecting your souls. You're neglecting yourselves. You're going to incur retribution.\"\r\n                            5:17\r\n                            The people of Lot were wicked homosexuals.\r\n                            5:24\r\n                            You're not doing the homosexuals any favor by giving them their \"rights.\"\r\n                            5:33\r\n                            You have to talk them out of it, somehow.\r\n                            5:38\r\n                            The last 10 years, they have been demanding their rights until they got AIDS.\r\n                            5:45\r\n                            Because now you can't just take San Francisco and turn it upside down like Sodom and Gomorrah. There are many good people in San Francisco.\r\n                            5:53\r\n                            But this AIDS hits selectively the homosexuals.\r\n                            6:17\r\n                            Well, if you're doing everything right, why should you be warned?\r\n                            6:24\r\n                            Which verse is that?\r\n                            6:30\r\n                            I like \"incurred\" better than \"deserved.\" They have...\r\n                            6:38\r\n                            I don't know. I have to look it up. They have deserved my retribution and warnings.\r\n                            6:55\r\n                            Well, if you're doing everything right, you don't deserve a warning.\r\n                            7:02\r\n                            As a matter of fact, wherever you're working, you'll get a warning only before you get disciplinary action.\r\n                            7:09\r\n                            But if you're doing everything perfect, you don't get a warning, do you? Warning, you're doing everything perfect.\r\n                            7:28\r\n                            In the new translation, I'm using the word \"incurred\" in place of \"deserved.\"\r\n                            7:34\r\n                            Because we learn that people incur whatever happens to them.\r\n                            7:40\r\n                            Remember the law in the Quran, that nothing happens to you except as a consequence of your own actions?\r\n                            7:46\r\n                            Nothing happens.\r\n                            7:54\r\n                            Did you ever get a warning where you work? That there's something going...\r\n                            8:08\r\n                            It's okay. I don't care about linguistics as long as.... The warning is a negative thing.\r\n                            8:16\r\n                            Yeah, warning: you're gonna be demoted next month.\r\n                            8:21\r\n                            That's negative, you know. Unless you straighten up, you're gonna be demoted.\r\n                            8:30\r\n                            That's a negative.\r\n                            8:37\r\n                            Any other questions? This Sura is short, but it sure is full of lessons.\r\n                            8:52\r\n                            The Arabs have been warned. I can tell you right now, we're gonna witness a terrible, terrible disaster coming up to the Arabs.\r\n                            Arabs received warnings – Disaster for the Arab world.\r\n                            9:03\r\n                            Today in the mail, I just got a newspaper where they had the headlines telling them that they're not following the Quran. They received the warnings.\r\n                            9:17\r\n                            This time they didn't put my negative. They put the real picture.\r\n                            9:24\r\n                            They're calling me names and everything, but at least they didn't put the negative.\r\n                            9:34\r\n                            So, they received warnings.\r\n                            9:45\r\n                            I don't know what will happen, but the Quranic teachings point at a terrible disaster happening to the Arab world.\r\n                            9:53\r\n                            Of course, they have been incurring a lot of humiliation and problems in the last 40 years.\r\n                            10:00\r\n                            But now the warnings have been really concentrated to them.\r\n                            10:10\r\n                            They have been told that every single mosque does not uphold the commandments of the Quran, not a single one.\r\n                            10:20\r\n                            So, we'll see. Hmm? Uh-hum.\r\n                            10:27\r\n                            I just got a newspaper that is very popular there, and there's quite a prominent display of the warnings.\r\n                            10:38\r\n                            It's not the first time either.\r\n                            10:45\r\n                            Which newspaper? Warnings that the Islam they're following has nothing to do with the Quran or the Prophet Muhammad.\r\n                            10:55\r\n                            Yeah, yeah, \"(unintelligible) Al-Islam\", it's called.\r\n                            11:03\r\n                            But it's been in almost every newspaper over there.\r\n                            11:08\r\n                            It's magazines, big, the most famous magazines.\r\n                            11:14\r\n                            The average Egyptian heard about the miracle of the Quran at least, yeah.\r\n                            11:25\r\n                            Yeah. You met the wrong people.\r\n                            11:39\r\n                            It's been really intense. It's been intense.\r\n                            11:46\r\n                            Publications and the warnings, everybody heard about it, almost.\r\n                            11:53\r\n                            No, it's been in Akheru Sa'a (آخر ساعة). You know what Akheru Sa'a looks like, Rosol Yusuf. I have the copies here.\r\n                            12:02\r\n                            Al-Ahram (الأهرام), Al-Ahram, every day in Ramadan, they publish something, for the last three years.\r\n                            12:30\r\n                            Right. A woman: You know, you can also have Christians who read the Bible daily about Christ, and Christ says repeatedly in the Bible that he's the son of man.\r\n                            12:45\r\n                            A woman: The whole message in the Bible (unintelligible) There are a few distortions in the message there, but they don't get it.\r\n                            12:51\r\n                            It's probably the same thing. A woman: I just (unintelligible) distortions, you know. The more I find myself looking and rushing into them, the more I find them.\r\n                            Gospels “mostly truth”.\r\n                            13:00\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: But everything you told us, everything you mentioned, Martha....\r\n                            13:07\r\n                            Martha: The whole thing, the whole thing is about faith in Jesus Christ. We have Jesus Christ, salvation through Jesus Christ.\r\n                            13:15\r\n                            It's just I always thought it was just one or two really famous ones, like none should come to (unintelligible) without having the son of God.\r\n                            13:23\r\n                            Or else (unintelligible).\r\n                            13:31\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Well, the epistles are now..... they have a Jesus conference every year.\r\n                            13:36\r\n                            And they announced that only the first two epistles are correct, the rest are junk, they said.\r\n                            13:44\r\n                            They have no confidence in them. So, but if you look at the Gospels, look at the Gospels, the majority is truth.\r\n                            13:49\r\n                            A woman: You get 99% of Christians who'd never hear that either. A woman: same as the Muslims (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Yes, exactly.\r\n                            13:56\r\n                            A woman: They won't hear it. A woman: And (unintelligible), you know, if they heard somebody say that, they wouldn't hear it. Dr. Khalifa: They will not recognize it. Yes.\r\n                            14:02\r\n                            But it's in newspaper every year, the Jesus conference every year. In fact, these most famous statements, they declared they were fake.\r\n                            14:12\r\n                            Like Don just mentioned \"I'm the way. I'm the life and the way and this and that.\" \"None goes to the Father except through me.\" That's a fake one.\r\n                            14:20\r\n                            And this is coming out of the Christian scholars. A woman: So, if you look at the Gospels, (unintelligible) majority?\r\n                            14:29\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: 99% is truth. For example, none of them says \"Jesus son of God\" except John.\r\n                            14:36\r\n                            And in John it is only four times. John is the most recent of the four. But the other three don't say \"Jesus son of God.\"\r\n                            14:44\r\n                            A woman: (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Those are epistles.\r\n                            14:51\r\n                            They all agree that they're all fake except for the first two. If you read the book, Jesus, Lisa wrote, she gives a report on all of these.\r\n                            15:03\r\n                            Have you read that book? We have an office copy, you can get there. We'll put you in there and lock you in and have you read it.\r\n                            15:14\r\n                            Are there any questions on Jesus? They're not to be....By the way, this Sura, this is the only Sura in the Quran,\r\n                            15:24\r\n                            this is a certain piece of information on the side from the computer facts,\r\n                            15:31\r\n                            This is the only Sura in the Quran where the name of God is in every verse. At least once.\r\n                            15:38\r\n                            This Sura here, the only one in the whole Quran where every verse has the name of the word \"Allah\" in it, at least once.\r\n                            15:45\r\n                            (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Say it again. A man: 57 \"God.\" 57 times.\r\n                            15:53\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Really? Oh, my goodness. Here's another piece of information.\r\n                            (InAudible) Debate about age of 40 – “piece of information”.\r\n                            16:03\r\n                            So, these are the... It's a blessing, yes. See, what is happening\r\n                            16:10\r\n                            when there is a messenger, God is sending information to the whole group through the messenger.\r\n                            16:16\r\n                            And the messenger himself is benefiting from this information, so it will save us a lot of trouble if we obey.\r\n                            16:25\r\n                            This includes the messenger and the people because this information comes to everybody.\r\n                            16:31\r\n                            Actually, I see this in my last trip to Canada, for example.\r\n                            16:42\r\n                            I mentioned the issue of the age of 40. And I assumed that everybody accepted it.\r\n                            16:49\r\n                            But they didn't. And I ended up wasting so much time on it. And it's a blessing if the people have the understanding of, for example, this verse.\r\n                            17:00\r\n                            They'll be so comfortable if they have the conviction and understanding. They will not waste so much time arguing back and forth.\r\n                            17:08\r\n                            \"Why 40?\" \"How can a person who's 35 go to Heaven who did this and that?\"\r\n                            17:15\r\n                            It's a piece of information that God sent to us and gave us the proofs and the evidence and a number from the Quran.\r\n                            17:22\r\n                            So, a person who has, who's blessed God says \"it's a blessing because it saves us a lot of time.\r\n                            17:28\r\n                            It's finished. It's closed. When we say \"God said, up to 40, everybody goes to Heaven.\r\n                            17:35\r\n                            And here's the number in the Quran, and here are the proofs. Here are the signs.\" Then, we're convinced.\r\n                            17:40\r\n                            So, it's a blessing. So, I appreciate the fact that this verse deals specifically with disobedience to the messenger.\r\n                            17:53\r\n                            It's obedience in matters that have to do with God and information that's coming from God.\r\n                            18:00\r\n                            (unintelligible) It's not personal obedience. It's obedience to God. It is the information that's coming from God.\r\n                            18:10\r\n                            And we have, in history, the history tells us they were having a battle or something and the prophet Muhammad said \"let us camp here\"\r\n                            18:19\r\n                            and they went to him and said \"is this message from you or from God? If it's God, we'll do that.\"\r\n                            18:24\r\n                            He said \"no, it's from me.\" He said \"this is a stupid idea.\"\r\n                            18:30\r\n                            So, once he said \"it's from me\", they were free to not obey.\r\n                            18:36\r\n                            So, the obedience is really to God. This is actually written in history. They were all ready to obey you.\r\n                            18:44\r\n                            And they did move on to some other place.\r\n                            19:24\r\n                            Okay. Just we do have time for general questions.\r\n                            19:30\r\n                            \"General questions.\"\r\n                            19:42\r\n                            Now, listen to this. Are you gonna get (unintelligible)? Thank you. The word, they said that Saleh, now this is between.... the old timers will remember this.\r\n                            19:55\r\n                            They said... now Saleh, he said \"this is God's camel.\" \"Let it be, have its own drink in some places.\"\r\n                            20:04\r\n                            And then, they slaughtered the camel. So, the word, people under-aged, excuse us, but they said that they had sex with the camel.\r\n                            20:12\r\n                            (unintelligible)\r\n                            20:22\r\n                            This is what they said. They said \"the word did not mean... .\" They wanted a specific word, it means \"slaughtering.\"\r\n                            20:33\r\n                            And actually the word that's specific enough (unintelligible).\r\n                            20:39\r\n                            So, this is one of the examples of the conspiracies from the devil.\r\n                            20:44\r\n                            And they actually came back and they argued with me. They said \"why did you translate this \"they slaughtered the camel\"?\"\r\n                            20:51\r\n                            So, we really are living the Quran. Dr. Khalifa: Conspiracies from the devil. The devil gave them (unintelligible).\r\n                            20:59\r\n                            Atif: Also, the people were reading from the... They were translating from the Quran in Arabic to English. They were not using this.\r\n                            21:10\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: I think they used both, Arabic and English. They had some other translations. A man: (unintelligible).\r\n                            21:16\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yes. (Unintelligible)\r\n                            21:23\r\n                            (Unintelligible) The word is Aqaroo (7:77) عَقَرُوا۟\r\n                            21:28\r\n                            (unintelligible) It is slaughtering the camel. So the word in the Quran, what they did to the camel was slaughtering.\r\n                            21:39\r\n                            So, they said \"Aqaroo\" means \"they're having sex with the camel, not killing.\"\r\n                            21:45\r\n                            I mean, perverts.\r\n                            21:50\r\n                            That's what they are. Conspiracies of the devil. This is what happens\r\n                            21:55\r\n                            if we, if we separate ourselves from the believers. The world ends.\r\n                            22:03\r\n                            Ok, back to Robert. Robert: Especially the part that God may make room for you.\r\n                            22:09\r\n                            I thought that I was (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Actually, it's happening now with Feroz.\r\n                            22:15\r\n                            Did you find a place to sit down? Did you ask somebody to move? Did you have to ask somebody to move?\r\n                            22:22\r\n                            Feroz: No. Dr. Khalifa: Great! Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible).... that if you want, when he come in, there's nobody, ask them to make some room.\r\n                            22:31\r\n                            (unintelligible). Jack Roberts said. Edip: (unitelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Exactly.\r\n                            22:38\r\n                            Edip: Be kind to others. Dr. Khalifa: Be considerate to others. It's a general principle.\r\n                            22:45\r\n                            That is if you are nice to the people, (unintelligible) A man: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible) be kind to you...\r\n                            22:53\r\n                            If they all come and say \"no\" Don't be inconsiderate.\r\n                            23:02\r\n                            A man: Is this why they did it? Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, they allied themselves with the enemies of (unintelligible). Actually, we have some examples of these.\r\n                            23:13\r\n                            People who, for example, ally themselves by somebody who goes to the Islamic Center.\r\n                            23:23\r\n                            In the Islamic Center, they (unintelligible) the worshipers, they don't devote their prayers to God alone.\r\n                            23:31\r\n                            And you know, they anger God (unintelligible). They will not accept, La Elaha Ella Allah, (unintelligible) because they can't.\r\n                            23:46\r\n                            (unintelligible) They're criticizing me for saying that (unintelligible) to have the freedom of expression.\r\n                            23:55\r\n                            And in that letter they say \"we agree to admire, we applaud the Catholic Church for making a stand against Salman Rushdie.\r\n                            24:07\r\n                            (unintelligible) They're attacking me and applauding the Catholic Church.\r\n                            24:15\r\n                            I say \"La Elaha Ella Allah.\" The Catholic Church says \"praise Mary, mother of God.\"\r\n                            24:23\r\n                            So, it is not an issue of worshipping God. It's politics.\r\n                            24:28\r\n                            How can they applaud the Catholic Church for anything? Because the Catholic Church itself practiced the same thing that (unintelligible).\r\n                            24:35\r\n                            They don't like people to write about their \"Shroud of Turin\" and all the nonsense that they have.\r\n                            24:42\r\n                            They have (unintelligible) censorship. They excommunicate people right and left because of their opinions.\r\n                            24:50\r\n                            So, they are (unintelligible).\r\n                            24:58\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Right. And the Catholics... A woman: (unintelligible).\r\n                            25:08\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: You can see how will God look at people with this, applauding people who are saying \"praise Mary, mother of God.\"\r\n                            25:19\r\n                            (unintelligible) Mary, mother of God.\r\n                            25:24\r\n                            And condemning somebody who says \"La Elaha Ella Allah.\"\r\n                            25:30\r\n                            So, anybody who allies himself with those people, God is angry with them.\r\n                            25:35\r\n                            This is verse 15. [58:15] GOD has prepared for them a severe retribution. Miserable indeed is what they used to do.\r\n                            25:41\r\n                            Robert: (unintelligible) there are those who ally themselves with people who have angered God.\r\n                            25:53\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: We seek refuge in God from Satan. Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem. In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.\r\n                            26:02\r\n                            Tonight, we're starting at Sura 54. 55, excuse me.\r\n                            26:09\r\n                            And our teacher tonight will be Lori, right? But before we start, I want to make some corrections.\r\n                            26:16\r\n                            In my Khutba today, I make some boo-boos sometimes. Sometimes I say things that appear to be not very tactful.\r\n                            26:25\r\n                            For example, we have, here, a great team of cake bringers and cake makers and when I asked, and Rahima was\r\n                            26:33\r\n                            Rahima's turn, Lori's turn, I said the best. So, this... they're all, they're all great makers of cake, bringers of cake.\r\n                            26:42\r\n                            And this appears not to be tactful, but I had to explain to you that each believer is the best.\r\n                            26:49\r\n                            So when I say the best, I'm referring to every single one of them.\r\n                            26:55\r\n                            Because we're all, I hope I don't make it worse. No, honestly, I...\r\n                            27:02\r\n                            Because you people are so special that every one of you is the best. And when I say that, I just want to pay you the highest possible compliment without infringing on the other's properties.\r\n                            27:18\r\n                            Because they are the best, each one of them.\r\n                            27:26\r\n                            Every single... Did I describe your cake as the best when you brought it in?\r\n                            27:36\r\n                            Now, how do I get out of this one? Help! I think I get out by saying \"okay, take it over, Lori.\"\r\n                            27:49\r\n                            Lori: It was really a test for me, because I just wanted to know. And I never understood the jinns. It's just like...\r\n                            27:55\r\n                            You know, I read it, and I knew because it was in the Quran, I had to believe it.\r\n                            28:01\r\n                            But I didn't know what they were, and nobody could explain it to me. You know, and I got really wild explanations of what the jinns were.\r\n                            28:11\r\n                            And it always troubled me, but I just forced myself to submit. And in the second chapter of the Quran where it says that the believers are those who believe in the unseen, and this was part of the unseen.\r\n                            28:26\r\n                            And I knew that, IN SHAA ALLAH, at the time, that God would explain it to me.\r\n                            28:32\r\n                            And one of the blessings of being in this mosque is having things explained to us.\r\n                            28:37\r\n                            And as Rashad said in the Khutba today \"it's the mercy from God that He sends a messenger from among us to explain to us.\"\r\n                            28:45\r\n                            The knowledge is here in the Quran, and all of us have read the Quran. You know, I read it once a month from front to back, and every time there's something new.\r\n                            28:54\r\n                            And we get what we need at the time we need it.\r\n                            29:00\r\n                            And we, in this mosque, are just developing so far. It's just amazing. You know, Rashad and Lisa and Hasan went to Canada, and there where the people believed the way we do,\r\n                            29:10\r\n                            there's still (unintelligible) behind us in the knowledge, because we're here every Friday night, learning and studying.\r\n                            29:16\r\n                            We have the input of all these believers here and learning and studying. We have the input of all these believers here.\r\n                            29:24\r\n                            And we have a messenger that is given the knowledge that is passed on to us.\r\n                            29:29\r\n                            Lori: And we're responsible for the information in this mosque. Dr. Khalifa: This was directed to the humans and the jinns.\r\n                            29:35\r\n                            Well, there were two kinds of creatures, creatures that sided with Satan completely, the jinns,\r\n                            29:44\r\n                            and the creatures that did not... they were neutral, didn't make a stand with God. That's you and me.\r\n                            29:51\r\n                            God decided to give us the body of man, originally of the same material as the earth.\r\n                            29:59\r\n                            We are earth now. But the jinns have a body of fire, fire. It's the difference.\r\n                            Satan and jinn’s invisible to us so they can whisper – Jinn’s travel faster than speed of light. Jinns given a chance to see more of the universe.\r\n                            30:06\r\n                            We are in dimensions and they are in different dimensions. Because the agreement called for Satan to remain invisible, just like God is invisible.\r\n                            30:15\r\n                            Satan wanted to whisper to us while being invisible.\r\n                            30:21\r\n                            Therefore, they had to be made of a different material in a different dimension. Also, the jinns, they're made from energy. It gives them the abilities to travel a lot faster than the speed of light, millions of times the speed of light.\r\n                            30:38\r\n                            They can go to the outer limit of our universe, 26 billion light years.\r\n                            30:44\r\n                            So, this gives them more to see, more evidence. God is giving them more evidence because they made a hard stand against God.\r\n                            30:55\r\n                            So, when they go to Hell in the Hereafter, it seems like this whole life is really to nullify the excuses\r\n                            31:06\r\n                            of the humans and the jinns, the creatures who did not make a firm stand on God's absolute authority.\r\n                            31:15\r\n                            In other words, had God listened to the angels initially and said \"okay, all those who didn't make a stand\r\n                            31:22\r\n                            on My absolute authority are banished, are out. Go to Hell\", they would have said \"oh, you didn't give us another chance. We didn't know how bad Hell is. You didn't give us warnings.\"\r\n                            31:34\r\n                            So, this life is designed so that when the people insist, that the jinns insist on going to Hell, they will not be able to say that.\r\n                            31:43\r\n                            They will not be able to say \"you didn't give us a chance. You didn't give us warnings. We didn't know what we were doing.\r\n                            31:51\r\n                            If You told us how bad it is here in Hell, we would have made a difference.\" God told us everything, the humans and the jinns.\r\n                            31:58\r\n                            He told us how bad Hell is, how to get out of it, how to redeem ourselves, how to make it back to God's kingdom.\r\n                            32:06\r\n                            So, the jinns, because they have this strong stand, they are given a chance to see more of the universe.\r\n                            32:14\r\n                            And to convince them to redeem themselves. We were wishy-washy and this is the extent that we need to make that decision and to redeem ourselves.\r\n                            32:26\r\n                            We have these different bodies. A woman: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: This is it.\r\n                            32:33\r\n                            A woman: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Of course. Dr. Khalifa: We have....In the museum, there was one show on the Friday show before the elections. (unintelligible).\r\n                            32:47\r\n                            And they had this magician, a fellow who uses jinns, I'm sure.\r\n                            32:52\r\n                            And before the elections, two weeks before the elections, on the show, they decided to put, he said \"I'm going to put in this envelope\r\n                            33:02\r\n                            who's going to win the elections and how many votes.\" And he sealed the envelope. That was two weeks before the elections.\r\n                            33:10\r\n                            And he said \"on the election day, the next day, they would open the envelope and they would see\r\n                            33:16\r\n                            that he wrote down two weeks back, two weeks ago, who won the elections and how many votes.\"\r\n                            33:23\r\n                            How would he do that? Can you guess? What did they do? A woman: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: No. A woman: So, what did they do?\r\n                            33:33\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Ok. They don't know the future. The jinns don't know the future. They're just like us. But what they did, they waited until the newspaper came out and they said \"Reagan won and here are the number of votes.\" Then, they go in the envelope and they write.\r\n                            33:46\r\n                            That's right. That's how they do it. Because this is the number of votes.\r\n                            33:52\r\n                            So, what I'm saying, what I'm saying is they go into envelope (unintelligible). A woman: But tell me this now...\r\n                            33:58\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible). A woman: On the news, they showed pictures of Mars and this is why they said that the Russians (unintelligible).\r\n                            34:05\r\n                            And they found two faces on Mars and they thought it was a shadow.\r\n                            34:10\r\n                            So, they did a close-up and then they did a computer enhancement and saw teeth.\r\n                            34:16\r\n                            The eyes and the teeth, they understood. Dr. Khalifa: No. A woman: I'm thinking about it (unintelligible) about Rashad\r\n                            34:24\r\n                            Rashad said \"the jinns went there because they can leave early (unintelligible). Right and they can go up there and plant these things for us to see. And they prove to us (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: No.\r\n                            34:35\r\n                            And while we're busy worrying about this little thing on Mars, they sneak up, you know what I'm saying?\r\n                            34:41\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: They have (unintelligible). They cannot do anything without God's will. So, if God wants us to be fooled in that way, He will allow it.\r\n                            34:50\r\n                            But they cannot slap you in the face, for example. They're sitting there and (unintelligible). First of all, each one of us has one.\r\n                            34:58\r\n                            Those are not free yet. And then, there are the ones that have been freed of the dead people, our grandparents.\r\n                            35:06\r\n                            They come here regularly and listen to Quranic studies. It is recorded in the (unintelligible). There's a person that says \"some jinns heard the Quran and went to their families and friends and told them \"we heard a wonderful Quran.\"\"\r\n                            35:24\r\n                            So, this is one. We have this kind of body and the jinns that kind of body.\r\n                            35:30\r\n                            (unintelligible). This says \"use me, O Lord, in Thy work.\"\r\n                            35:38\r\n                            And in parentheses, especially, in an advisory capacity.\r\n                            35:46\r\n                            Okay, anything else? There was something here about death. I want you to think of death as getting rid of this lousy body\r\n                            35:56\r\n                            and getting a new body that does not get sick or die. That's what death is, smooth from stage to stage.\r\n                            36:05\r\n                            And usually it happens when you're sick and tired of this one. And you want a new one.\r\n                            36:28\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible). You see, the balance in number seven can be understood by different generations, but now we understand the environmental balance, for example.\r\n                            36:39\r\n                            Why do we have so many rabbits? What do they reproduce so much? The wilderness.\r\n                            36:45\r\n                            You see, the foxes need food. There's an environmental balance. Foxes.... The coyotes did not need the rabbits to be invaded.\r\n                            36:54\r\n                            There are hundreds of rabbits right here. So, I mean, this is a type of balance, well known.\r\n                            “Cheating cost you a lot” – new heaven new Earth in the Bible.\r\n                            37:02\r\n                            It was studied in school. (unintelligible) that there was some biological balance in the world.\r\n                            37:09\r\n                            But this balance covers everything.\r\n                            37:16\r\n                            And worrying has to do with cheating. It's a very important commandment. So,\r\n                            37:21\r\n                            Prophet Shu‘aib was sent just for that particular commandment, not to cheat in trading.\r\n                            37:29\r\n                            When we break this commandment, it costs us a lot.\r\n                            37:35\r\n                            You cheat in paying your rent, collecting your rent, doing your work, or whatever, it will cost you a lot, more than you cheat.\r\n                            37:50\r\n                            So, this is God's commandment. It's one of the very important commandments. I believe what is an ideal person in honesty and truthfulness.\r\n                            38:07\r\n                            Okay, if there are no questions, we'll go to 37.\r\n                            38:13\r\n                            A woman: What would that mean? Dr. Khalifa: The sky is blue now, right? A woman: Right.\r\n                            38:18\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: So, the Hereafter will be pink, will be rosy. It will be almost like Cherie's blouse, a little lighter.\r\n                            38:27\r\n                            With a beautiful sky at the sunset or the sunrise. So, they studied (unintelligible).\r\n                            38:35\r\n                            Psychologists, psychiatrists said that the most peaceful color is this, this color\r\n                            38:40\r\n                            In fact, they suggested that people who are tense to get a piece of this color (unintelligible) for a couple of minutes.\r\n                            38:47\r\n                            The sky will be like that on the Day of Judgement.\r\n                            38:56\r\n                            By the way, Laurie mentioned substitution of the earth with a new earth, the heavens with the new heavens\r\n                            39:04\r\n                            And we see this in the Old Testament and the New Testament as well. Most of the prophecies, in the Old Testament, are in the book of Isaiah.\r\n                            39:12\r\n                            And if you want to put this (unintelligible) and put down Isaiah 65:22, it talks about substitution of a new heaven, a new earth.\r\n                            39:22\r\n                            65:22 Isaiah. Also, in 66:7.\r\n                            39:29\r\n                            66:7 That's the very end of the book of Isaiah.\r\n                            39:34\r\n                            And also in the New Testament, you find it in the second book of Peter 3:13.\r\n                            39:40\r\n                            3, the verse number is 13. Both of them talk about substitution of a new heaven, new earth.\r\n                            39:49\r\n                            The Quran and the Old Testament. The Old Testament and the New Testament and the Final Testament are identical in that respect.\r\n                            39:58\r\n                            This is, this is one fact that God wants you to know. On the Day of Judgement, the color of the sky is going to be rosy.\r\n                            40:16\r\n                            Is this something about Mars?\r\n                            40:23\r\n                            I remember one of the cameras that went to Mars (unintelligible).\r\n                            40:33\r\n                            You know, the reason our sky is blue is the diffraction of the light. You know, (unintelligible).\r\n                            40:42\r\n                            And the blue happens to hit the atmosphere of the earth at such an angle that it gets deflected.\r\n                            40:48\r\n                            (unintelligible) So, this is God's design.\r\n                            40:53\r\n                            So, it's blue. Now if the... If the sunlight becomes a little, changes just the angle hitting the atmosphere, some other color will be deflected.\r\n                            41:03\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: It's a very simple matter. A man: The reason we see the sunset as being pinkish or red is because of the sun (unintelligible)....\r\n                            41:17\r\n                            A man: .... that it's the reflection of the sun (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Right.\r\n                            41:22\r\n                            A man: And say, you know, (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Also, the deflection is different, at sunrise and sunset.\r\n                            41:31\r\n                            I'm glad you brought this up. There's a deflection and reflection and diffraction.\r\n                            41:42\r\n                            When you go fishing and you put a stick in the water, you see the stick go like this.\r\n                            41:49\r\n                            It's a great stick, but you can see it's called...\r\n                            41:54\r\n                            I forget now (unintelligible), reflection, diffraction and all those terms.\r\n                            42:00\r\n                            But the sunlight hits the earth atmosphere and this happens to it. It depends on which angle, which light (unintelligible) This is what changes the colors.\r\n                            42:11\r\n                            So anyway, one of the things that God wants us to know is that the sky is rosy.\r\n                            42:17\r\n                            It's very pleasant only to the believers, pleasant to the believers.\r\n                            42:26\r\n                            Laurie: In verse 39, we're told that on the Day of Resurrection that neither jinns nor humans will be asked about their sins because it won't be necessary.\r\n                            42:37\r\n                            We know from other verses in the Quran that everything that we've done in our lifetime has been reported\r\n                            42:43\r\n                            by reporters that are honest and never miss anything at all. And it's recorded and we know now with the development of the videotape that that's what it's going to be like.\r\n                            42:56\r\n                            We can see everything exactly as it was as it took place. Everything we said, all the thoughts that we had, everything we did will be recorded.\r\n                            43:05\r\n                            And for those of us who are fortunate enough to have developed our souls to the extent that we're worthy of having our sins remitted, we'll have the power to edit our tapes, which will be so nice.\r\n                            43:17\r\n                            And everybody else won't. And we've been told in many verses in the Quran that we don't have to even...\r\n                            43:24\r\n                            We won't even be asked about our sins because everything will testify to them, our skin, you know, everything will...\r\n                            43:31\r\n                            We've been reporting everything that we've done all this time. A man: (unintelligible)\r\n                            43:41\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: I don't know if he knows that. (unintelligible).\r\n                            43:47\r\n                            See verse 40 says, well, 39...\r\n                            43:55\r\n                            Verse (unintelligible) \"We won't be asked...\" Oh, 39, yeah.\r\n                            Size of the soul on day of Judgement.\r\n                            44:00\r\n                            [55:39] Humans or the jinns will not be asked for their sins. Nobody will need to ask anybody about anything because the believers develop their souls\r\n                            44:11\r\n                            and the disbelievers fail to develop their souls. And in Sura 17, we're told that the differences in the Hereafter, I mean...\r\n                            44:19\r\n                            In this room, the differences in our sizes are within a few inches. But in the Hereafter, the differences will be like the difference between a mouse and the city of New York, city of Tucson, let's say.\r\n                            44:31\r\n                            So, when you see somebody the size of the city of Tucson, he or she has developed the soul sufficiently.\r\n                            44:39\r\n                            This is why they will be able to come closer to God. When you see somebody the size of a mouse, you don't need to ask, you know \"what did you do wrong?\"\r\n                            44:48\r\n                            You know, that is... This is why nobody will need to ask anybody for their sins.\r\n                            44:54\r\n                            It is so obvious. There'll be no question. Also in Sura 17, we're told that everybody will be the judge for him or herself for the sins.\r\n                            45:04\r\n                            Because in that dimension, we will see what we really look like, how much we really develop, and how much we lack development.\r\n                            45:15\r\n                            So, 41, [55:41] The guilty will be recognized by their looks;...\r\n                            45:20\r\n                            They'll be undeveloped. They'll be shrunken. It's like being born without arms and legs, deformed.\r\n                            45:28\r\n                            They will be born into the Hereafter deformed, undeveloped, aborted.\r\n                            45:36\r\n                            But they'll be alive. They will (unintelligible). Very alive, Not well.\r\n                            45:46\r\n                            Also, God lets us understand, as Laurie explained about 44, how they will try to sneak into Heaven and they'll find it worse than Hell.\r\n                            45:57\r\n                            They will sneak into the Lower Heaven. They'll find it worse than Hell, because they do not stand to come any closer to God.\r\n                            46:08\r\n                            See, God takes it completely up to us, completely. This is why God does not inflict an atom's weight of injustice.\r\n                            46:15\r\n                            It's absolutely up to you. You can be as close to God as you want in the High Heaven, or you can be as far from God as you want.\r\n                            46:25\r\n                            It's completely up to us. So, the conclusion is that God does not put a single person in Hell.\r\n                            46:32\r\n                            It is the people who insist or choose, and they insist on going to Hell.\r\n                            46:38\r\n                            The whole thing will be automatic in the Hereafter. This is why it is important to do, for example, the five Prayers a day.\r\n                            46:47\r\n                            You don't do the five Prayers every day, you are in trouble. That's the minimum that you can do.\r\n                            46:54\r\n                            Because those are the meals for the real person.\r\n                            47:00\r\n                            Just imagine if you don't feed... your body is dry and you don't feed it and run for two months.\r\n                            47:05\r\n                            What will your body look like? There is no death in the Hereafter.\r\n                            47:11\r\n                            Just imagine not eating for two months. And the people out there in the street, they don't feed their soul for years and years and years.\r\n                            47:22\r\n                            Can you imagine what they look like? Can you imagine what they look like? Just bring it to our dimension here and think of bodies that didn't eat for years.\r\n                            47:32\r\n                            You see those skeletal pictures of the starving people in Central Africa, Ethiopia, Sudan?\r\n                            47:39\r\n                            What do they look like? You can see their ribs, the shank, the skin and bones.\r\n                            47:46\r\n                            And this happens to the soul. The soul is not fed. The body eats every day.\r\n                            47:54\r\n                            [55:41] The guilty will be recognized by their looks;....\r\n                            48:02\r\n                            You can tell who is starving in Africa and who is not by looking at them.\r\n                            48:08\r\n                            In the Hereafter, you'll be able to know who is starving and who is not.\r\n                            48:14\r\n                            Except it will be by choice. Dr. Khalifa: So, now I'll go back to Laurie and number 46, the Higher Heaven. Laurie: Yes.\r\n                            48:24\r\n                            Laurie: [55:46] For those who reverence the glory of their Lord, there will be two Paradises. [55:47] Which of your Lord's marvels can you deny?\r\n                            48:31\r\n                            [55:48] With abundant vegetation. [55:49] Which of your Lord's marvels can you deny? [55:50] Two springs run freely therein.\r\n                            48:39\r\n                            [55:51] Which of your Lord's marvels can you deny? [55:52] They will have two kinds of every fruit. [55:53] Which of your Lord's marvels can you deny?\r\n                            48:46\r\n                            [55:54] They will relax on furnishings lined with silk, while the fruits of the two gardens are brought near.\r\n                            48:51\r\n                            [55:55] Which of your Lord's marvels can you deny? [55:56] They will have magnificent spouses therein, never before touched by any human or jinn.\r\n                            History of Abrahamic/Islamic/Submission faith. “Special People”, Persecution, MOC says “disown me if you go to the Middle East”. Believers ridiculed. Early Generation.\r\n                            49:00\r\n                            [55:57] Which of your Lord's marvels can you deny? [55:58] They will look like gems and coral.\r\n                            49:05\r\n                            [55:59] Which of your Lord's marvels can you deny?

Dr. Khalifa: Verse 13, I have some very good news for you.\r\n                            49:26\r\n                            I'm not flattering you. You are very, very special people. You've got to go to the Highest, Highest, Highest Heaven. I'm gonna explain to you why.\r\n                            49:36\r\n                            When Abraham started the religion of Islam, according to God's instructions, he and the people around him were worshipping God alone.\r\n                            49:48\r\n                            And as time went by, Satan sneakily and gradually added idol worship until the time of Muhammad came.\r\n                            49:58\r\n                            Some centuries later, by the time Muhammad came, they were worshipping lots of idols,\r\n                            50:06\r\n                            Allaat, Manaat, Al-‘Uzzah and all that. They were in the Ka‘bah that Abraham built.\r\n                            50:12\r\n                            And you've read how many verses in Quran that say \"Abraham was never an idol worshipper.\" And yet there is the Ka‘bah that he built that was full of idols.\r\n                            50:21\r\n                            And then, God renewed the message, sent the Quran to Muhammad, and sent Muhammad to tell the people \"the idols are bad. Worship God alone. Worship God alone.\" So, what happened?\r\n                            50:32\r\n                            Now, Muhammad and his company were persecuted severely. They threw on them all kinds of dirt and bones.\r\n                            50:42\r\n                            Then, they banished them when they grew. There were about 10 or 15 people for about 3 years.\r\n                            50:49\r\n                            Then, they grew to about maybe 25 or 30 people. Then, they thought they were getting too strong. So, they banished them out of Mecca, boycotted them.\r\n                            50:59\r\n                            Now, and those people were abused. So, those have to have a special place in Heaven.\r\n                            51:08\r\n                            They went against the current. They were worshipping God alone in an ocean of idolatry.\r\n                            51:14\r\n                            You can easily see that they are very special people. They will be in the highest place in the High Heaven.\r\n                            51:21\r\n                            Because even within the High Heaven and the Low Heaven, there'll be ranks. Ok, now, 20 years ago, you see how it says here \"few from the later generations,\" the later generations after Muhammad.\r\n                            51:37\r\n                            1400 years after Muhammad, there is not a single mosque in the Muslim world that was worshipping God alone.\r\n                            51:44\r\n                            That is upholding the commandment \"the mosque belongs to God. You shall not mention other names with God.\"\r\n                            51:54\r\n                            And then God renewed the message, right now.\r\n                            51:59\r\n                            And the message went loud and clear, ringing throughout the whole world \"worship God alone. Say \"La Elaha Ella Allah\"\",\r\n                            52:05\r\n                            not \"La Elaha Ella Allah Muhammad Rasulallah.\" And \"devote yourself to God alone. Uphold the commandments of the Quran. Purify your worship. Your Prayer is wrong,\r\n                            52:15\r\n                            Your fasting is wrong. Your Zakat is wrong.\" These are, these are all blessings from God that He sent to our generation.\r\n                            52:24\r\n                            And again, we are subject to the same persecution, the same ridicule, lucky us.\r\n                            52:34\r\n                            Yours truly cannot go into any country in the Middle East. I'll be shot within 24 hours.\r\n                            52:41\r\n                            Just stabilize it. And if you go to the Middle East, you better disown me. I'm asking you to do that.\r\n                            52:47\r\n                            I mean, God says, even disown God, if you are under those circumstances, as long as your heart is filled with faith.\r\n                            52:54\r\n                            If you don't wanna get into trouble, you better tell them \"I don't know Rashad Khalifa\" on purpose. But this is... you are very, very special people.\r\n                            53:05\r\n                            You've gone through the mill of ridicule and mocking.\r\n                            53:11\r\n                            Today, Tasneem calls you from New York, and she was talking to some relatives of her in Chicago, who are very active in the so-called Islamic Center.\r\n                            53:19\r\n                            And she told them \"I'm devoting myself to God alone. I only say \"La Elaha Ella Allah.\"\r\n                            53:25\r\n                            And guess what they said? They said \"Tasneem went to the dogs.\" She's worshiping God alone.\r\n                            53:32\r\n                            I mean, this is ridicule, right? They ridiculed her. You know, you're saying \"La Elaha Ella Allah.\" You're saying \"worship God alone.\"\r\n                            53:40\r\n                            \"You mean, God alone. That's all you have, God?\" I mean, do you see the logic? They're ridiculing her.\r\n                            53:47\r\n                            Mahmood was working the other night, and some so-called Muslims walked in the store.\r\n                            53:53\r\n                            And they saw the label, it says \"Muhammad\" on Mahmood, on the label. They said \"are you a Muslim?\" He said \"yes.\"\r\n                            53:59\r\n                            They said \"how come we don't see you at the mosque?\" He said \"how come I don't see you at the mosque?\"\r\n                            54:08\r\n                            So, they said \"oh, you mean, you go to that mosque?\" Because the mosque that worships God alone, right?\r\n                            54:15\r\n                            Now, Noah, if you remember in the Quran, Noah said, cause Noah was building the ark, with the\r\n                            54:21\r\n                            flat, float, whatever you call it, water raft.\r\n                            54:28\r\n                            And they were laughing at him. And he told them, he said \"you're laughing at me, but I'm really laughing at you.\" And that's what Mahmood was actually doing in the store.\r\n                            54:35\r\n                            Because they said \"oh, we never believed in mathematics. A woman: Oh, God.\r\n                            54:42\r\n                            Now, on that day, they probably had an exam in calculus, right? In university.\r\n                            54:48\r\n                            And they had to follow the formulas and the equations, and otherwise they would flunk.\r\n                            54:55\r\n                            So, they believe in mathematics. But if it comes to God and the Quran, and worshiping God alone, they don't believe in mathematics.\r\n                            55:02\r\n                            So, they were looking at Mahmood, you know, ridiculing him, and of course, in his heart, he knows \"fool souls.\"\r\n                            55:08\r\n                            Just like Noah, he was ridiculing them. Just like, I mean, he was laughing at them, just like they were laughing at him.\r\n                            55:15\r\n                            But this makes Mahmood a very special person. This is what it means, \"multitudes from the early generations.\"\r\n                            55:24\r\n                            We are the first generation of renewing the message. And we see it very clearly. Every one of us is in the light, and we can see it.\r\n                            55:35\r\n                            Just go in any mosque in the world and say \"La Elaha Ella Allah,\" they will beat you up.\r\n                            55:41\r\n                            You are saying \"worship God alone.\" So, you can see what happens after centuries, from the first generation.\r\n                            55:51\r\n                            Abraham was a first generation. And those people, I mean, they threw Abraham in the fire, right?\r\n                            56:00\r\n                            In those days, there was no America for Abraham to run to.\r\n                            56:05\r\n                            They threw him in the fire, so what did God do? He turned the fire into a cool and safe place.\r\n                            56:12\r\n                            Because God, God says \"do not think that I will abandon my messengers.\r\n                            56:17\r\n                            God creates exits for them. So, the exit for Abraham was a cool and safe fire.\r\n                            56:23\r\n                            And the people who were with him, they were persecuted. They had to be special people, because the easiest thing is to go along with the masses, with the crowds.\r\n                            56:34\r\n                            You think this shook Mahmood? Not one hair. And this is why he is very special.\r\n                            56:40\r\n                            I'm just using Mahmood as an example. Muhtesem went to a grocery store to buy some Middle Eastern stuff.\r\n                            56:47\r\n                            And he met some Arabs there.\r\n                            56:52\r\n                            They're just totally ignorant. They know nothing. But he says \"yes, we saw too much in Tucson. We worship God alone.\"\r\n                            57:00\r\n                            And they almost beat him up. If he wasn't big enough and strong enough.\r\n                            57:06\r\n                            And a Turk. He would have been beaten. So, why do you have to take all this abuse?\r\n                            57:13\r\n                            And all this ridicule. Do you think it shook him up? Did it affect his faith?\r\n                            57:18\r\n                            If anything, it strengthened his faith. Because he knows that those people are off. He knows they're ignorant.\r\n                            57:24\r\n                            He knows they're not worshipping God alone. He knows they lost the Prayer. They probably never prayed.\r\n                            57:29\r\n                            These people, do you think they prayed? Muhtesem: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Right. Right. They don't know?\r\n                            57:38\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: They don't know? Muhtesem: (unintelligible)\r\n                            57:52\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: And they don't know how many stories are in the Quran. Muhtesem: (unintelligible) Muhtesem: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: All of them. They're missing this.\r\n                            57:58\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: The Bashar couple. The Bashar's, they ridiculed them so many times.\r\n                            58:05\r\n                            \"Do you really go to that mosque?\" And the answer is \"show me a place where they worship God alone that I go.\"\r\n                            58:14\r\n                            \"We go to that place.\" I will go to that place. Any place where they worship God alone, we'll go.\r\n                            58:20\r\n                            God is the One (unintelligible). God is the One who created you. God is the one who provides for you.\r\n                            58:26\r\n                            God is the One who controls your health, your welfare.\r\n                            58:31\r\n                            God is the One who controls your happiness. God is the only One who controls your success.\r\n                            58:37\r\n                            Muhammad is dead. The saints are dead. Jesus is dead. Powerless. Even when they were alive. They had absolutely no power.\r\n                            58:49\r\n                            So, (unintelligible). Because you are going through. This is the first generation. We are,\r\n                            58:57\r\n                            We are so lucky. We are a first generation, just like Abraham's generation, Muhammad's generation.\r\n                            People who follow the crowd “jumping on the wagon” of an established belief. Believers get a pinch when they stray off the path.\r\n                            59:05\r\n                            Muhammad's generation are ones who went through the ridicule, the abuse. And they had to leave their city, Mecca and go to Medina.\r\n                            59:12\r\n                            The persecution they went through. Because of this, God reserves a special place for them.\r\n                            59:18\r\n                            God is reserving a special place for us. I'm saying it by God's grace.\r\n                            59:23\r\n                            So, I have this very good news for you. What you are, you fit here in verse 13. Multitude from the early generations.\r\n                            59:31\r\n                            In 50 years, I assure you, in 50 years, there'll be millions of people worshipping God alone, upholding the Quran alone and praying the correct way.\r\n                            59:40\r\n                            Millions. In just 50 years. But they will be following the crowd.\r\n                            59:46\r\n                            They cannot be like you. They will be protected by their numbers.\r\n                            59:53\r\n                            Right at this location, right here, there'll be thousands on this block, in this mosque.\r\n                            59:59\r\n                            And there'll be powerful, the people jumping on the wagons. But they don't deserve the same position or the same credit as you.\r\n                            1:00:12\r\n                            So, this is what it means. \"Multitude from the early generations, but only a few from the last generations.\"\r\n                            1:00:19\r\n                            Because these are the far ahead, in Arabic, (56:10) ٱلسَّـٰبِقُونَ ٱلسَّـٰبِقُونَ These will be the closest to God. They are very special.\r\n                            1:00:27\r\n                            And that is you. And you start collecting benefits now.\r\n                            1:00:34\r\n                            And we've seen it. We have a history already. We have a track record in this mosque for 10 years.\r\n                            1:00:39\r\n                            We have a track record, a perfect track record. In this life.\r\n                            1:00:45\r\n                            It's guaranteed by God. You may have a pinch here and there, but it's because we make mistakes.\r\n                            1:00:54\r\n                            The tests are brief for you. But if you stray off the path, you know you're gonna get the pinch.\r\n                            “Angels have wings 2, 3 and 4”. Those who except ridicule and persecution for their belief are special people and attain the high ranks. Satan hates you.\r\n                            1:01:01\r\n                            And you get the pinch and say \"thank You, God\", and come back to the path. You are very special people.\r\n                            1:01:10\r\n                            You deserve a lot of congratulations. God says in Sura 35 that the angels have wings, two, three, and four.\r\n                            1:01:20\r\n                            Two, three, and four, because the angels closest to God will be the most powerful, the highest in rank.\r\n                            1:01:29\r\n                            You'll have more wings. This is figuratively speaking. And these (56:10) ٱلسَّـٰبِقُونَ ٱلسَّـٰبِقُونَ\r\n                            1:01:36\r\n                            these far ahead people. Like (unintelligible), you'll be there.\r\n                            1:01:41\r\n                            I mean, all those are angels, but still, they have ranks. And 50 years from now, the thousands of people will be in this location, IN SHAA ALLAH. They will go to the High Heaven because they worship God alone\r\n                            1:01:54\r\n                            and they will pray the correct way. And they'll go to the High Heaven, but they cannot attain your rank, because you're the ones who are taking the abuse.\r\n                            1:02:02\r\n                            The people who take the abuse and the ridicule have a very special position in the Bible and in the Quran.\r\n                            1:02:09\r\n                            I had a little thing that I hang in there for a while that says \"congratulations to those who are persecuted.\"\r\n                            1:02:15\r\n                            Well, the prophets also have been persecuted, remember that verse? I had it hanging here.\r\n                            1:02:21\r\n                            And this is God telling you \"congratulations.\" (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:02:27\r\n                            So, we are very, very lucky. And I'm stressing, I keep stressing this, because I cannot stress it enough.\r\n                            1:02:36\r\n                            Just so we can thank God and be appreciative, so you know who you are.\r\n                            1:02:42\r\n                            Satan will always put doubts in your mind. Always will tell you \"you're nobody.\" He hates your guts, okay?\r\n                            1:02:51\r\n                            Because it's going to be deep, deep in Hell. You hear that, Iman? You're asking about Satan and the Hereafter?\r\n                            1:02:57\r\n                            He will not be in Heaven, no. He will not even come close. He and his troops will be way deep down in the lowest pit of Hell.\r\n                            1:03:08\r\n                            And he'll be beating them and they'll be beating him. They're gonna spend eternity doing that.\r\n                            1:03:16\r\n                            So, he will try to tell you \"you're a nobody\", but you speak back to him.\r\n                            1:03:21\r\n                            You tell him \"I believe God.\" And I believe that I am in this group, multitudes in the early generations.\r\n                            1:03:27\r\n                            Because this is a first generation.\r\n                            1:03:32\r\n                            I mean, I couldn't believe it myself. For a long time just \"it couldn't be just us here worshipping God alone. There must be millions in the world.\"\r\n                            1:03:41\r\n                            But I discovered that I'm naive, that the human being is really bad.\r\n                            1:03:46\r\n                            I was talking to my nephew, Sharif, in Egypt. He said \"I'm the only one in Egypt.\"\r\n                            1:03:53\r\n                            He really is a believer. You can tell the people who believe, because they are in the light. They understand.\r\n                            1:04:02\r\n                            And he's the only one that I know in Egypt, (unintelligible). He said \"really, I believe.\"\r\n                            1:04:08\r\n                            IN SHAA ALLAH, he will come for the conference. He's only 20.\r\n                            1:04:16\r\n                            He was born two weeks before Beth. And he's the only believer in all of Egypt.\r\n                            1:04:25\r\n                            I mean, I was really naive. I mean, I said \"there must be millions in Egypt to worship God alone.\" Nope.\r\n                            1:04:32\r\n                            Wrong. So, this is why I'm speaking so strongly. And I'm telling you \"you're very special.\" And when Satan tells you \"you're not\", you tell him to shut up.\r\n                            1:04:43\r\n                            You're very special This is the verse that talks about you.\r\n                            1:04:49\r\n                            Congratulations. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Dr. Sabahi: (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:04:55\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: At this time Dr. Khalifa: At this time, right now. Dr. Khalifa: refers Muhammad's time, Ibrahim's time, and this time, our time. We are a first generation.\r\n                            1:05:05\r\n                            Right now. Because we are the fortunate generation that is renewing God's message, restoring it, cleaning out all the junk and innovations.\r\n                            1:05:16\r\n                            When you go back to Iran you'll be, which town will you be in? Tehran?\r\n                            1:05:25\r\n                            I think you'll be the only one in Tehran who's praying the correct way, you and (unintelligible), the kids.\r\n                            1:05:32\r\n                            You'll be the one, and they'll laugh at you. When you tell them, and they \"Sharooz\" \"I just say the name of God alone.\"\r\n                            1:05:37\r\n                            \"So, you mean, you don't mention Muhammad, or Ahlul Beyt or Ali?\"\r\n                            1:05:43\r\n                            See, this is what we cleaned out. We cleaned out all the creatures. (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:05:49\r\n                            And this is historic. You are a first generation. Dr. Khalifa: Does this make you special or not? When you're the only one in Tehran who's praying the correct way.\r\n                            1:05:59\r\n                            Lisa: How beautiful the Highest Heaven is. We know, of course, that these are all allegorical descriptions that God uses allegory because there is no way\r\n                            1:06:07\r\n                            that we in our present state can even begin to understand really what is in store for us.\r\n                            1:06:14\r\n                            But we know from the allegory of the Highest Heaven that it is truly bliss.\r\n                            1:06:21\r\n                            And that it is wonderful beyond our dreams. God says that anything we wish for, anything those who are in the Highest Heaven, IN SHAA ALLAH, we'll be there,\r\n                            1:06:32\r\n                            Anything they wish for and even more. So, God's grace is even greater than anything we can comprehend or desire, wish for.\r\n                            1:06:45\r\n                            And then those on the right, those in the Lower Heaven, for them also, it's incredibly beautiful.\r\n                            1:06:54\r\n                            And it's peace. [56:91] Peace to you from those on the right.\r\n                            1:07:01\r\n                            An incredible, incredible triumph to be among those on the right. [56:92]. But if he is one of the rejecters, the strayers, [56:93] then the retribution [56:94] and burning hell.\r\n                            1:07:16\r\n                            We know, again, that we can't comprehend really the awfulness of hell.\r\n                            1:07:24\r\n                            We have a slight idea because we are as far from God as anything in the universe at this point.\r\n                            1:07:32\r\n                            And we know how hellish this world is and how awful it is, particularly when you step out of God's kingdom.\r\n                            1:07:38\r\n                            We're incredibly blessed to be in God's kingdom, IN SHAA ALLAH. But as soon as you step out, you know what an incredible hell that is.\r\n                            1:07:48\r\n                            And that is nothing compared to the ultimate hell.\r\n                            1:07:56\r\n                            [56:95] This is the inevitable truth. [56:96] You shall glorify the name of your Lord, the Great.\r\n                            “Special people” and those who die before 40 explained. “Some of us where swept in the crowd” to agree with Satan. Earth is our chance of redemption. Martin Luther King as an example.\r\n                            1:08:04\r\n                            Mã Shã Allãh Are there any comments or questions on these last verses?\r\n                            1:08:12\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: 38 and 89 refer to you, you special people.\r\n                            1:08:19\r\n                            And I say this with thanking God and God says \"speak up of God's blessings on you.\"\r\n                            1:08:24\r\n                            We're very rare, fortunate, and blessed group of people. And 90 refers to all the people who died before the age of 40.\r\n                            1:08:37\r\n                            It says, as, as... [56:90] and if he belongs with those from the right -\r\n                            1:08:44\r\n                            Those people will be very happy. Because they will go to the Lower Heaven.\r\n                            1:08:51\r\n                            God knew that they deserved... they do not deserve to go to hell. They deserve to go to the Lower Heaven\r\n                            1:08:57\r\n                            because of circumstances that only He knows. That's why He took them at (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:09:03\r\n                            The children that came here to perform a function. And they were assigned souls that God knows deserve to go to the Lower Heaven.\r\n                            1:09:12\r\n                            Well, they lived until the age of 39 or just before 40. And then God takes them at that time.\r\n                            1:09:18\r\n                            Because had they lived, they would have been swept by circumstances.\r\n                            1:09:27\r\n                            Which brings me to a point that I will be talking about, IN SHAA ALLAH, in the Khutba two weeks from today, IN SHAA ALLAH.\r\n                            1:09:37\r\n                            Where very quickly, Ibrahim, God says \"we granted Abraham his understanding, for we were fully aware of him.\"\r\n                            1:09:47\r\n                            Ok. This verse tells you it was not Abraham's intelligence that led him to discover God.\r\n                            1:09:52\r\n                            God granted him the understanding because God knew that Abraham deserved to go to the High Heaven.\r\n                            1:10:01\r\n                            And the other verse that I wish to share with you is Joseph. When Joseph almost fell for the governor's wife.\r\n                            1:10:08\r\n                            And then God said \"if it were not that he saw a sign from his Lord.\" Then, God says \"we thus diverted sin from him.\r\n                            1:10:15\r\n                            So, was it Joseph who was so great that he didn't fall in sin? Or, was it God that protected him from sin?\r\n                            1:10:21\r\n                            It was God that protected him from sin. By the way, the verse goes on and says, (12:24) إِنَّهُۥ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا ٱلْمُخْلَصِينَ\r\n                            1:10:26\r\n                            That he was one of our devoted servants. Because he was one of God's devoted servants, God diverted him, protected him from sin.\r\n                            1:10:37\r\n                            So, what I'm saying is that when we agreed with Satan billions of years ago,\r\n                            1:10:46\r\n                            some of us were swept in the crowd. And God knew that.\r\n                            1:10:52\r\n                            This is what God meant when he said to the angels. The angels said \"put them all in hell.\" And God said \"I know what you do not know.\"\r\n                            1:10:59\r\n                            So, God knows that we were swept in the crowd. Some of us were swept in the crowd and do not deserve to go to hell.\r\n                            1:11:07\r\n                            This is why God granted Abraham his understanding. God granted you the fortune to come across the true message,\r\n                            1:11:15\r\n                            worshipping Him alone and upholding His word alone. It's not because you're clever or because I'm smart.\r\n                            1:11:23\r\n                            It's because, apparently, God, not apparently, obviously God knew that some of us were swept\r\n                            1:11:30\r\n                            in the crowd somehow. And we agreed with Satan. And we deserve the chance to come here to be redeemed.\r\n                            1:11:40\r\n                            So, the people who are taken, like Martin Luther King, taken only a few months before his 40th birthday,\r\n                            1:11:47\r\n                            Malcolm X, being taken two months before his birthday, his 40th birthday,\r\n                            1:11:53\r\n                            and all the other signs that we have seen. In fact, if you look at verse 41, where you're holding the book now, you see in 41, it's the beginning of hell.\r\n                            “Once in the age of 41 you better be worshipping God alone.”\r\n                            1:12:04\r\n                            So, those of you who make the decision, we look in the previous Sura, verse 41.\r\n                            1:12:10\r\n                            Well, now we know, we know from this circle here that these numbers of verses are designed, divinely designed, for a reason.\r\n                            1:12:17\r\n                            And we have all these mathematical proofs. Once you get into the age of 41, you'd better be worshipping God alone.\r\n                            1:12:29\r\n                            Just a second. I don't wanna forget what I'm saying. So, had God left Martin Luther King to live beyond the age of 40,\r\n                            1:12:38\r\n                            he would have been swept. That's the word that brought me to the next Khutba two weeks from now. He would have been swept by his environment and his circumstances into maybe mentioning Jesus and things like that.\r\n                            1:12:48\r\n                            (unintelligible) He was a pastor in a church, I think. But in his heart, and even vocally, he never said anything about Jesus.\r\n                            1:12:56\r\n                            Not that I heard of. In his vast amount of recordings, he always talked about God.\r\n                            1:13:02\r\n                            So, this is why God chose to take him at that time to protect him from going beyond to this number 41, and being swept by his environment and his circumstances into Christianity.\r\n                            1:13:18\r\n                            So, he will be like we see here on verse 90. [56:90] If he belongs with those on the right - [56:91] Then, peace to you from those on the right.\r\n                            1:13:26\r\n                            We can be sure that God's justice put these people exactly in the right place.\r\n                            1:13:32\r\n                            He deserves to be in the Lower Heaven. When, when Satan made that blasphemy billions of years ago, there were degrees of convictions among us.\r\n                            1:13:43\r\n                            To go from the jinns who completely agreed with Satan, to the majority of humans who were wishy-washy. They didn't...\r\n                            1:13:51\r\n                            to some who were swept in the crowd. And hopefully, that's us.\r\n                            1:13:58\r\n                            So, now Cathy has a question.\r\n                            1:14:06\r\n                            You're talking about a very special group of people who will be the closest to God on the Day of Judgement. They are very special people.\r\n                            1:14:13\r\n                            And this will be like when the Prophet Muhammad started to preach.\r\n                            1:14:19\r\n                            Well, let's go to Abraham. Abraham started Islam. And then there were people who were with him when the others were throwing him in the fire.\r\n                            1:14:30\r\n                            And then by the time the Prophet Muhammad came, they became idol worshippers. Then, the message was renewed by revealing the Quran through the Prophet Muhammad.\r\n                            1:14:38\r\n                            And he was secretly preaching. And there were people with him. Those are very special people. This is the first generation.\r\n                            1:14:45\r\n                            And then Muhammad became victorious and he opened Mecca. And all the people in Mecca became believers.\r\n                            1:14:50\r\n                            They jumped in the wagon. But they do not deserve the same credit as the people who were with him when he was being persecuted and having stones thrown at him. And\r\n                            1:14:59\r\n                            he was cursed and called names and persecuted.\r\n                            1:15:05\r\n                            Does this make sense? So, that was a first generation at the time of Ibrahim, at the time of Muhammad.\r\n                            1:15:12\r\n                            And then ten years ago, Islam was totally corrupted. There is not a single mosque in the world that upholds the commandment to mention only the name of God in the mosque,\r\n                            1:15:22\r\n                            in the worship practices and so on. And then God renewed the message with this miracle.\r\n                            1:15:29\r\n                            So, now we are a first generation. And the people who are in this movement, while it is being persecuted and the names and the insults and so on, are very special people.\r\n                            1:15:41\r\n                            Now, ten years from now, we'll probably have millions. Maybe twenty years, fifty years from now. And everybody will jump in the wagon, but they do not deserve the same credit as you do.\r\n                            1:15:50\r\n                            So, these very special people will be multiplied from this generation. And after that, when it is famous and successful and it is the thing to do, they don't deserve the same credit. They will not be in the same rank.\r\n                            1:16:05\r\n                            This is what we did last week when we were absent.\r\n                            1:16:11\r\n                            We didn't even know if it was really for you or not. We didn't have birth certificates then. By just guessing that the Prophet was holy, who was awakened and given the Quran.\r\n                            1:16:20\r\n                            But it has nothing to do with that. It is in the Quran, Sura 46, verse 50, it says... It's what it says there.\r\n                            1:16:30\r\n                            It's based on that. Dr. Khalifa: Any other questions? Lisa: [57:4] .... He is with you wherever you may be. God is Seer of everything you do.\r\n                            1:16:39\r\n                            He truly is in absolute control of the universe.\r\n                            1:16:47\r\n                            This verse, to me, expresses it very, very clearly and very, very beautifully.\r\n                            1:16:54\r\n                            Verse 5, [57:5] To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. God is in full control of all things.\r\n                            1:17:02\r\n                            These verses again and again are saying absolutely what we've been saying that God does everything.\r\n                            1:17:09\r\n                            And yet it is so hard for us to accept that. You can hear it and you can say \"yes\", but then you get sidetracked.\r\n                            1:17:22\r\n                            \"Oh, if I don't take my vitamins I'm gonna get sick.\" You aren't gonna get sick unless you deserve to get sick.\r\n                            1:17:30\r\n                            That doesn't mean you shouldn't take your vitamins. Because God, you know, God has given us the vitamins. He has given us the medicines. He has given...\r\n                            1:17:37\r\n                            But we have to remember that God is the One who is controlling everything, who is doing everything.\r\n                            1:17:43\r\n                            God controls our bosses. God controls our neighbors. God controls our spouses.\r\n                            1:17:48\r\n                            He controls not only the physical things. He controls the emotions, the hearts and the minds of those around us and of us.\r\n                            1:17:56\r\n                            As Rashad pointed out so beautifully, God bestowed on Abraham his righteousness, his understanding.\r\n                            1:18:03\r\n                            Well, God says very clearly that He bestows on all of us our righteousness. It's not us.\r\n                            1:18:08\r\n                            It's not ours. We... God gives it to us. He controls our hearts and our minds.\r\n                            1:18:15\r\n                            If we make that one choice. The only thing we really control is that one choice of whether we worship God alone or not.\r\n                            1:18:22\r\n                            Once we've made that decision, He goes from there. He takes it from there.\r\n                            1:18:27\r\n                            And there are a lot of verses that talk about God misguiding those who disbelieve.\r\n                            1:18:34\r\n                            Well, they make..... A woman: Yeah. Any questions about the Lower Heaven?\r\n                            1:18:42\r\n                            How? 41.\r\n                            1:18:47\r\n                            Hell goes right after 41. Wait, what?\r\n                            1:18:53\r\n                            It's 41. My God. Yeah. Dr. Khalifa: This has a meaning.\r\n                            1:19:00\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yep. 41 means hell. If you don't make that decision.\r\n                            1:19:07\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: If you don't make that decision by that time. A woman: Okay.\r\n                            1:19:12\r\n                            A woman: That's clear. I mean, wait a minute. Dr. Khalifa: 41 and higher.\r\n                            1:19:18\r\n                            We didn't make the decision. A woman: Subhan Allah. Dr. Khalifa: Remember the circle?\r\n                            1:19:24\r\n                            This circle here means every verse in the Quran is numbered according to a system, God's system.\r\n                            1:19:37\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ We seek refuge in God from Satan, who was the basic cause for us being here in this world.\r\n                            1:19:49\r\n                            And, in fact, may God make it backfire on Satan and give us happiness in this world and forever\r\n                            1:19:57\r\n                            through believing in God alone. Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.\r\n                            1:20:08\r\n                            We are gonna start with Sura 51, page 366.\r\n                            1:20:15\r\n                            And our teacher tonight, I forgot his name. I don't know if you remember. What's your name, sir?\r\n                            1:20:21\r\n                            Douglas: Rashid Dr. Khalifa: What's your name? Douglas: Rashid.\r\n                            1:20:26\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: I'm serious. We actually forgot. Dr. Khalifa: Rashid? Douglas: Douglas.\r\n                            1:20:33\r\n                            Douglas: It's Douglas. Douglas Brown. Dr. Khalifa: Douglas Brown? Douglas: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: You're sure? Douglas: I'm sure of that.\r\n                            1:20:38\r\n                            Douglas: You'll find out later when I... Dr. Khalifa: He's a very nervous teacher today.\r\n                            1:20:50\r\n                            The Sura. You know, a believer appreciates God differently from people who are unaware or who are not strong believers.\r\n                            “Imagine sending astronauts into space” explains verses of the Quran. We are Astronauts on spaceship Earth. Oxygen levels.\r\n                            1:21:02\r\n                            You can see here that the title of the Sura is \"the Winds.\" And we learn from the first few verses that the winds, their main job is to carry clouds and bring bounties.\r\n                            1:21:14\r\n                            We need that water. So, in order to appreciate God and these simple words, just imagine yourself sending 10 astronauts to space.\r\n                            1:21:25\r\n                            You sending 10 astronauts to space. And you tell them \"Okay, you're gonna be out there for three years. And when you need water, I made an invention in the spaceship so there'll be these clouds on top of you and they will give you water.\"\r\n                            1:21:40\r\n                            You're sending them into space. And you devise that system that will give them water, clean water.\r\n                            1:21:49\r\n                            When they pollute the water they have on the spaceship, it's gonna... you know, one of the... number one purification processes is distillation.\r\n                            1:21:59\r\n                            So, when they pollute, their own water is gonna evaporate. It's gonna be pure water and come down again. So, you tell them that, so, to assure them that they will have enough water supply for three years or five years, ten years, whatever\r\n                            1:22:11\r\n                            you're sending them. Just imagine that. See, God sent this spaceship with five billion astronauts. You and me, we are astronauts.\r\n                            1:22:19\r\n                            That's right. And God gave us this system. God devised this system where the water evaporates and then comes down by... the wind drive the clouds here.\r\n                            1:22:31\r\n                            How far are we from the ocean? We're far from the ocean. But these clouds came to us from the ocean, by the wind.\r\n                            1:22:40\r\n                            It's a traveling system. And that sends down pure water. You appreciate God if you think.\r\n                            1:22:48\r\n                            But if you imagine sending ten astronauts in space and you tell them \"I'm going to give the exact\r\n                            1:22:54\r\n                            percentage of oxygen for you to breathe.\" Now, in 1967, we were technologically advanced people. In 1967.\r\n                            1:23:04\r\n                            But we put three astronauts in a capsule in an atmosphere of 100% oxygen.\r\n                            1:23:11\r\n                            Pure oxygen, right? To breathe. And all it took was a spark.\r\n                            1:23:16\r\n                            And the three astronauts were combusted. Ed White, Gus Grissom, and Roger Chaffee.\r\n                            1:23:23\r\n                            They're not with us today because of that. We were really advanced in science.\r\n                            1:23:31\r\n                            But when you put anything in pure oxygen and light a match, everything would be combusted. Everything.\r\n                            1:23:37\r\n                            Everything organic, that is. In fact, this is for chemists.\r\n                            1:23:43\r\n                            If any chemist is here, this is the last thing you do to find out if there is, for example, radioactivity in the ashes of anything.\r\n                            1:23:50\r\n                            You put it in a closed thing there. You fill it with 100% oxygen.\r\n                            1:23:55\r\n                            And you create a spark. And everything will be combusted into ashes.\r\n                            1:24:01\r\n                            This is what happened to the three astronauts. And this is why God didn't give us 100% oxygen. We have 20% oxygen. The rest is nitrogen.\r\n                            1:24:11\r\n                            And this is what they do now when they send astronauts into space.\r\n                            1:24:17\r\n                            But we learned the hard way. So, despite our...\r\n                            1:24:23\r\n                            I mean, we were sending people to the moon. And we couldn't give them the correct atmosphere.\r\n                            1:24:31\r\n                            So, these few verses here will make us appreciate God if we think of sending our own astronauts into space.\r\n                            1:24:44\r\n                            Of course, you know how the oxygen is generated for us. We breathe it and we get out carbon dioxide, which is not good for breathing.\r\n                            1:24:52\r\n                            So, God designed the trees so they will take carbon dioxide and turn it into apples and give us the oxygen.\r\n                            1:24:58\r\n                            They take the carbon and give us back the oxygen. How do you like that for a system? Can you do that for your astronauts?\r\n                            1:25:08\r\n                            You tell your 10 astronauts, you're gonna be out there for 10 years and you're gonna breathe out carbon dioxide. So, I'm gonna give you\r\n                            1:25:14\r\n                            a couple of... I invented these plants or something that will take your carbon dioxide, turn it into food for you, and you'll get the oxygen back.\r\n                            1:25:26\r\n                            That's what God's created. And you think it's all evolution, right?\r\n                            1:25:37\r\n                            Are there any questions on these, the winds and the rains? (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:25:44\r\n                            We're talking only about the 5 billion human beings. Don't forget the 10 decillion ants and about 200 billion mice. Ihsan.\r\n                            1:26:01\r\n                            There may be a few of them in this mosque running around.\r\n                            1:26:06\r\n                            The name scares her this way. OK, back to Douglas. Yes, Cathy.\r\n                            1:26:13\r\n                            Cathy: (unintelligible) and we do it. 3-year-old children, 2-year-old children. I mean, language is just amazing. (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:26:29\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: This is mentioned specifically as a great miracle in the Koran, the language. Just go to Europe.\r\n                            1:26:36\r\n                            Cathy: Well, We don't doubt it. Dr. Khalifa: Where...\r\n                            1:26:41\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Within a radius of 50 miles, not 50, 20 miles in Europe, you can come across 15 languages.\r\n                            1:26:48\r\n                            Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria.\r\n                            1:26:53\r\n                            Within Czechoslovakia, there are several languages. And it's just amazing how these people understand each other, but these people don't understand them. They understand each other.\r\n                            Abraham had two sons and Christians distorted that.\r\n                            1:27:07\r\n                            It's a miracle. It's still amazing.\r\n                            1:27:17\r\n                            Douglas: Any questions or comments?\r\n                            1:27:26\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: There you said it, his only son. Isaac was never the only son.\r\n                            1:27:32\r\n                            You said the truth right there.\r\n                            1:27:40\r\n                            This is how they justify it. It didn't say \"take your only legitimate son.\" It said \"take your only son.\"\r\n                            1:27:46\r\n                            Even if he's illegitimate. But he was not illegitimate.\r\n                            1:27:51\r\n                            Did it say \"you take your only son or your only legitimate son?\"\r\n                            1:27:58\r\n                            No. Somebody.... of course, the Jews and the Christians believe it was Isaac.\r\n                            1:28:05\r\n                            But that's a racial, that's a racial distortion. They said \"take your only son, Isaac,....\"\r\n                            1:28:13\r\n                            So, they made a boo-boo there, because Isaac was never the only son. So when you tell them, when you confront them with that \"only son\" business, because Ishmael was 14 years older than Isaac.\r\n                            1:28:25\r\n                            They tell you \"oh, because Isaac was the only legitimate son. I said \"OK, let's look at the Bible.\" And the Bible consistently calls Ishmael Abraham's son until Ibrahim dies. And then they say\r\n                            1:28:35\r\n                            \"when Abraham died, his two sons, Ishmael and Isaac, buried him.\"\r\n                            1:28:41\r\n                            So there's no way out.\r\n                            1:28:47\r\n                            No. No, he didn't. No, you read it in some novel.\r\n                            1:28:55\r\n                            From who? No, no, it's not in Genesis, no.\r\n                            1:29:05\r\n                            OK, Abraham had, I mean, Sarah was sterile. She didn't have anything but Isaac.\r\n                            1:29:15\r\n                            There are lots of novels that he said, we married this and that.\r\n                            1:29:28\r\n                            Many other children are irrelevant, because the Quran and the Bible mention only Ishmael and Isaac.\r\n                            1:29:35\r\n                            Nobody else. In Genesis 22, in Genesis 22, around 25, it says \"when Abraham died, his two sons, Ishmael and Isaac, buried him.\"\r\n                            1:29:49\r\n                            So, Ishmael was Abraham's son. He was the only son of Abraham for 14 years.\r\n                            1:29:56\r\n                            Isaac was never the only son.\r\n                            1:30:03\r\n                            Isaac is the father of the Jews. Ishmael is the father of the Arabs. Dr. Khalifa: The Jews wrote about.... I mean, played around with the Genesis, the Torah.\r\n                            1:30:12\r\n                            A woman: So, the idea is that they just wanted a miracle to be a miracle to Isaac?\r\n                            1:30:20\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Right, they didn't want anything Ishmael to have anything to do with anything.\r\n                            1:30:26\r\n                            So, they made a big mistake. It's just like....\r\n                            1:30:31\r\n                            So, they made a big mistake. It's just like the two verses in the Quran. Exactly, they made a glaring error.\r\n                            1:30:40\r\n                            And they tried to correct it in the newer editions of the Bible. They say \"take your only one.\"\r\n                            1:30:48\r\n                            Trying very hard, but they make it worse. The only one what? Donkey or....?\r\n                            Homosexuality brought on by parents taking their children out of God’s protection.\r\n                            1:31:02\r\n                            A woman: You're talking about (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:31:09\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: They don't learn, do they? They haven't learned a thing.\r\n                            1:31:15\r\n                            People bring their destruction on themselves. We know that Sodom and Gomorrah, they were all corrupted beyond reform.\r\n                            1:31:24\r\n                            And this is the one thing that.... and they brought it on themselves. So, it is God's law that when they do this, they are destroyed.\r\n                            1:31:34\r\n                            Nowadays, when homosexuals are spread in the society, you cannot just destroy the city of Tucson because there are\r\n                            1:31:41\r\n                            a thousand homosexuals in it. But you can send a virus to pick them out.\r\n                            1:31:49\r\n                            This is what's happening now.\r\n                            1:31:55\r\n                            Their parents brought it on them. Right, they brought it on themselves, their family.\r\n                            1:32:03\r\n                            Their family take the children out of God's protection. This is what happens.\r\n                            \r\n                            \r\n                            16 Quran Study From Behrouz 616 Sura 64 By Rashad Nothing Happens Except Sura 70 By Edip Worry Chast\r\n                            \r\n                            \r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: For the benefit of the people outside of Tucson,  I'm gonna repeat that we seek refuge in God   from Satan. Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem. In the  name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. We're  \r\n                            0:10\r\n                            starting today on Sura 64. And, where is, where  is Lisa? She's over there.\r\n                            0:17\r\n                            (unintelligible) Oh. See there. Just go around. Go around with us. See, they raised their hands. First, I wanna welcome Salim and his wife.  \r\n                            0:35\r\n                            She's here for the first time, and he was here  last week. So, I'm glad you came. Thanks, Stephanie.  \r\n                            0:43\r\n                            And also, I didn't get a chance to welcome  Philip's wife. She was here two or three times,  \r\n                            0:51\r\n                            and I was wondering who she was. Finally, he  told me. So, welcome to the group. You notice  \r\n                            0:59\r\n                            in the new translation, the word \"GOD\" is written in  bold, big letters. And at the bottom of the page,  \r\n                            1:07\r\n                            on the left side, you see the number 9? This  is the number of occurrences of the word \"God\" on  \r\n                            1:13\r\n                            this page. If you count them easily, 1, 2, 3,  4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This is the total, the word  \r\n                            1:23\r\n                            \"God\" on this page. And on the right side is the  total up to this page, from the beginning of the  \r\n                            1:28\r\n                            Quran. The objective of this is to let the reader  participate in the mathematical code of the Quran,  \r\n                            1:36\r\n                            which proves to the person that he is looking at  God's message to him or her. And this is not a  \r\n                            1:42\r\n                            human-made book. Muhammad didn't just invent it  and make it up. You are reading God's message,  \r\n                            1:50\r\n                            and this mathematical code gives you the  confidence that God is speaking to you,  \r\n                            1:56\r\n                            not any human being who's trying to fool you.  The total number of the word God in the Quran,  \r\n                            2:03\r\n                            as you know, is 2,698, which is a multiple of 19.  19 being the common denominator throughout the  \r\n                            2:11\r\n                            Quran. And I'm using just this word as an example.  But every letter in the Quran is mathematically  \r\n                            2:20\r\n                            coded, mathematically composed, and the whole  system is easily superhuman, as all of you know.  \r\n                            2:30\r\n                            So, this is one observation I want to make about  the translation. Of course, the Arabic will go   in the empty rectangle here. We don't have the  Arabic yet. So IN SHAA ALLAH, we'll be sending it to  \r\n                            2:43\r\n                            the press around mid, the end of April, towards  the end of April. No, towards the end of May,\r\n                            2:55\r\n                            or the beginning of May. I'm trying to calculate when  the night of power is. We're gonna send it off,  \r\n                            Dr. Rashad Khalifa talks of the night of Power.\r\n                            3:01\r\n                            IN SHAA ALLAH, on the night of power, which is April.  May 3. Right, okay, there we go. I was adding  \r\n                            3:11\r\n                            April 7 plus 27. It comes to April 34th. So, that's  very late in April, or very early in May. It will  \r\n                            3:27\r\n                            take six or seven weeks to print, and then we'll  have the Arabic and the complete book with us.\r\n                            3:34\r\n                            In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. [64:1] Glorifying God is everything in the heavens and everything on earth. To Him belongs all kingship, and to Him belongs all praise, and He is Omnipotent.   \r\n                            3:47\r\n                            This is a heavy verse right  there. Glorifying God is everything in the heavens  \r\n                            3:55\r\n                            and every thing on earth. And this includes things,  includes the bodies of the disbelievers. Because  \r\n                            4:04\r\n                            the disbeliever does not control his heartbeats.  There's a specific number of heartbeats. And the  \r\n                            4:11\r\n                            disbeliever does not control that. God controls  that. So, the human body is glorifying God. Every  \r\n                            4:17\r\n                            atom in your body, every atom in this carpet, in  this wall, is glorifying God. They follow... We have chemists and  \r\n                            4:25\r\n                            physicists here, and they know that every atom in  the wall or the floor or the ceiling, inside this  \r\n                            4:33\r\n                            light, every atom has a nucleus and a certain  number of electrons, and they're continuously  \r\n                            4:39\r\n                            moving in a specific way. It's just, it's a microcosm  of the cosmos.\r\n                            4:50\r\n                            [64:1] Glorifying God is everything in the heavens and everything on earth. To him  belongs all kingship.\r\n                            4:58\r\n                            God is the one who hires you or fires you. God is the one who determines how many dollars you get. Not anybody else. God  \r\n                            “God is the one who hires you and fires you” – “if you do your part God will do his part” God guarantees your happiness. Word “Omnipotent” backs up this Truth.\r\n                            5:06\r\n                            decides the provisions. Somebody was telling  me today that they wanted... they were getting another child,  \r\n                            5:15\r\n                            and somebody asked \"can you afford it?\" That's the wrong question. The question is not, can you afford it? The question  \r\n                            5:23\r\n                            is \"can God afford it?\" Because God is the one  who brings the people into this world, and God   is the one who provides for them. When a child  is born, God provides for that child. Not you.\r\n                            5:39\r\n                            [64:1] .... To Him belongs all kingship, and to Him belongs all  praise. He is Omnipotent.\r\n                            5:46\r\n                            And God....these are all important attributes of God that we must know. Omnipotent means He backs up His guarantee. And He guarantees  \r\n                            5:58\r\n                            you perfect happiness if you are in His domain. If you follow... if you do your part, carrying out the commandments,  \r\n                            6:04\r\n                            God will do His part. Perfect happiness, success  in everything you do. Guaranteed. God's guarantee  \r\n                            6:11\r\n                            or warranty is much better than General Motors'  guarantee or warranty. When you have a warranty  \r\n                            6:19\r\n                            from Lee Iacocca, you have confidence in it.  Because he backs up his warranty. Seven years or  \r\n                            6:28\r\n                            7,000 miles. And you take this piece of paper, and  you're happy with it. Well, God is Omnipotent, and  \r\n                            6:34\r\n                            He guarantees your happiness. It's true. God is  giving you a warranty in this Quran. And He says\r\n                            6:45\r\n                            \"if you do your part, I will do My part.\" This is in  Sura 2, at the beginning, as you know. It says,  \r\n                            6:50\r\n                            (2:40) أَوْفُوا۟ بِعَهْدِىٓ أُوفِ بِعَهْدِكُمْ \"do your part, I'll do My part.\" And our part  is nothing. What is it? Five Prayers a day,  \r\n                            6:59\r\n                            fasting the month of Ramadan, the things that are good for us. This is our part. It's like God is saying \"come, you're gonna be  happy, and I'm gonna give you all the money  \r\n                            7:08\r\n                            you want and all the health you want, on condition  that you do your part.\" A lot of people say \"no,\r\n                            7:14\r\n                            I don't wanna be happy and healthy. I wanna be miserable.\" You don't wanna... Yes.\r\n                            7:23\r\n                            Now, God's part is overwhelming. It's great. Verse  number two. So, the word \"Omnipotent\" backs up this  \r\n                            7:34\r\n                            guarantee. The guarantee is outright in the Quran,  23 times in the Quran. God guarantees you perfect  \r\n                            7:41\r\n                            health. For example, in Sura 10, verse 62. I'd  like to go back to this, because a lot of people  \r\n                            7:48\r\n                            can't envision. They can't envision that. But God  controls every atom in their bodies and can decide  \r\n                            7:55\r\n                            how much health they have. When God tells you \"I'll give you perfect health, when you do your  \r\n                            8:02\r\n                            part\", God, the Omnipotent, means that. You have  to share the new Quran, Greg, with somebody. Yeah.  \r\n                            8:15\r\n                            This is the importance of Omnipotence. Okay, in Sura  10, verse 62, God says \"absolutely, God's allies,  \r\n                            8:24\r\n                            or God's people, have nothing to fear, nothing to  worry about.\"\r\n                            8:30\r\n                            (10:62) لَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ And then it gives you a description of these people. It says \"those who believe and lead a righteous life.\" Those who believe in  \r\n                            8:39\r\n                            God and they lead a righteous life. They  are nice people. They are honest, truthful,   and God is their god. God is always in their  mind, in everything they do, everything they say.  \r\n                            8:53\r\n                            Those who believe and lead a righteous life. \"For  them is happiness in this world.\" I'm quoting now.\r\n                            Hadith claims the most miserable are the most righteous. There are categories within Satan’s Kingdom and God’s Kingdom. Talk of Appreciation i.e “the Eyes”.\r\n                            9:00\r\n                            I'm quoting those verses. Verse 62 of Sura 10.  \"For them is happiness in this world.\" And this  \r\n                            9:05\r\n                            is God speaking. \"and in the Hereafter.\" So, this  warranty or guarantee from God is repeated 23  \r\n                            9:13\r\n                            times in the Quran. Now as you know, Satan tricks  the other people who deviate from the Quran and  \r\n                            9:25\r\n                            they have other sources like Hadith and Sunnah and  God knows what, all kinds of sources besides the  \r\n                            9:31\r\n                            Quran. Their number one Hadith goes like this. \"The  most righteous among you is the most miserable.\"\r\n                            9:39\r\n                            This is a very famous Hadith. Because Satan  knows that he cannot give them happiness.\r\n                            9:45\r\n                            And actually the Hadith goes on and says \"the most  miserable are the prophets, and then the saints,   and then the believers.\" That's right. So, and this  is an authentic Bukhari Hadith. It goes directly  \r\n                            9:58\r\n                            against the Quran. The Quran says otherwise. Says \"those who believe and lead a righteous life   are guaranteed happiness.\" I'm gonna go back a  little bit again and talk about the title of the  \r\n                            10:11\r\n                            Sura, Mutual Blaming. Mutual Blaming is one of  the names of the Day of Judgment. It's called the  \r\n                            10:18\r\n                            Day of Resurrection. It's called the Day of  Judgment. It's called the Day of Reckoning.\r\n                            10:24\r\n                            It's called the Day of Mutual Blaming. Because this is  the day when a lot of people will be blaming each  \r\n                            10:29\r\n                            other. \"You're the one who told me this.\" \"No, you're  the one who told me this.\" \"You took me out of this  \r\n                            10:36\r\n                            place.\" \"You took me into that place.\" So, there'll be mutual blaming. In fact, the people of  \r\n                            10:44\r\n                            hell will spend eternity beating each other. And  thanking each other for beating each other. \"So, if  \r\n                            10:52\r\n                            you give me 10 kicks, I'll give you 10 kicks.\"  Okay. Mutual Blaming. One of the names of the  \r\n                            10:59\r\n                            Day of Judgment. Verse 2 says [64:2] He is the one who created you. Then among you there is the disbeliever and the believer. God is fully seer of everything you do.\r\n                            11:14\r\n                            There are only two kinds of people. People in God's kingdom and people in  Satan's kingdom. There's nothing else. No other  \r\n                            11:23\r\n                            choices. Although there are categories within  each section. For example, Satan's kingdom has the  \r\n                            11:30\r\n                            disbelievers and the hypocrites. And both of them  fall under the bigger category of disbelievers.  \r\n                            11:38\r\n                            Other names for believer and disbeliever is  appreciative and unappreciative. These are other  \r\n                            11:44\r\n                            names. Appreciative of God or unappreciative.  And we're gonna get to this in Sura 76. Not today. \r\n                            11:55\r\n                            But these are the other synonyms  of believer and disbeliever. Appreciative and   unappreciative. Because God gave you a lot of good  things in advance. Then, He asked you to show your  \r\n                            12:08\r\n                            appreciation. Let us take for example your eyes.  Just your eyes. And I've shared this with some  \r\n                            12:15\r\n                            of you before. If you're walking out in the street  and somebody puts a gun to your head. And he says\r\n                            12:21\r\n                            \"your eyes or five Prayers a day.\" What will you do? Not your eyes or your money. You're gonna say\r\n                            12:28\r\n                            \"you either give me your eyes or promise me to do  five Prayers a day.\" What will you choose? If this  \r\n                            12:34\r\n                            A woman: Five Prayers a day. Dr. Khalifa: If this is real... Dr. Khalifa: That's right. Easily. Right? So, God  gave you your eyes in advance. If you want  \r\n                            12:43\r\n                            to appreciate them, just close your eyes for a  couple of minutes.\r\n                            12:50\r\n                            It's something that we take for granted. I hope none of you is color blind. But if you look around and you see the red,  \r\n                            12:58\r\n                            the blue and the green and all these nice colors.  God's people are perfect anyway. You notice.  \r\n                            13:11\r\n                            Alhamdu Lillah. Thank God we all have two eyes  each. So, God gave you these eyes in advance and He  \r\n                            13:17\r\n                            said \"you do five Prayers a day.\" Appreciative and  unappreciative. The people who are not worshipping  \r\n                            13:24\r\n                            God alone are not appreciative. I didn't mentioned the lungs or the kidneys. Nobody will want to  \r\n                            13:39\r\n                            substitute God's kidneys for the technologically  advanced artificial kidneys that they have.  \r\n                            13:46\r\n                            They're small now. They're only about six feet  tall and four feet wide and three feet deep.  \r\n                            13:53\r\n                            And these are the most advanced kidneys. They take  the patient blood completely into the machine.\r\n                            People ask “why did God send me here”. Dr. Rashad Khalifa explains.\r\n                            14:02\r\n                            And it's not as good. You should see those people. So, we thank God. He gave you all these things in advance. Number three.\r\n                            14:17\r\n                            [64:3] He created the heavens and the earth for a specific purpose.  Designed you and perfected your design. Then to Him is the final destiny.\r\n                            14:30\r\n                            Footnote 64:3 says \"we  are in this world due to God's immense mercy and  \r\n                            14:37\r\n                            Most Gracious will to redeem us after we committed  the gross blasphemy. See the introduction and\r\n                            14:45\r\n                            appendix 7.\" You know, a lot of people say \"why did God bring  me here? I didn't wanna come here.\" Because they  \r\n                            14:52\r\n                            don't understand why we are here. If they read  the Quran, they will know why we are here.\r\n                            14:58\r\n                            And they will realize that we committed a gross crime  billions of years ago. And God decided to give  \r\n                            15:04\r\n                            us a chance to redeem ourselves, to denounce idol  worship. But the majority of people insist on idol  \r\n                            15:13\r\n                            worship. The vast majority of Christians insist  on worshiping Jesus. And the vast majority of  \r\n                            15:19\r\n                            Muslims insist on worshiping Muhammad. It's  just the human nature. They're all humans.  \r\n                            15:26\r\n                            And the Quran makes that statement in advance.  It says \"most people, no matter what you do,  \r\n                            15:32\r\n                            will not believe.\" Because God knows these are the  creatures who committed that blasphemy billions  \r\n                            15:38\r\n                            of years ago. And I don't wanna bore you with  repetition of what it is.\r\n                            15:46\r\n                            And then God says that of the minority that will believe, the majority  will fall in idol worship. Because God knows...\r\n                            15:57\r\n                            I mean, this is what brought us here. We did  not uphold God's absolute authority. And this is  \r\n                            16:04\r\n                            why we have that tendency to idolize saints and  prophets. The vast majority of people fall in that  \r\n                            16:12\r\n                            trap. So, He created the heavens and the earth for  a specific purpose, which is redeeming those among  \r\n                            16:20\r\n                            us who deserve to be redeemed. So, we can go back  and join, rejoin God's kingdom. If we fail, then we'll  \r\n                            16:32\r\n                            be exiled from God's kingdom, and that is hell. It  only makes sense, like I told you at noon today.\r\n                            16:41\r\n                            If you're a chairman of the board of a company,  you don't want the lazy employees. It will cause   the company to lose. And instead of God firing  us completely, He said \"I'll give you a chance  \r\n                            16:53\r\n                            to educate yourselves, redeem yourselves, and then  come back to me. This is the specific purpose. God  \r\n                            17:02\r\n                            designed you and perfected your design. And the  design of the human being is fantastic, and\r\n                            17:11\r\n                            we never tired from describing it. Like I was using  somebody the other day to give the example. Well, we can  \r\n                            17:23\r\n                            use Greg now. See, Greg is scratching his face. Ok. His hand is like this, but it goes like that,  \r\n                            17:29\r\n                            and then it turns and scratches his face. He takes  it for granted. But this is quite a design. There  \r\n                            17:36\r\n                            are two bones in your arm here that can go  around each other, so it can go like this.  \r\n                            17:42\r\n                            I mean, how many times do you take it for granted? You go  like this. You don't even think. God perfected our  \r\n                            17:49\r\n                            design. Can you scratch every part of your body?  This is God's design. Your arm is not too short.  \r\n                            Crippled bodies are victims of Satan.\r\n                            18:02\r\n                            You can reach every inch of your body. Not  me, but... If I maintain the natural weight,  \r\n                            18:11\r\n                            I will. So, it's my fault. If there is any flaw  in your design, it's your fault.\r\n                            18:30\r\n                            Designed you and perfected your design. Anything  that goes wrong... This is very important,  \r\n                            18:41\r\n                            because people will tell you \"how about the  person who's crippled?\" It's very important to  \r\n                            18:47\r\n                            understand that that person is a victim of Satan. Something, something, they removed themselves from God's protection,  \r\n                            18:56\r\n                            and that caused Satan's victimizing them. And  the perfect example that we know, and we talked  \r\n                            19:02\r\n                            about it before many times, is Rabbi Kushner  of Boston. Rabbi Kushner of Boston. His book is  \r\n                            19:11\r\n                            full of blasphemies against God, unfortunately.  Not all the Jewish people are like that, but he  \r\n                            19:17\r\n                            is a rabbi, and he should know better. He wrote  this book \"When Bad Things Happen to Good People\"\r\n                            19:24\r\n                            and he totally misunderstands... He does not  understand Satan's role at all. And he says that  \r\n                            19:30\r\n                            the bad things happen because God cannot control  everything. God is not Omnipotent, according   to him. His book is just full of blasphemies.  Now, what happened to him... his son was born  \r\n                            19:41\r\n                            with this progeria disease, rapid aging disease.  And in 14 years, he died. So, what happened was,  \r\n                            19:50\r\n                            Rabbi Kushner, by blaspheming against God in this  manner, he removes himself from God's protection.  \r\n                            19:56\r\n                            And Satan fooled around with the embryo, with  his son, when he was inside the mother.\r\n                            Angels are the best surgeons – God promises to protect you.\r\n                            20:05\r\n                            And the child was born defective. So, whose fault is  it? The child was victimized by Satan.\r\n                            20:15\r\n                            And Rabbi Kushner was victimized by Satan, in the same  way. Because God guarantees your health through  \r\n                            20:25\r\n                            the angels, God's angels. God has some of the best  surgeons in the world. If you are to.... anything wrong happens  \r\n                            20:32\r\n                            in your body, they can go in your body and fix it. ‘Alaykum Al-Salaam. And Satan has the same ability,\r\n                            20:38\r\n                            because he was an angel. So, remember that anything, any flaw  is a result of Satan's interference. But when you  \r\n                            20:50\r\n                            look around here, this is the basic design  of God. \"designed you and perfected your  \r\n                            20:56\r\n                            design. Then, to Him is the final destiny.\" He gave  you two eyes. Because some people have accidents,  \r\n                            21:03\r\n                            they lose one eye. So, they have another spare.  Even though everyone is perfectly guarded,  \r\n                            21:12\r\n                            nothing happens against the will of God. And  God promises to protect you as long as you  \r\n                            21:18\r\n                            are in His domain. He gave us two kidneys in case  one of them stops for some reason. And remember,  \r\n                            21:28\r\n                            two ears and one mouth. I should learn from  this and stop talking. And put on the spot here,  \r\n                            21:37\r\n                            because General Spooner went AWOL. He was supposed  to be here talking. He called from Memphis today.  \r\n                            21:45\r\n                            He is alright by the way. Okay, verse 3 ends by  the statement \"to Him is the final destiny.\" Okay,  \r\n                            21:58\r\n                            so every one of us is gonna go back. And if we  did our part, we'll be prepared to join God's  \r\n                            22:04\r\n                            kingdom. If we did not do our part, and we did not  develop ourselves, we will not be able to be there  \r\n                            22:12\r\n                            physically. God forbid. The people who did not  prepare themselves will go to hell on their own  \r\n                            22:20\r\n                            volition. God will not put anybody in hell. They  will go to hell on their own volition. And we have  \r\n                            22:28\r\n                            examples. The bugs. You put the light fixer on and  you screw it in very tight, and still the bugs,  \r\n                            22:36\r\n                            they work very hard to work through this thread,  and go inside to die. This is how the human beings  \r\n                            22:42\r\n                            do. They work very hard to go to hell. So, God  gives us lots of examples in this world. Number 4, verse 4,\r\n                            22:58\r\n                            [64:4] He knows everything in the heavens and the earth. And He knows everything you conceal and everything you declare. God is fully aware of the innermost thoughts.\r\n                            23:09\r\n                            Did you ever come across people who think that God is not aware of  them? They say \"Who am I? God doesn't pay attention to me.\"\r\n                            23:17\r\n                            They think God doesn't see them. But this verse  here is telling us God is fully aware of  \r\n                            23:23\r\n                            every single ant. There are some termites in this  building somewhere. We are not aware of them, but  \r\n                            23:30\r\n                            God is. And He knows how much they're supposed  to eat and when to stop them. God is fully aware  \r\n                            23:40\r\n                            of every single creature, every single atom. He  knows everything in the heavens and the earth and  \r\n                            23:49\r\n                            He knows everything you conceal and everything  you declare. We just cannot have a complete  \r\n                            23:57\r\n                            comprehension of God's Omnipotence and Power.  Look how He created you and the blood pumping  \r\n                            24:05\r\n                            in your body in a perfect, perfect design. If you sleep  in your arm for a couple of hours at night and  \r\n                            24:15\r\n                            the circulation is not right, you know, you get a nightmare or something to move you. Because the circulation has to be perfect.\r\n                            24:32\r\n                            He knows everything you conceal and everything you declare.\r\n                            24:46\r\n                            So, if you do your part, God is aware of it. Everything is recorded.  Consciousness of God is very important. Wherever  \r\n                            24:56\r\n                            you go, just remember God is with you. You must  be conscious that God is with us here right  \r\n                            25:03\r\n                            now. He's aware of everything we're doing. He is  aware that you are here to study His message. You  \r\n                            25:09\r\n                            want to redeem yourself and go back to God, join  His kingdom. God is aware of that. And These are heavy  \r\n                            25:18\r\n                            verses. Verse number five says,\r\n                            25:26\r\n                            [64:5] Have you noted those who disbelieved in the past then suffered the consequences of their decision? They incurred a painful retribution.\r\n                            25:39\r\n                            God is teaching us from the past history. And these are factual observations. We know that Pharaoh drowned in the sea.\r\n                            25:49\r\n                            We know that. We know that Moses and the believers  crossed the Red Sea. There were no bridges then,  \r\n                            25:57\r\n                            no Golden Gate Bridge. But they crossed the  Red Sea from Egypt to Sinai. We know Pharaoh  \r\n                            Believers go through a purification process but will emerge a Gem. God will take each one of our flaws and “polish” us. The end of the disbeliever’s life always bad.\r\n                            26:08\r\n                            drowned and his body is full of salt in the Cairo  Museum. \"Have you noted those who disbelieved in  \r\n                            26:17\r\n                            the past then suffered the consequences of their  decision?\" And usually it is the end that counts.  \r\n                            26:29\r\n                            The believers may go through a purification  process, a polishing process, like the stone that  \r\n                            26:37\r\n                            goes through a lot to become a gem. But there is  these machines, these polishing machines that are  \r\n                            26:42\r\n                            very severe. So, the believer may go through that,  but he or she will emerge like a gem in the end.  \r\n                            26:51\r\n                            And we have, we have... all these guarantees will be fulfilled. The  purpose of the purification process is just that,  \r\n                            26:58\r\n                            purification, to make you a perfect human being,  a person who does not lie, cheat, trustworthy,  \r\n                            27:09\r\n                            righteous. Purification. And God will take  each one of these at a time and cleanse you  \r\n                            27:17\r\n                            from it through a polishing process. Remember  Jahan's Khutba on Friday when he didn't wanna\r\n                            27:27\r\n                            do the push-ups? See, he's young and he's  going through the polishing process. But he  \r\n                            27:36\r\n                            will emerge like a gem. Purification process done  by the Master Purifier. But those who disbelieve,  \r\n                            27:48\r\n                            their end is always bad, always. Their last  15 or 20 years are the most miserable years  \r\n                            27:55\r\n                            of their lives. And the opposite is true  with the believers.\r\n                            Nothing happens to you except as a consequence of your works i.e. Dr. Rashad Khalifa talks of his Nephew. We must learn “Correlation” between a “pinch” and making a mistake. God’s pinches are restorable i.e. loss of money or a headache.\r\n                            28:05\r\n                            I think tonight we're gonna come to the law that says that \"nothing  happens to you except in accordance with God's  \r\n                            28:13\r\n                            will.\" This is one of the two important laws. The  other law says \"nothing happens to you except as  \r\n                            28:18\r\n                            a consequence of something you have done.\" These  are negative, negative. \"Nothing except.\" \"Nothing happens except  \r\n                            28:25\r\n                            as a consequence of your work.\"\r\n                            28:35\r\n                            I was talking  to my nephew this morning in Egypt. And he was   telling me that he's doing everything right and  he wonders why he gets some problems. So, I went  \r\n                            28:48\r\n                            with him through a typical day or something and  discovered he doesn't do the Morning Prayer. Maybe  \r\n                            28:54\r\n                            once a week he does the Morning Prayer before  sunrise. So, I taught him the law. I said \"the law is  \r\n                            29:00\r\n                            nothing happens to you except as a consequence  of something you have done.\" I taught him that  \r\n                            29:06\r\n                            God loves him and wants him to do the Morning  Prayer. This is probably what God is choosing at  \r\n                            29:13\r\n                            this time to purify him. Every time he misses the  Morning Prayer, he gets a pinch until he does the  \r\n                            29:24\r\n                            correlation and realizes that God is aware of him and like he's watching as if he's the only one on earth.  \r\n                            29:31\r\n                            And whenever he misses the Prayer, he gets the  pinch. The correlation is immediate. And this is  \r\n                            29:37\r\n                            why we have also the other law that says \"worship  God in order to attain certainty.\" This is how you  \r\n                            29:44\r\n                            attain certainty. Because with this immediate  correlation, you're gonna realize that God   is watching you as if you're the only person in  the universe. And when you make a mistake, you get  \r\n                            29:57\r\n                            a pinch. It's a kind pinch. It hurts, but it gets  your attention. It doesn't hurt permanently. It is  \r\n                            30:12\r\n                            the kind that is restorable. God's pinches are all  restorable. You don't lose a finger, for example,  \r\n                            30:18\r\n                            because you cannot restore that. But you get a  pinch that is restorable. You get a headache,  \r\n                            30:25\r\n                            for example, because headaches go away.  You lose a few dollars. You can get them back  \r\n                            30:31\r\n                            multiplied manifold. So, this verse, number five,  reminds us of these two laws, two important laws.  \r\n                            30:45\r\n                            Don't forget them. I think we're gonna get  to the one that says \"nothing happens except in  \r\n                            30:51\r\n                            accordance with God's will.\" I believe it  is in this Sura. Oh, Ok. And the other law says  \r\n                            30:58\r\n                            \"nothing happens to you except as a consequence of  your work.\" Nothing happens. I mean, it's quite a  \r\n                            Following the messenger is following God’s instructions. Registering the mathematical Code, talks of errors and tracking numbers.\r\n                            31:05\r\n                            statement. It begins with the statement, nothing. (64:11) مَآ أَصَابَ مِن مُّصِيبَةٍ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِ ٱللَّهِ\r\n                            31:12\r\n                            It starts with a negative. Number six,\r\n                            31:17\r\n                            [64:6] This is because their messengers went to them with clear  proofs, but they said, \"shall we follow humans like us?\" They disbelieved and turned away. God does not need them. God is in no need, Praiseworthy.\r\n                            31:34\r\n                            See, they made a mistake when they said \"shall we  follow humans like us?\" Because the messengers are not\r\n                            31:41\r\n                            are not the ones that are being followed. It is  God's instructions that are being followed.\r\n                            31:48\r\n                            The messenger is one of the people around who is the  same as they are, and he himself is required to  \r\n                            31:55\r\n                            follow the instructions. So, we're all following  God when we look at God's teachings and follow them.\r\n                            32:05\r\n                            But here, their ego is an important  test. So, we're told that the painful retribution  \r\n                            32:13\r\n                            that is in verse five came to these people because  their messengers went to them with clear proofs.  \r\n                            32:21\r\n                            I mean, Moses threw the staff, became a serpent  in front of Pharaoh and swallowed everything   else. He still did not believe. God made the Nile  into blood in front of them. They couldn't drink  \r\n                            32:35\r\n                            for seven days. And they told Moses \"ask your God  to give us water again, we will believe.\" As soon  \r\n                            32:44\r\n                            as it became water again, they said \"NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA. We will not believe.\" I mean,  \r\n                            32:52\r\n                            what is this? Frogs, lice, locusts, nine plagues.  And every time they said \"ask God to relieve this,  \r\n                            33:03\r\n                            and we will believe\", and then they reneged. So,  God is fair. When they drowned in the Red Sea,  \r\n                            33:12\r\n                            they deserved that. But God gave them enough  warnings.\r\n                            33:19\r\n                            [64:6] This is because their messengers went to them with clear proofs.\r\n                            33:25\r\n                            In this day and age, we  have the mathematical code of the Quran, proving   this is God's word. But they still make all kinds  of excuses to avoid it.\r\n                            33:46\r\n                            For seven, well, God's... I will go back to six, God's proofs are always  clear and overwhelming, as we are experiencing  \r\n                            33:56\r\n                            right here in this mosque. The mathematical  miracle of Quran, as you will see, I'm writing  \r\n                            34:02\r\n                            it now in appendix one, is just overwhelming.  I'm using here just the word God as an example,  \r\n                            34:10\r\n                            and this alone is enough to prove that this is  not human made. Because the word God, now here we  \r\n                            34:18\r\n                            are in the 20th century, using computers, and we  are sophisticated, educated people, three of us,  \r\n                            34:26\r\n                            Lisa, Emily, and myself. We're working on these  numbers, the number of the word God. We are not  \r\n                            34:31\r\n                            writing them. We're not inventing anything. We're  just counting them, keeping track of them. And you  \r\n                            34:37\r\n                            have no idea how many mistakes we make. Computers  and all. So, it makes us appreciate the miracle  \r\n                            34:48\r\n                            even more. I was typing a number, 2492, 2492, for  example, and I switched the 9 and the 2, make  \r\n                            34:59\r\n                            it 2429. So, I was off by about 70. And there are  many other examples where I was off by one or two,  \r\n                            35:07\r\n                            but the Quran is perfect. 2698 of them, that  is 19 times 142, and if you take the verses,  \r\n                            35:19\r\n                            wherever you see the word God, for example,  in this page we have verse 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8,  \r\n                            35:27\r\n                            and 9. You take these numbers. In the whole Quran,  wherever you see the word God, and add them up,  \r\n                            35:34\r\n                            the total is 118123, which is also a multiple of  19. And this will be printed on the last page of  \r\n                            35:40\r\n                            the Quran. This alone proves that this is not  human made. I just don't see how they will face  \r\n                            35:49\r\n                            God on the Day of Judgment, people who can look  at this and still reject it. I'm just trying to  \r\n                            35:57\r\n                            emphasize the words \"clear proof\", so clear. Muhammad couldn't do this. How will he keep track  \r\n                            Making a choice, Rising for Fujr or staying a sleep. Size of the soul. “Angel can hold the Earth in his hand”.\r\n                            36:04\r\n                            of the word God in the Quran without computers when  we made mistakes? And it's already in front of us.\r\n                            36:17\r\n                            Verse 7, [64:7] Those who disbelieved claim that they will not be resurrected. Yes, indeed, by my Lord, you will be resurrected, and you will be held accountable for everything you have done. This is easy for God to do.\r\n                            36:35\r\n                            And God set the system, so  it is automatic. Tomorrow morning, before sunrise,  \r\n                            36:42\r\n                            you're gonna have two choices to make. You have  a decision to make. You're gonna get up before   sunrise and do the Morning Prayer, or you will  not. Only two choices. If you force your body  \r\n                            36:54\r\n                            to get out of bed and do the Morning Prayer, you  will grow. Your soul will grow. And to put it in  \r\n                            37:02\r\n                            our world's terms, you will make a deposit in your  post-retirement account, a few million dollars,  \r\n                            37:12\r\n                            just with that one Prayer tomorrow. It's actually  more than that. I'm just using these numbers of  \r\n                            37:17\r\n                            this world. The other choice is that you  become a slave of your body and you sleep,  \r\n                            37:22\r\n                            because your body is telling you \"oh, it's so much  fun to be in the pillow.\" Your body is telling you  \r\n                            37:28\r\n                            that. So, if you're a slave of your body, you're  gonna sleep, and you lose, because the body  \r\n                            37:35\r\n                            is gonna go to dust. You are gonna live on  with your growth and development or your shrunken  \r\n                            37:42\r\n                            condition. God made it automatic. So, in the very  end, you're gonna be born into the Hereafter  \r\n                            37:49\r\n                            what? Either developed, complete person, or a  deformed, shrunken person. It's in your hand.  \r\n                            38:09\r\n                            [64:7] Those who disbelieved claim that they will not be  resurrected. Yes, indeed, by my Lord....\r\n                            38:14\r\n                            Remember, these are mathematically composed letters. God  is telling them. \"Yes, indeed, by my Lord...\"\r\n                            38:23\r\n                            This is the Quran speaking, by the way. \"Yes, indeed, by  my Lord. You will be resurrected, and you will be  \r\n                            38:31\r\n                            held accountable.\" You'll be held accountable in  this manner. Remember in Sura 17 where it says\r\n                            38:37\r\n                            \"nobody will need to be asked, what wrong did you  do?\" It'll be obvious who developed and who did  \r\n                            38:42\r\n                            not develop. In Sura 55, remember the verse  that says \"on that day, the guilty will not  \r\n                            38:51\r\n                            be asked about any of their guilt or their  sins?\" You don't need to. Also, in Sura 17,  \r\n                            39:00\r\n                            we learn that the differences in the Hereafter  will be fantastic, will be great. See, the  \r\n                            39:10\r\n                            difference between Hani, a child, and his father,  is five feet. In this world, five feet. But in the  \r\n                            39:19\r\n                            Hereafter, the difference between the people  will be like, somebody will be as big as a cat,  \r\n                            39:25\r\n                            and the other will be as big as Phoenix, Arizona,  or the state of Arizona. So, the person as big  \r\n                            39:30\r\n                            as a cat \"you're gonna ask him, what did he do  wrong?\" I mean, it's obvious. The difference will be huge.  \r\n                            39:41\r\n                            See, we're really tiny. We are very tiny. An angel  can hold the earth in his hand, see, and you can  \r\n                            39:50\r\n                            be as big as that. Remember, we were all in the  same company, billions of years ago.\r\n                            40:06\r\n                            \"Yes, indeed, by my Lord, you will be resurrected and you'll  be held accountable for everything you have done.  \r\n                            40:11\r\n                            This is easy for God to do.\" In fact, it's already  done. On the Day of Judgment, when God comes to  \r\n                            40:20\r\n                            our world, the people will be automatically  stratified according to their size or degree  \r\n                            40:27\r\n                            and development. If you're strong enough,  you'll be able to stand the presence of God,  \r\n                            40:32\r\n                            and you will enjoy it. You'll be in Heaven. If you  fail to develop yourself, I'm not talking to you,  \r\n                            40:40\r\n                            of course, it's the people on the street who  need to know that. But the people who fail to   develop themselves will have to run away from  God. They cannot stand the presence of God,  \r\n                            40:51\r\n                            too much energy. And this is why God is advising us to  do the Five Prayers, to fast the month of Ramadan,  \r\n                            God did not ask for Fujr to annoy us. Rising early Alleviates Depression.\r\n                            41:00\r\n                            to be charitable, do all this. He gave us specific  things to develop our soul for our good, because  \r\n                            41:08\r\n                            see the end of the verse? Verse 6, excuse me. Because God  is in no need. He doesn't wanna bother you and  \r\n                            41:18\r\n                            have you get up before sunrise just to annoy you.  Why does God want you to get up before sunrise?  \r\n                            41:29\r\n                            What does He benefit from that? Nothing. It's you  who will benefit from that.\r\n                            41:45\r\n                            As a matter of fact, my nephew was complaining what... specific  problem was the depression, that gets depressed  \r\n                            41:52\r\n                            once a month or so. And this is directly related,  if you remember Douglas' Khutbah, it is directly  \r\n                            42:00\r\n                            related to being up in the morning early. Remember  the hat with the light? And that research that was  \r\n                            42:07\r\n                            done indicated that people who had extra light  in the morning, not at night.... Is this right,  \r\n                            42:13\r\n                            Douglas? In the morning. So, it's not just.... you  cannot lengthen the day from the night side. It  \r\n                            42:19\r\n                            is getting up early in the morning that induces  certain chemicals in your head and causes the  \r\n                            42:26\r\n                            depression or not. There is a direct correlation.  Those who study statistics, the correlation is 1.0  \r\n                            42:38\r\n                            between sleeping too much and headaches and  depression. You sleep more than 8 hours a  \r\n                            42:44\r\n                            day, you're guaranteed to have headaches and  maybe depression. So, God is advising you for  \r\n                            42:56\r\n                            your own good. God is in no need. Number 8, \r\n                            43:03\r\n                            [64:8] Therefore, if you are smart, you shall believe in God and His messenger, and the light that we have revealed herein, God is fully cognizant of everything you do.\r\n                            43:18\r\n                            It's God's message to the  people. After showing us the positive incentives  \r\n                            43:27\r\n                            and the negative incentives, God is giving you  the conclusion. \"Therefore, you shall believe  \r\n                            43:32\r\n                            in God and His messenger.\" Why does God want you  to believe? He doesn't need us. It's because He  \r\n                            43:40\r\n                            loves us. God loves you. He wants you to believe  and follow this light of the Quran to be redeemed,  \r\n                            43:50\r\n                            to be saved, to be happy here in this world and  in the Hereafter. You see this verse that talks  \r\n                            43:57\r\n                            about retribution in verse 5? You see, a lot of  people make a mistake thinking that they have  \r\n                            Happiness and retribution start here.\r\n                            44:06\r\n                            to die first and go to the grave for millions of  years and then get up before they receive their  \r\n                            44:12\r\n                            reward or their punishment. And they say \"oh, forget it, come on.\" For millions of years,  \r\n                            44:20\r\n                            they think. They don't realize that the happiness  and the retribution happen here. It is repeated so  \r\n                            44:26\r\n                            many times throughout the Quran that we pay here.  It starts here. When you make deposit in your  \r\n                            44:33\r\n                            post-retirement account, you draw interest  here and benefits in this world.\r\n                            44:45\r\n                            [64:8] Therefore, you shall believe in God and His messenger and the light that we have revealed herein. God is fully cognizant of everything you do.\r\n                            44:53\r\n                            Number 9, [64:9] The day will come when He summons you to the Day of Summoning. That is the Day of Mutual Blaming....\r\n                            45:00\r\n                            Here you have two names of the Day of Judgment. The Day of Summoning, we will be summoned. It is as sure as the sunrise tomorrow morning. All of us, past,  \r\n                            45:13\r\n                            present, and future generations will be summoned  before God. And that is the Day of Mutual Blaming.  \r\n                            45:22\r\n                            [64:9]..... Anyone who believes in God and leads a righteous life, God will remit his sins and will admit him into gardens with flowing streams. They abide therein forever. This is the greatest triumph.  \r\n                            45:38\r\n                            So, our part is so easy. And this is why Mutual  Blaming causes people who did not believe will  \r\n                            45:47\r\n                            find someone who misled them, took them away  from the Redemption.....\r\n                            46:00\r\n                            Edip: And also this describes the selfishness of disbelievers. They are selfish and they will want to change everything, to give  \r\n                            46:11\r\n                            as a ransom everything that they love, that they  have.\r\n                            46:16\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: They probably gave up God and this world for the sake of their spouse or parents or children or whatever. But on the Day of Judgment, they want to give up those.\r\n                            46:28\r\n                            Edip: The love of disbelievers,  when they love something, their love is because  \r\n                            46:34\r\n                            of their selfishness. They love, for example, their children because they have benefit.\r\n                            46:45\r\n                            They do not love anything they don't expect benefit.  For example, they do not do anything secretly,  \r\n                            46:55\r\n                            good things, because they are in fact selfish. But  apparently, you may not see it. Any people who do  \r\n                            47:06\r\n                            not believe in Hereafter, they are selfish in this  world. Let's go on, 15.\r\n                            47:19\r\n                            [70:15] No; it is aflame. [70:16] Eager to burn. [70:17] It calls on those who turned away. [70:18] Those who hoarded and counted. [70:19] Indeed, the human being is anxious.\r\n                            47:39\r\n                            Verse 17 tells us that hell will  call, will invite people. In Quran, we find that  \r\n                            47:52\r\n                            Allah personalized the substances. Understand? For  example, in chapter 41, verse 21, we see God makes  \r\n                            48:12\r\n                            everything speak up, makes everything speak up. For example, in 41:11, we see earth and heaven speak. In 23, chapter  \r\n                            48:23\r\n                            23:62, the record speaks. And chapter 50,  verse 30, hell speaks. And chapter 27:82,  \r\n                            48:34\r\n                            computer speaks. God makes everything speak  up. But what is speaking in our language?  \r\n                            48:44\r\n                            We're speaking.... You may understand speaking is only by words. But Quran explains the word \"speaking.\" The word speak,  \r\n                            48:56\r\n                            in 3:41, we see gestures, symbols, also is another  way for speaking. Allah says for Zakariya,  \r\n                            49:09\r\n                            your sign is not to speak with anybody for  three days except, except gestures, by symbols you  \r\n                            49:19\r\n                            can speak. This exception shows us that symbols  or anything that symbol gestures are also way of speaking.\r\n                            49:32\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Signals Edip: Signals, yes. Thanks. Verse 18,\r\n                            49:40\r\n                            \"Those who  hoarded and counted\" is one of the important  \r\n                            49:48\r\n                            character of disbelievers. They hoarded the  earthly goods and they are very careful about the  \r\n                            50:05\r\n                            substances of this world. And also we can see this  character in chapter 74, verse 12, 15. And\r\n                            50:18\r\n                            verse 19 is very interesting. \"Indeed the human being is  anxious.\" In Arabic, we see it has been created\r\n                            50:32\r\n                            as anxious. The word is \"has been created.\" I searched  about this because Allah says in chapter 95, verse 4 and 5.\r\n                            50:49\r\n                            (95:4) لَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ فِىٓ أَحْسَنِ تَقْوِيمٍۢ We have created the human being in  the best manner. Allah, and in another verse,  \r\n                            51:02\r\n                            please open chapter 32, verse 7.\r\n                            51:18\r\n                            He perfected everything He created. He perfected everything He created. Allah's creation is perfect. But here  we see that human being has been created anxious.  \r\n                            51:33\r\n                            Apparently, we may see a contradiction between  those verses. But if we carefully research on the  \r\n                            51:44\r\n                            word \"KHALAQA\", we see in Quran when God says about  our creation, when mentioned about our creation,  \r\n                            51:55\r\n                            He says \"خَلَقْنَا ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ\", \"KHALAQNA\", we created.  And Allah when mentioned about His creation,  \r\n                            52:04\r\n                            He says always \"we created best, in best manner.\" But here it is KHOLIQA, has been created,  \r\n                            52:12\r\n                            not \"we created.\" How do you say in English  for this? KHOLIQA, unknown. The subject is unknown here.\r\n                            52:22\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Passive, Is it passive tense? Edip: Passive, yes. Passive tense. For example, we can see the   passive tense in chapter 4:28. It describes  the weakness of human being.\r\n                            52:34\r\n                            (4:28) خُلِقَ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنُ You can see that verse. And also the human being  has been created hasty, chapter 21:38.  \r\n                            52:47\r\n                            And when Allah describes the weakness and  anxiousness and hastiness of the human being,  \r\n                            52:57\r\n                            He always describes this as KHOLIQA, not KHALAQNA. It shows us with our free will,  \r\n                            53:05\r\n                            we change our creation. Yes. OK, what is the grammatical,   Dr. Khalifa: Where is Martha? Is  Martha here? Martha: Yes.\r\n                            53:10\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Ok. What is the term, linguistic term for something  that was created? Instead of I created.\r\n                            53:19\r\n                            Martha: Yes. It's passive voice. Dr. Khalifa: Oh, OK, so, passive is right. I wasn't sure.\r\n                            53:24\r\n                            Martha: But I'm not sure if I (unintelligible).\r\n                            53:34\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, but the  human being can make himself worried, as you will see in the next verses. In other words, the INSAN, the human  being is made something, it's made by the human, not by God.\r\n                            53:49\r\n                            Martha: (unintelligible)\r\n                            53:56\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, right. Edip: We can see in Quran, (23:14) فَتَبَارَكَ ٱللَّهُ أَحْسَنُ ٱلْخَـٰلِقِينَ\r\n                            54:02\r\n                            Allah is the best of the creators, the best Creator of creators. أَحْسَنُ ٱلْخَـٰلِقِينَ There are many creators.\r\n                            54:13\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: In other words, we can create our own misery or our own happiness. Martha: But the angel talks to us. \r\n                            54:20\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Well, God instructs. They follow God's laws. They carry out God's laws.\r\n                            54:27\r\n                            Edip: (Arabic unintelligible) Also they create lies. Dr. Khalifa: This is just to  bypass these linguistic tricks. Edip: Ok.\r\n                            54:47\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Dark grey car with the lights on. Small, dark,...\r\n                            55:07\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Eula, get  the make of the car next time, not now. But.... \r\n                            55:17\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: It could be. But Emily will find out.\r\n                            55:27\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: OK, go on, Edip. Edip: Yes, verse 20. [70:20] If touched by adversity, despondent. [70:21] If blessed by wealth, stingy.\r\n                            55:39\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: What kind of car is it? No. Edip: [70:22] Except for the worshipers.\r\n                            55:46\r\n                            [70:23] Who always observe their contact prayers (Salat).\r\n                            55:53\r\n                            [70:24] Part of their money is set aside. [70:25] For the poor and the needy. [70:26] They believe in the Day of Judgment.\r\n                            56:02\r\n                            [70:27] They reverence their Lord's requital. [70:28] Their Lord's requital is not taken for granted. [70:29] They keep their chastity.\r\n                            56:18\r\n                            [70:30] (They have relations) only with their spouses, or what is legally theirs— [70:31] anyone who transgresses these limits is a sinner—\r\n                            56:28\r\n                            [70:32] And the believers keep their word; they are trustworthy. [70:33] Their testimony is truthful.\r\n                            56:36\r\n                            And it ends with the same close statement.\r\n                            56:43\r\n                            [70:34] They consistently observe their contact prayers (Salat), on time.\r\n                            56:48\r\n                            It's like the same verse 23. There are  some qualifications, some behaviors of Muslims,  \r\n                            57:00\r\n                            important behaviors. First, they observe their  Contact Prayers. And we see this statement also  \r\n                            57:11\r\n                            in 23, verse 2. And there are many common verses  between here and the beginning of chapter 23.  \r\n                            57:24\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: You see, I'm making a note of this for the index. Traits of the believers. (unintelligible). Ok. Go ahead.\r\n                            57:38\r\n                            Edip: Part of their money is set aside. Word by word\r\n                            57:44\r\n                            translation, they have a part in their money. A  part there is known, known by people. This shows\r\n                            57:55\r\n                            us this charity, the amount of Zakat is known by  people.\r\n                            58:02\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Specified. Edip: Specified. Edip: (70:24) حَقٌّۭ مَّعْلُومٌۭ Edip: 24.\r\n                            58:09\r\n                            [70:24] Part of their money is set aside. The amount of the charity  is known by people.\r\n                            58:24\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: So, give me this back to printing. Specified portion? Edip: Ok. Yes. Dr. Khalifa: Specified portion of their money is set aside. Edip: Specified. مَّعْلُومٌۭ\r\n                            58:39\r\n                            And there are parallel verses here between 23 and chapter 23. For example, you see the parallel verse in 23, chapter 23,\r\n                            58:51\r\n                            verse 4. It says, it specifies this as Zakat, just the word Zakat.\r\n                            59:07\r\n                            Verse 30, [70:30] (They have relations) only with their spouses, or what is legally theirs—\r\n                            59:17\r\n                            Edip: This is about captives of war. Dr. Khalifa: No, no, it is not. Edip: It's not?\r\n                            59:26\r\n                            Edip: In chapter 4:25, Allah gives us permission to marry with captives of the war. Dr. Khalifa: No, it is not.\r\n                            59:35\r\n                            Edip: Please, open chapter 4, verse 25. Dr. Khalifa: Look in the new  translation. Edip inherited some of the old stuff,  \r\n                            59:46\r\n                            where they had wars and captives. And \"what is legally  theirs\" covers all the methods of marriage in the world.\r\n                            59:56\r\n                            There are places where there's no  marriage. But a man and a woman will live   together forever and have their children, and the  society will know that these belong to each other.  \r\n                            1:00:05\r\n                            You don't have anything like that any.... So,  the Quran covers all the situations. There are  \r\n                            1:00:11\r\n                            common-law marriages in this country. And the Quran  recognizes that. This is what legally theirs means.\r\n                            1:00:33\r\n                            Edip: And is there any question about this?\r\n                            1:00:39\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: I have a few comments. Edip: Let me talk about...\r\n                            1:00:45\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: 4:25 talks about slaves. 4:25 talks about slaves. Edip: Yes, slaves, you  can marry with them.\r\n                            1:00:53\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Right, but not war captives. Edip: Oh, ok.\r\n                            Human beings who don’t observe Salat “always worried”. Traits of Believers. Chastity. Talk of Various translations.\r\n                            1:01:00\r\n                            Edip: Ok. This is very important to note that the people who do not.... the worshippers who do not observe the  \r\n                            1:01:09\r\n                            Contact Prayers are anxious. Anxious, I really  want a more stronger word than anxious. In Arabic,  \r\n                            1:01:18\r\n                            HALU'A is worried, always worried. Nervous and  anxious and worried, always worried. A human... huh?\r\n                            1:01:26\r\n                            Yeah. Jittery and worried. Worried, depressed and  anxiety and worry.\r\n                            1:01:36\r\n                            If touched by adversity, they become despondent. And when blessed with wealth, they are stingy. Ok, now, you can ask  \r\n                            1:01:44\r\n                            yourself these questions. \"Do you worry?\" Number 2, \"Do you  become despondent when something bad happens to you?\"\r\n                            1:01:53\r\n                            Number 3, \"Are you stingy when you have money?\" If you  have these three traits, then you do not belong  \r\n                            1:02:00\r\n                            with the worshippers, the believers. I remember  my father's teacher had a debate with some of the  \r\n                            1:02:11\r\n                            Mullahs. And he trapped him into this. He said,  \"do you worry a lot?\" He said \"yeah, we're humans,  \r\n                            1:02:18\r\n                            we worry.\" He said \"if something bad happens  to you, do you become upset?\" He said \"yeah,  \r\n                            1:02:24\r\n                            we're human beings, we do that.\" And then he  said... So, I said \"well, then you don't belong  \r\n                            1:02:31\r\n                            with the worshippers who observe their Salat prayer because in verse 22, it says,\r\n                            1:02:37\r\n                            (70:22) إِلَّا ٱلْمُصَلِّينَ Except those who observe the Salat Prayers. So, the lesson  is that if you do observe your Contact Prayers,  \r\n                            1:02:45\r\n                            this will cool you down. You will not worry,  you'll have nothing to worry about. No fear,   no worry. And you will not be despondent when  adversity happens. You'll remember what the  \r\n                            1:02:58\r\n                            Quran says, that you may dislike something which  is good for you. You may not get the job that you  \r\n                            1:03:04\r\n                            want, but God knows it is not good for you, and  you accept that. So, you will not be despondent,  \r\n                            1:03:10\r\n                            you will not be miserable, because you didn't make  it in the job interview. So, then we have a bunch of\r\n                            1:03:18\r\n                            traits of the believers. They always observe  their Contact Prayers, verse 23. 24,\r\n                            1:03:25\r\n                            A specific portion, 2.5% of their net income is set aside  for the poor and the needy, 25. 26,\r\n                            1:03:33\r\n                            [70:26] They believe in the Day of Judgment. These are all traits of the believers. 27,\r\n                            1:03:39\r\n                            [70:27] They reverence their Lord's requital. They worry about it. In other words,  they don't want it. They know how bad it is,  \r\n                            1:03:48\r\n                            just making God angry. God doesn't get angry, by  the way, but, I mean, violating His commandments.  \r\n                            1:03:57\r\n                            27, eh, 28, [70:28] Their Lord's requital is not taken for granted. In other words, when you look at this, you'll be  \r\n                            1:04:08\r\n                            severe against yourself. You will not be lax. You  will judge yourself according to these criteria,  \r\n                            1:04:17\r\n                            and make sure that you're a believer. You  will be strict with yourself. Number 29,\r\n                            1:04:30\r\n                            [70:29] They keep their chastity. So, I mean, you look  at this verse 29, and you keep your chastity.\r\n                            1:04:37\r\n                            You will not be lax or careless. Keeping the chastity  is something that is unusual in this country,  \r\n                            1:04:49\r\n                            because the society evolved so much in the last  few decades. Maybe, I should get you the piece of  \r\n                            1:04:59\r\n                            paper that Phil handed me. Just one second.  It's appropriate to this. Let me. It's for all those  \r\n                            1:05:15\r\n                            born before 1945, which probably includes me  only. And...Okay, but here it says \"we were certainly  \r\n                            1:05:32\r\n                            not before the difference between the sexes was  discovered. But we were surely before the sex   changed. We may do with what we have. And we were  the last generation that was so dumb as to think  \r\n                            1:05:44\r\n                            you needed a husband to have a baby.\" No wonder we  are so confused, and there is such a generation  \r\n                            1:05:50\r\n                            gap. But we survived, okay. I think there are  some other points here that along the line that  \r\n                            1:06:03\r\n                            \"we were the last generation that was so dumb as  to think you needed a husband to have a baby.\" So,  \r\n                            1:06:09\r\n                            in other words, what happened in the last few  decades is really very harmful to the people.  \r\n                            1:06:18\r\n                            And we see what happened with AIDS, the spread  of venereal diseases, lesbian mothers, things  \r\n                            1:06:29\r\n                            that those who were born before 1945 never heard of these  things. But verse 29, the believers do not take it  \r\n                            1:06:39\r\n                            lightly, 29. I'm writing an appendix on chastity  and virginity for our children. Our children  \r\n                            1:06:51\r\n                            better be different from the other children. It  is your responsibility to teach your children for  \r\n                            1:06:58\r\n                            their own good that they must be virgin on their  wedding night. And I'm talking about boys and  \r\n                            1:07:04\r\n                            girls. And I'm going to show in the appendix how  the happiness of your children depends on that.  \r\n                            1:07:13\r\n                            The price is just too high if they don't follow  this verse, this very short verse, 29, they keep  \r\n                            1:07:22\r\n                            [70:29] They keep their chastity. The price is really too high. Now,  even from the physiological and the physical point  \r\n                            1:07:30\r\n                            of view, the boys and the girls, when they mature  first and they're ready for... they're not ready.  \r\n                            1:07:40\r\n                            I mean, physiologically, they may have their  menstruation, or they may... the voice may change,  \r\n                            1:07:47\r\n                            the boy's voice may change, but physiologically  and anatomically, they are not really ready for  \r\n                            1:07:53\r\n                            sex. But in this country, they delve into sex  without being ready, and they hurt themselves,  \r\n                            1:08:01\r\n                            and they pay the price when they grow up. This is  from the purely physical and physiological point   of view. But from the practical point of view,  God sees to it that those who violate this...  \r\n                            1:08:13\r\n                            Cause you know, our boys and girls must be taught not to  violate this. That they must keep their chastity,  \r\n                            1:08:21\r\n                            because when they do that, they pay from their  happiness. They will not have a happy marriage.  \r\n                            1:08:28\r\n                            They will not have a happy life. And, mind you,  it is not easy. You must teach them that it is  \r\n                            1:08:34\r\n                            not easy to keep your chastity, especially in a  society like this. Joe Sobran is a reporter with  \r\n                            1:08:42\r\n                            the Los Angeles Times, and he had a wonderful  commentary only yesterday, or the day before.  \r\n                            1:08:49\r\n                            He says \"these boys, they go out and they have  sex as if there are no consequences. But the  \r\n                            1:08:54\r\n                            consequences are abortions, dangerous things  that happen to... and children who these boys have no intention  \r\n                            1:09:02\r\n                            of raising them or supporting them. They create a  lot of misery.\" That was Joe Sobran's commentary,  \r\n                            1:09:08\r\n                            and he is not a Muslim. But here we are reading  the Quran, and God knows what is good for us.   And He is telling us that the believers must  keep their chastity. You know, all of you are young,  \r\n                            1:09:26\r\n                            and you have children who are growing, and I want  to repeat and emphasize, and re-emphasize that it is  \r\n                            1:09:33\r\n                            your responsibility. If you just do your part, God  will do the other part. You cannot just leave them  \r\n                            1:09:40\r\n                            to the world out there. You have to do your part  by teaching them what the Quran is saying, what  \r\n                            1:09:45\r\n                            God is saying. Because if you really love them,  you want them to be happy when they grow up.\r\n                            1:09:52\r\n                            And one source of misery will be to break these laws.  They are not physiologically ready. They'll be  \r\n                            1:09:59\r\n                            breaking God's law, and the price is too high. And  I know you do want them to be happy. So, I am going  \r\n                            1:10:12\r\n                            to write this appendix in detail, and you can use  it. Ok. Use me to give them these instructions. It is  \r\n                            1:10:21\r\n                            very difficult to be a father or a mother, and you  talk to children about sex. It's kind of awkward.  \r\n                            1:10:30\r\n                            But if you use the Quran, tell them \"this is what  God says. Here is the appendix. Read it.\" And God  \r\n                            1:10:36\r\n                            will help you, and will protect them. So, and emphasize to them that it is not easy. You must  \r\n                            1:10:43\r\n                            exert, tell them they have to exert a lot of control. Because the temptation is so great out there. And you are helping them this  \r\n                            1:10:53\r\n                            way when you tell them \"it is not easy. But you  must exert for your own happiness and your own good, you must exert a lot of control. You must  resist.\" You know, they have a big thing saying\r\n                            1:11:02\r\n                            \"say no to drugs.\" But you never see \"say  no to sex.\" Even though it is disastrous. Is there?\r\n                            1:11:15\r\n                            Well, Subhan Allah. Ok.\r\n                            1:11:23\r\n                            Yes, this is a shock. A woman: If you have 20 hours, they say, you know \"use contraceptive whenever (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            1:11:36\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Because this, I think it was Valentine's Day at the university, and they  distributed free condoms. It's like telling them\r\n                            1:11:42\r\n                            \"go have sex\", you know. They don't realize what they're doing, and how much unhappiness they're\r\n                            1:11:47\r\n                            causing to these kids. But this is good news.  Now, God is forcing. God says in Sura 41 verse 53,  \r\n                            1:11:56\r\n                            that God will show them His signs in the  horizons and within themselves until they   realize that this is the truth. This is what is good  for us. There is a big campaign in the country  \r\n                            1:12:06\r\n                            against alcohol. They don't do it because God  said so. But they are forced by the disasters,  \r\n                            1:12:13\r\n                            the social disasters, and the broken families,  and the depression that is caused by alcohol,  \r\n                            1:12:21\r\n                            the hangovers and headaches, diseases. Now, the  book, there's a book in the market, new book,  \r\n                            1:12:26\r\n                            that is called \"You Are What You Drink.\" I've  mentioned it before. And it lists unbelievable  \r\n                            1:12:32\r\n                            disastrous health problems from alcohol. Because  it dissolves your brain. I mean, I'm talking  \r\n                            1:12:38\r\n                            about cancer, blood pressure, heart disease. Established, scientifically established.\r\n                            1:12:44\r\n                            A woman: Liver disease. Dr. Khalifa: Liver disease, of course, it's known long time ago. And the same is happening with violating this verse 29,  \r\n                            1:12:54\r\n                            [70:29] They keep their chastity. The same thing is  happening. There are unheard of diseases coming out.\r\n                            Made aware of AIDS affecting Females.\r\n                            1:13:03\r\n                            AIDS is one of them. Uncurable. Skin cancer exposure. You're telling me that now, the... Naghmeh, you're telling me now the females  \r\n                            1:13:13\r\n                            have a disease that is similar to AIDS. I heard  about it a couple of weeks ago. Do you wanna tell us more? A woman: There's a cancer (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:13:34\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Young girls who are sexually active. Because they are not physiologically, they're not physiologically  \r\n                            1:13:39\r\n                            ready. It takes maybe 10 years after the voice in  the boy changes and the menstruation of the girl,  \r\n                            1:13:47\r\n                            maybe 10 years to really be ready to be pregnant  and to be in a marriage relationship. So, God  \r\n                            1:13:55\r\n                            knows, God created us and knows what is good for  us. So, if you think I spend too much time on this,\r\n                            1:14:03\r\n                            it's deliberate. Because you have a lot of  responsibility. There are lots of beautiful,   wonderful kids running around here. And they must  be protected. Like I said \"don't worry.\" You just  \r\n                            1:14:13\r\n                            do your part. And you must know that your children  are in God's hand. You can't be with them every  \r\n                            1:14:20\r\n                            time. But God chaperones your children. You're  a person. You're a person of God. And you must  \r\n                            1:14:27\r\n                            have that confidence. You must know that God is  with your children wherever they go. If they're  \r\n                            1:14:33\r\n                            riding a bicycle in the middle of the street, or  they're out with other people subjected to all the  \r\n                            1:14:39\r\n                            temptations of this society. Don't worry. Drugs or  sex or accidents. Your children are in God's hand  \r\n                            1:14:46\r\n                            and you must have that confidence. And being the  oldest of you, I've raised two kids. I know that.  \r\n                            1:14:53\r\n                            I know. I'm speaking from experience. They've  seen how much God's protection is marvelous. \r\n                            1:15:00\r\n                            And they've seen how you just do your part and God  will do His part in the most magnificent ways.  \r\n                            1:15:08\r\n                            So, I don't have relations with anybody else. In  fact, this is repeated in verse 30. It says\r\n                            1:15:15\r\n                            [70:30] (They have relations) only with their spouses, or what is legally theirs—\r\n                            1:15:21\r\n                            So, there's a lot at stake. It is just not worth it violating these laws. These are very harsh. The punishment is very harsh. It seems  \r\n                            1:15:34\r\n                            out of proportion. So, if you want to test it, go  ahead. You're gonna pay through the nose. If,\r\n                            1:15:42\r\n                            if you want to abide by God's law, then you attain a  lot of happiness and you avoid lots of problems.  \r\n                            1:15:48\r\n                            Okay. Any questions?\r\n                            1:15:57\r\n                            Yes.\r\n                            1:16:12\r\n                            Right. They're being selfish, like the fellow who donated a million dollars to the cancer centre but it had to be announced over the microphone in the stadium. This is showing  \r\n                            1:16:22\r\n                            off and he's doing it for selfish reasons. Maybe.  Maybe. I mean, he has to be a believer in God to  \r\n                            1:16:29\r\n                            give things secretly. But the criterion is whether  the person is cutting a portion of his money and  \r\n                            1:16:35\r\n                            giving it to the poor or not. The minimum is  2.5%. If the person is giving away at least 2.5%  \r\n                            1:16:42\r\n                            of his or her money to the poor, then they're alright. Farhad.\r\n                            1:17:06\r\n                            Yes. This is verse 30.\r\n                            1:17:12\r\n                            Yes.\r\n                            1:17:18\r\n                            Yes. OR is very important. Yes. This is...The Quran is so accurate  that you have to pay attention to what Farhad\r\n                            1:17:27\r\n                            is just saying. OR or AND. There's a verse that  says you shall observe Hajj and Umrah. And I have  \r\n                            1:17:35\r\n                            translated it, maybe even in the old translation,  OR Umrah. But we're supposed to observe, in  \r\n                            1:17:40\r\n                            pilgrimage, there are two things you must observe.  Hajj and Umrah. They must be done. So, this is a  \r\n                            1:17:45\r\n                            similar... The difference is just a dash. WA or AW. It's  the difference. You really have to pay attention to these things.\r\n                            1:17:55\r\n                            Edip: Yes, here, if you have spouses, you don't have legally. Dr. Khalifa: Right. See, because you either  \r\n                            1:18:03\r\n                            got married or either got together without the  benefit of marriage. I don't wanna tell you that  \r\n                            1:18:09\r\n                            joke again. The guy in Africa who wanted to know the secret of happy marriage. And someone said \"what is marriage?\" \r\n                            1:18:16\r\n                            So, there are places in the world where there is no marriage. Edip: What does legally mean?\r\n                            1:18:23\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, \"legally\" means that there may be societies where when the people reach the age of 21, they are actually  \r\n                            1:18:34\r\n                            engaged at the time of birth, in some of those  societies. They had a boy in the family and said,  \r\n                            1:18:39\r\n                            \"this will be for my daughter.\" The tribe chief  or something. Because the daughter is not born yet,  \r\n                            1:18:46\r\n                            maybe. But these are political connections. So, when they reach 21, they ship the boy and the  \r\n                            1:18:53\r\n                            girl into their new house and they become husband  and wife, forever. She is legally his and he is  \r\n                            1:18:58\r\n                            legally hers. But there was no marriage ceremony  or no such thing as marriage. So, the Quran must  \r\n                            1:19:06\r\n                            cover all situations. They legally belong to  each other. In this country, the common law  \r\n                            1:19:12\r\n                            marriages are legal as far as God is concerned.  There are two people who decided to live together   forever and raise a family. The intention is for  being together forever. They don't go through the  \r\n                            1:19:25\r\n                            state and the papers and the priest or the Justice  of the Peace or anything. But they live together  \r\n                            1:19:30\r\n                            forever. And that's legal as far as God is concerned.\r\n                            1:19:36\r\n                            A man: In many places like psychiatric hospitals and (unintelligible), the adolescents have the most serious emotional problems. (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:19:47\r\n                            Typically, they're children of parents who  were illicit. They engaged in a lot of illicit  \r\n                            1:19:53\r\n                            sexual activity. They committed adultery. A lot of  these young people, they don't have any sense of\r\n                            1:19:59\r\n                            genuine love or affection. They, in fact, even at times,  \r\n                            1:20:04\r\n                            express hatred and resentment toward their  parents. Because they can't see their parents   loving each other. These are the ones that are,  in fact, the most serious.\r\n                            1:20:15\r\n                            I haven't, God knows, I haven't come in contact with a single case of  an extremely serious emotional problems.\r\n                            1:20:24\r\n                            You know, this type of thing that is not included sometimes in  adultery or, you know, disregard for marriage. (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:20:36\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: By the way, I must clarify that when I talk about  problems in marriage, there are all those   problems in marriage. But for people who  keep their chastity until their marriage,  \r\n                            1:20:48\r\n                            they will have the regular problems of bickering  over the budget and what to be spent where and  \r\n                            1:20:54\r\n                            which house to pick out and which room should  be the living room and which room should be...   These are normal problems. I'm talking about  serious problems that are the price of the improper marriage.\r\n                            1:21:13\r\n                            A woman: You just mentioned that parents (unintelligible) children (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:21:22\r\n                            There's a verse in Sura 4, verse 19, is Quran saying that, you know, it's commandment \"They can't do that. They can't get in here unless quiet\"?\r\n                            1:21:33\r\n                            (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:21:39\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, this is inheritance of the things that the wife  possessed. It is not inheriting the person. I,\r\n                            1:21:49\r\n                            I think I clarified this in the new translation.  \"You shall not inherit your wife's forcibly\" means  \r\n                            1:21:55\r\n                            you cannot force her to write a will giving you  everything, giving the husband everything. That's   what it means. But arranged marriages are done all  over the world. And a lot of them are very successful.  \r\n                            1:22:20\r\n                            Well, this is prohibited in the Quran. Marriage  against anybody's will is prohibited in the Quran   anyway. So, this...If a man inherits the wife in the sense  that you're saying, and she's happy and he's  \r\n                            1:22:32\r\n                            happy and they get married, fine. I mean, widows  can get married. There's no problem.\r\n                            1:22:42\r\n                            There's a Jewish tradition about the brother marrying his  brother's widow. It's an old tradition in Judaism.  \r\n                            1:22:49\r\n                            There's nothing wrong with it if everybody's  happy. A person: (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:22:59\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, well, no, this is against the Quran. Pardon?\r\n                            1:23:05\r\n                            Speak slowly. A woman: There are quite a few societies... Dr. Khalifa: Yes. There are a few societies there.\r\n                            1:23:17\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Actually, in  this society, you find everything here in this society.\r\n                            1:23:25\r\n                            Any other questions? Pari. Parivash: (unintelligible) legally because many people here, they leave, when they wanna leave, they say, they suddenly leave because they don't wanna be legally and that's...\r\n                            1:23:45\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: It's only okay if  they decide that they are together forever and that they will raise a family, the children and  everything, as a couple forever. The intention  \r\n                            1:23:55\r\n                            must be forever. They may break up next month  or next year, but if the intention was they're  \r\n                            1:24:01\r\n                            getting together forever, then it's okay. It is  not okay to get together with the intention that if things don't work out, goodbye.\r\n                            1:24:12\r\n                            Parivash: Because most of them, they don't wanna have that responsibility. Dr. Khalifa: Right. Parivash: If wanna live and baby, they can have a baby. But I think they don't want that they have responsibility.\r\n                            1:24:29\r\n                            And maybe they live  for 50 years or more than that. Years.\r\n                            1:24:34\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Like I said, if the intention was that they live together forever, then it's perfectly alright. Yeah. Right. Some  \r\n                            1:24:39\r\n                            A woman: Some people get married (unintelligible) and they don't wanna (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Yeah. Right.\r\n                            1:24:46\r\n                            Edip: People's intention. Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, some people get married and one or both have  intention of not being together forever.  \r\n                            1:24:53\r\n                            That's prostitution. Yeah, the Quran consistently  talks about marriage and making it official and  \r\n                            1:25:03\r\n                            everything. Yes, but I'm talking about generally,  in this country, for people who never saw the   Quran, never came across the Quran. Dr. Sabahi: Ok, that's what I wanna...\r\n                            1:25:09\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Marriage is a very organized institution, according to the Quran, because God tells exactly who we can  marry and who we cannot marry. And it's an elaborate  \r\n                            1:25:21\r\n                            and divine institution that is very organized, yes. I'm glad you point this out. Dr. Sabahi: Yeah, I got the wrong...\r\n                            1:25:27\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Against the Quran. Dr. Sabahi: Which is something that I wanted... Dr. Khalifa: We're going against the Quran. The true believer is the hardest working person and the  \r\n                            1:25:35\r\n                            best producer in his job or her job, wherever they  go. And they enjoy every minute of it. Believers  \r\n                            1:25:45\r\n                            are very hard workers and the most honest workers.  And they are the best producers. And they enjoy  \r\n                            1:25:54\r\n                            every second of it. They're not lazy. God doesn't  want the lazies. He wants people on the ball in  \r\n                            1:26:04\r\n                            His kingdom. It was very good. Sura 16 says \"the  rich believer is better than the poor believer.\"\r\n                            1:26:12\r\n                            And Edip wanted me to change this for possible  misunderstandings. But I did not, because God  \r\n                            1:26:19\r\n                            meant that. It says \"the rich believer and the poor  believer, both are believers.\" Both are equally  \r\n                            1:26:26\r\n                            believing. But one of them is able to do things,  is able to give to charity, and able to further  \r\n                            1:26:33\r\n                            the cause of God and spread the word of God and  do things that will make a difference. So, this is a motivation.\r\n                            1:26:42\r\n                            A man: Is it also (unintelligible) Edip: Allah. Dr. Khalifa: Yes, there are authorized printings  and they are the closest to the truth. They have\r\n                            1:26:54\r\n                            one of the mistakes in them. There are three mistakes in them, in the authorized versions of the Quran printed in  \r\n                            1:27:00\r\n                            Saudi Arabia or Egypt. Avoid the ones printed in Iran. They misspelled them and messed them up. You  \r\n                            1:27:09\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: Even the verses, the numbering of the verses? Dr. Khalifa: That's possible, but I know that they \"simplified\"\r\n                            1:27:18\r\n                            the Quranic Arabic and they wrote it in the modern... Edip: In Turkey also. Dr. Khalifa: Also in Turkey?  \r\n                            1:27:24\r\n                            Edip: Yes, misspelled. Dr. Khalifa: uh-oh. Yeah. Dr. Khalifa: The first Quran ever in history  that is the way God wanted it to be printed.\r\n                            1:27:34\r\n                            From here, come out of here the next few weeks, IN SHAA ALLAH.\r\n                            1:27:41\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Farhad? Farhad: You mentioned about Persian translation. Another, another translation, its introduction in Persian language. Another translation is in  \r\n                            1:27:57\r\n                            Arabic. Translating into Persian is convenient  because they use it a lot. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.  \r\n                            1:28:10\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Well, I have good news for you. There is a Farsi translation being done now from my translation. So, we should  \r\n                            1:28:17\r\n                            have it in a year or so, IN SHAA ALLAH. We have  authorized Farsi translation. No. Susan Ray? No. It's done by  \r\n                            1:28:30\r\n                            Behrooz. You meet Behrooz? Behrooz Mofidi Shirazi.  He's doing this. He's going very fast. A man: Mã Shã Allãh.\r\n                            1:28:39\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Martha, did you say something?\r\n                            1:28:57\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: You are not reading your Muslim Perspective (unintelligible). You are not reading your Muslim Perspective.\r\n                            1:29:04\r\n                            Martha: Maybe. Dr. Khalifa: Not maybe. You are not reading your Muslim Perspective. It's right there. It's the answer to your question.  Yes. It's perfect answer to your question in detail. So, go  \r\n                            1:29:17\r\n                            read it. Now. Any other questions? While Martha is  reading the answer to her question.\r\n                            1:29:28\r\n                            Can you, can you what?  What was, what did she say now?\r\n                            1:29:34\r\n                            A woman: Me? I said, any other questions  that Rashad can avoid tonight by telling us to read them.\r\n                            1:29:40\r\n                            A woman: (unintelligible). That's actually very efficient, especially since it's five o'clock at night. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            1:29:51\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: It only takes a  minute, but it answers your question perfectly.   The answer is \"yes.\" The Prophet Muhammad was given  specific instructions. Every time Gabriel released  \r\n                            1:30:00\r\n                            Quran from Muhammad's soul to Muhammad's memory,  he gave him instructions as to where these three  \r\n                            1:30:06\r\n                            or four verses belong. And he wrote down those  verses and he put the instructions next to them.  \r\n                            1:30:14\r\n                            So, when he died, he left the complete Quran,  but not in the order that God wanted for the  \r\n                            1:30:19\r\n                            world. He left the Quran with instructions on  the side as to which Sura goes after what Sura  \r\n                            1:30:25\r\n                            and which verse goes after which verse. Martha: (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:30:32\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Exactly. They followed  the instructions. They put the Quran together, but   then Satan tricked them into adding two verses.  And that was during Uthman's time. And this  \r\n                            1:30:43\r\n                            triggered the war between Ali and his family  and the Umayyads. Martha: If that's the thing that you're referring to, I read that part. The part about Ali and his family. I've read that part. Dr. Khalifa: Right.\r\n                            1:30:57\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: There were 50 years of   bitter war, but unfortunately, the Umayyads won.  So, we got their version. We didn't get the version of the believers.\r\n                            1:31:09\r\n                            A woman: Did Gabriel come down from the sky to Prophet Muhammad? Dr. Khalifa: No.\r\n                            1:31:18\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: He was an angel. No, he didn't see him   A woman: Did he saw him? Dr. Khalifa: No, he didn't see him as an angel.\r\n                            1:31:27\r\n                            A woman: Did he just dream him? Dr. Khalifa: No, no, no, he didn't dream. Gabriel  comes and takes and becomes part of Muhammad's  \r\n                            1:31:35\r\n                            body and releases the... Gabriel built a  connection between Muhammad's soul and Muhammad's  \r\n                            1:31:41\r\n                            physical body. He didn't need to see him.\r\n                            1:31:46\r\n                            A woman: So, I mean like did he talk to them? Dr. Khalifa: No, not like that. When... the possession, you lose... In the possession, you lose your \r\n                            1:31:54\r\n                            identity completely. If you are possessed by an  angel or a demon or whatever, Naghmeh disappears  \r\n                            1:32:01\r\n                            and the other entity takes over completely. And  you have no consciousness at all. But Muhammad was\r\n                            1:32:07\r\n                            fully conscious. He just had these words come to  him and he would write down the verses. It comes  \r\n                            1:32:13\r\n                            to his memory. It's just like you're remembering  something. You remember that you took a final   exam three days ago, and the questions were this,  this, and this, and you can write them down. So,\r\n                            1:32:23\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: this is how he received it. A woman: But he knew that all  along it was a spiritual thing. Dr. Khalifa: Oh, yeah.\r\n                            1:32:31\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Ok. Well, whatever your dearest wish is, turn to God  and ask him for it. The best wish being to stay  \r\n                            1:32:38\r\n                            on the right path. Al-Fãtehah.

Then after the Khutbah, Lydia came to me and said \"do you know you're giving the Quranic study?\"\r\n                            0:32\r\n                            And she took the beating on behalf of Lisa. Actually, Lisa sent her to tell me that.\r\n                            0:39\r\n                            So, here I am. First of all, we welcome a new member to our masjid.\r\n                            0:45\r\n                            This person here. I forgot his name.\r\n                            0:54\r\n                            This is the former, and still is, Muhtesem Erisen, the one and only. Mã Shã Allãh Welcome back.\r\n                            Position of the Arms during Salat – does not matter. Direction of Qibla.\r\n                            1:04\r\n                            Before I start, there is also one more point that I wanted to mention.\r\n                            1:09\r\n                            Thanks to our Iranian brothers and sisters. There is a little bit of confusion now about your arms, what to do with your arms when you pray.\r\n                            1:17\r\n                            Keep them like this and put them straight down. I would like to establish first, once and for all, that it doesn't make any difference,\r\n                            1:25\r\n                            whether you go like this or put your hands down. But generally, what I do is I follow what the Imam is doing.\r\n                            1:34\r\n                            The person in the front, whatever the person in front is doing, I do what he's doing. And I recommend that for you.\r\n                            1:47\r\n                            IN SHAA ALLAH, we'll be doing Sura 90, The Town.\r\n                            1:52\r\n                            And whatever we can afterwards. At 8:30, the children will practice on us.\r\n                            1:59\r\n                            You know, they'll be singing at the conference. So, we'll give them maybe 20 minutes, 20 minutes to 9.\r\n                            2:06\r\n                            20 minutes enough? 20 minutes to practice a new song on us.\r\n                            2:12\r\n                            It should be enjoyable, IN SHAA ALLAH.\r\n                            2:17\r\n                            Sura 90, The Town. In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.\r\n                            2:23\r\n                            [90:1] I solemnly swear by this town. [90:2] The town where you live.\r\n                            2:31\r\n                            [90:3] The begetting and the begotten. [90:4] We created the human being to work hard (to redeem himself).*\r\n                            2:39\r\n                            [90:5] Does he think that no one will ever call him to account? [90:6] He boasts, \"I spent so much money!\"\r\n                            2:46\r\n                            [90:7] Does he think that no one sees him? [90:8] Did we not give him two eyes?\r\n                            2:53\r\n                            [90:9] A tongue and two lips? Number 10, [90:10] Did we not show him the two paths?\r\n                            3:00\r\n                            [90:11] He should choose the difficult path. [90:12] Which one is the difficult path?\r\n                            3:06\r\n                            [90:13] The freeing of slaves. [90:14] Feeding, during the time of hardship.\r\n                            3:11\r\n                            [90:15] Orphans who are related. [90:16] Or the poor who is in need. [90:17] And being one of those who believe, and exhorting one another to be steadfast, and exhorting one another to be kind.\r\n                            3:24\r\n                            [90:18] These have deserved happiness. [90:19] As for those who disbelieved in our revelations, they have incurred misery.\r\n                            3:31\r\n                            [90:20] They will be confined in the Hellfire. So, that's the whole Sura.\r\n                            3:38\r\n                            I go back to the beginning, swearing. God usually starts many of these short Suras with a profound statement.\r\n                            3:48\r\n                            And this town, meaning Mecca, is profound. Because God made it sacred by putting His shrine there\r\n                            3:56\r\n                            to serve as the focal point. or a point of organization for all believers around the world.\r\n                            4:02\r\n                            When we stand in Prayer, we don't fight as to which direction we should face.\r\n                            4:08\r\n                            God already decided for us that we're gonna face the direction of Mecca. So, every believer, every Muslim around the world is praying and facing that point.\r\n                            4:22\r\n                            So, the first verse is simply a profound statement, as in many other Suras.\r\n                            4:28\r\n                            And it is the town where the Prophet Muhammad lived from whom this Quran was revealed.\r\n                            4:35\r\n                            \"The begetting and the begotten\" is a profound statement again. All these profound statements precede an important proclamation.\r\n                            4:45\r\n                            The begetting and the begotten, this is a profound fact of life.\r\n                            4:54\r\n                            Take for example birds. The bird laying an egg.\r\n                            4:59\r\n                            The egg has been fertilized by two parents, through two parents.\r\n                            5:04\r\n                            One half, a reproductive cell is half a normal cell. One reproductive cell from the male and one half, the other half comes from the female.\r\n                            5:15\r\n                            They combine to form an embryo. In birds, the egg is laid, it is fertilized.\r\n                            5:21\r\n                            And then, the fact that the birds sit on the eggs, you know they take turns, the male and female in most species.\r\n                            5:32\r\n                            Taking turns sitting on the egg. Why do they do that? Who taught them to do that?\r\n                            5:39\r\n                            And what's happening inside that shell, the egg?\r\n                            5:45\r\n                            After a period of time, that it is becoming obvious more and more that it's a multiple of 7. 21 days in some birds.\r\n                            5:56\r\n                            21, 7 times 3. The human fetus now is in the mother's womb 266 days.\r\n                            6:04\r\n                            It is now established scientifically. 266, not 265. 266 and that's 19 times 2 times 7.\r\n                            6:12\r\n                            That's still a multiple of 7.\r\n                            6:18\r\n                            Gestation period, is it called the gestation period? Is that the period inside the womb?\r\n                            6:24\r\n                            Ok. In many other species, I know it is a multiple of 7, but I'm being distracted now.\r\n                            6:30\r\n                            However, \"the begetting and the begotten\" is a profound statement.\r\n                            6:35\r\n                            After 21 days, the bird inside breaks through the shell and comes out.\r\n                            6:43\r\n                            Then, they're walking around. If they're ducks, they go in the water and they swim. You know, as if they've been here forever.\r\n                            6:48\r\n                            As if they know everything. Walking around, following their mother in the water.\r\n                            6:54\r\n                            You can go to a random spot and see them. They just came out of the egg. And they're full of wisdom, you know, just following the mother wherever she goes. And sometimes they go independently and pick at something in the water.\r\n                            “Created the human being to work hard to redeem himself” explained.\r\n                            7:06\r\n                            And they're identical to their parents. With beaks and eyes. Where did this come from?\r\n                            7:15\r\n                            And you can do this with any kind of species, any begetting and begotten.\r\n                            7:22\r\n                            Now here comes the proclamation. Number 4. [90:4] We created the human being to work hard (to redeem himself).*\r\n                            7:31\r\n                            As a result of that crime that we committed millions of years ago,\r\n                            7:36\r\n                            where we did not make a firm stand with God's absolute authority, we are here.\r\n                            7:43\r\n                            And God designed our plan to work hard, to redeem ourselves, to denounce that crime,\r\n                            7:50\r\n                            to prove that we are on the side of God's absolute authority.\r\n                            8:00\r\n                            What do you call getting up in the morning before sunrise? It's not easy, is it? At the beginning, especially when our soul is still small and weak.\r\n                            8:08\r\n                            The soul cannot wake up the body initially. Because the soul is weak.\r\n                            8:15\r\n                            It is hard work. And you are rewarded by growth, nutrition, and strength of the soul.\r\n                            8:28\r\n                            [90:4] We created the human being to work hard..... The lazy person who does not work hard and does not get up before sunrise, what is the result?\r\n                            8:39\r\n                            He or she ends up with a shrunken, weak soul that will not amount to anything in the real life, the Eternity.\r\n                            8:50\r\n                            They will be born into Eternity deformed.\r\n                            8:56\r\n                            And we see this in Sura 68 where they cannot fall prostrate.\r\n                            Dr. Rashad Khalifa Explains Initially difficult to do all prayers especially for the young. Missing prayers.\r\n                            9:01\r\n                            On that big day when God comes physically to our universe, they will not be able to, they have no legs.\r\n                            9:08\r\n                            I mean, this is symbolically. They are deformed. A stump cannot fall prostrate.\r\n                            9:15\r\n                            They are deformed. It is lack of growth.\r\n                            9:20\r\n                            To get up in the morning before sunrise and do the Morning Prayer is a gift from God. If we deserve it, God will guide us into waking up before sunrise to do the Morning Prayer.\r\n                            9:34\r\n                            For the young people, I don't want you to be alarmed because it may be difficult for you, but eventually\r\n                            9:41\r\n                            you will be able to train your body to get up in the morning before sunrise. If you are unable to do it now, don't be too disturbed.\r\n                            9:51\r\n                            It is normal. Let me tell you this because I don't wanna be too hard on you. It is normal to start out by doing one prayer a day.\r\n                            9:59\r\n                            Let us say the Morning Prayer as soon as you get up at 10 or 11 in the morning.\r\n                            10:04\r\n                            Then, it will be two prayers a day. Then, it will be three prayers a day.\r\n                            10:10\r\n                            Then, you will do the Morning Prayer before sunrise and you will enjoy it.\r\n                            10:16\r\n                            The ideal situation is to do the five Prayers with the Morning Prayer done before sunrise.\r\n                            10:24\r\n                            Also, God tells us in the Quran that we cannot do it every day. You're gonna miss once in a while.\r\n                            10:31\r\n                            So, always think of the positive and be glad, be happy with the achievements that you do.\r\n                            10:37\r\n                            If you miss one time a week or something, don't feel too guilty. Be glad that you did six out of the seven days, Morning Prayers before sunrise.\r\n                            10:48\r\n                            Ideally, you will not miss anything. You will do the Morning before sunrise and you will do the other four Prayers as well.\r\n                            10:54\r\n                            [90:4] We created the human being to work hard (to redeem himself).*\r\n                            10:59\r\n                            There's a footnote here that says \"see the Introduction and Appendix 7 for the purpose behind our creation.\r\n                            11:05\r\n                            Redeem ourselves. Go back to God's kingdom where we were. We got ourselves out by being interested in Satan's theory that others besides God can have power.\r\n                            11:22\r\n                            And the people are doing the same mistake now. They think Jesus can have power, or Mary, or Saint Jude, or Muhammad, or Ali, or Hussein, or Mahdi, or whatever.\r\n                            11:33\r\n                            People are repeating the same mistake. We did. God saved us.\r\n                            11:39\r\n                            This is how we get redeemed. By upholding the words of God alone and worshipping God alone.\r\n                            11:50\r\n                            Number five talks about those who fail to redeem themselves. [90:5] Does he think that no one will ever call him to account?\r\n                            11:58\r\n                            See, everything we do here is credited to us or held against us, whatever we do here.\r\n                            Dr. Rashad Khalifa explains Original sin. Idol worshippers repeating what they did in the high society. “Prayers take a back seat” for some “Muslim”.\r\n                            12:09\r\n                            And anything is forgivable except idol worship\r\n                            12:15\r\n                            if maintained until death. That's the unforgivable crime, because this is why we are here.\r\n                            12:24\r\n                            We are here for just one reason, to establish the fact that we know that only God possesses all power.\r\n                            12:31\r\n                            And so number five is telling us that every one of us will be called to account.\r\n                            12:39\r\n                            With the majority of people, they'll be asked \"why didn't you develop your soul? How come you fed your body three meals a day, but you failed to feed yourself, your soul?\"\r\n                            12:51\r\n                            Most people go through their whole life without feeding the real person a single meal.\r\n                            13:00\r\n                            This is repeated in the Quran. Most people, no matter what you do, will not believe.\r\n                            13:05\r\n                            And most of those who believe will fall into idolatry, into idol worship.\r\n                            13:12\r\n                            And we see this everywhere, don't we? Just think of any mosque in the world that says the Adhan, for example, the call to prayer, devoted to God alone,\r\n                            13:21\r\n                            without the name of Muhammad or Ali or somebody besides God.\r\n                            13:28\r\n                            In all of Iran or Pakistan or Egypt or Saudi Arabia, there isn't a single one mosque\r\n                            13:33\r\n                            that is devoted to God alone, which goes against the commandments of the Quran.\r\n                            13:39\r\n                            What happened to their brains? They're just repeating what they did in the High Society.\r\n                            13:52\r\n                            [90:5] Does he think that no one will ever call him to account? [90:6] He boasts, \"I spent so much money!\"\r\n                            13:58\r\n                            Isn't this what most people do? They're preoccupied with the almighty dollar.\r\n                            14:10\r\n                            In the meeting with our brothers and sisters in New York, I was asking them \"when you get up in the morning, what is your list of priorities?\"\r\n                            14:19\r\n                            \"Are you going to have three meals today?\"\r\n                            14:24\r\n                            Just when you open your eyes in the morning, ask yourself these questions. \"What am I gonna do today? I'm gonna have three meals today?\"\r\n                            14:31\r\n                            That's about 30 minutes, at least. \"Am I going to the bathroom today?\"\r\n                            14:37\r\n                            Two or three times. \"Am I going to work today?\"\r\n                            14:43\r\n                            Four to eight hours. \"Am I going to exercise today?\"\r\n                            14:48\r\n                            Thirty to sixty minutes. \"What else will I do? Will I watch the TV today for one or two hours?\"\r\n                            14:56\r\n                            \"Will I give God twenty-five minutes? Will I do my five Prayers today?\"\r\n                            15:02\r\n                            Even with some Muslims, the five Prayers take a back seat to everything else.\r\n                            15:09\r\n                            You ask them \"why don't you come to the Friday prayer?\" \"Why don't you do the five Prayers?\"\r\n                            15:15\r\n                            They will say \"I had an appointment here and there, and I did this and that, and there was no time for the Prayer.\"\r\n                            15:25\r\n                            But we thank God because all of us here, we work our schedules around the Prayers, the five Prayers.\r\n                            15:31\r\n                            That's the proper thing to do. It should be that when we get up in the morning, on top of the list will be the five Prayers, at least.\r\n                            15:42\r\n                            On top of the list. Then, if there is time for anything else, we will do that.\r\n                            15:48\r\n                            This is why the verse that says \"most of those who believe, fall in idol worship.\"\r\n                            15:54\r\n                            Because when you give priority to anything else, that's your idol. Now, don't get me wrong. There are situations where you are forced by circumstances to miss\r\n                            16:04\r\n                            a Prayer or two, or a Friday, an occasional Friday. And I don't want you to feel guilty about that either.\r\n                            16:10\r\n                            Because God Himself in the Quran gives you, knows what's in your heart, and gives you excuses.\r\n                            16:16\r\n                            But generally in your life, you're giving priority to God and your duties towards God,\r\n                            16:21\r\n                            which are actually a gift from God to you. So, when you get up in the morning, you think, I'm gonna have three meals today.\r\n                            16:29\r\n                            I'm gonna give my body at least a half hour for eating.\r\n                            16:34\r\n                            Eating, drinking, snacking, more. You're really taking care of your body.\r\n                            16:40\r\n                            How about your soul? The believers have their priorities in the right order.\r\n                            16:48\r\n                            When I open up my eyes in the morning, the five Prayers, this will take precedence over everything else.\r\n                            16:59\r\n                            Number six, [90:6] He boasts, \"I spent so much money!\" Because they're devoted to that. Money is the god of most people, unfortunately.\r\n                            17:11\r\n                            If the boss says \"you're gonna come tomorrow at three o'clock in the morning\", they will set the alarm at two o'clock.\r\n                            17:18\r\n                            They will get up at two o'clock, very energetic, put on their clothes and go\r\n                            17:23\r\n                            to that field trip at three o'clock in the morning. Yet, their job or their boss does not give them that money. It is God who is giving them the money.\r\n                            17:39\r\n                            I want to share with you an important verse, so I go get my index. Speaking of money, in verse six, it's a very important verse that we should all be very familiar with.\r\n                            17:55\r\n                            I think it is in Sura 29, I'm not sure, but I will give you the correct Sura and verse right now.\r\n                            18:15\r\n                            Yeah, it is Sura 29, verse 17.\r\n                            18:23\r\n                            Let me have the whole Quran. Lydia, are you gonna read it for us? Dr. Khalifa: 29:17.\r\n                            18:30\r\n                            Lydia: [29:17] \"What you idolize besides GOD are idols from your creation; you.\" Whatever idols you set up possess no provisions for you. Therefore, seek provisions only from GOD. Worship Him alone, and be appreciative of Him; to Him will be your return.\r\n                            18:44\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: It's a very important verse you must all remember, 29:17. It says \"the idols you set up besides God\", and it appears here that specifically the\r\n                            18:53\r\n                            money idol, the almighty dollar, do not possess the power to provide for you.\r\n                            18:58\r\n                            Therefore, seek provisions from God, because God is the Only Provider.\r\n                            God assigned the “dollars” (Money) in your life. We are being “video recorded” explained. Believers know no virus can attack you – tests may permit this, health restored.\r\n                            19:04\r\n                            And as believers we know that. We must believe that. No one else is the provider.\r\n                            19:10\r\n                            Many of you have gone through this experience and they know that the people who interview you and give you jobs and so on, they have no power whatsoever.\r\n                            19:19\r\n                            God is the One who's running them.\r\n                            19:25\r\n                            This is why verse 7, verse 6 illustrates the stupidity of most humans.\r\n                            19:31\r\n                            [90:6] He boasts, \"I spent so much money!\" Or I made so much money, you know, same thing.\r\n                            19:38\r\n                            The dollars assigned to you have been already assigned to you by God before you were born.\r\n                            19:46\r\n                            And I know the argument. You say \"you mean I'm gonna sit down and money will come to me?\" \"Yes, you'll sit down and money will come to you.\"\r\n                            19:59\r\n                            I mean, God will see to it, as a believer you will work and you will make money. God will provide for you through the right and proper way.\r\n                            20:08\r\n                            Because if you sit and do nothing, after 4 or 5 hours you're going to be hungry, you have to eat. So, how will you eat?\r\n                            20:14\r\n                            You will go look for, dig a ditch or something to make some money to eat. So, you will work, and God will provide you through that.\r\n                            20:21\r\n                            So, there is a system, a divine system that we know.\r\n                            20:26\r\n                            Number 7, another question, [90:7] Does he think that no one sees him?\r\n                            20:35\r\n                            In other words, everything is recorded. Just think that there is a video camera going with you wherever you go.\r\n                            20:42\r\n                            And you're gonna find that video tape hanging in your neck on the Day of Judgment.\r\n                            20:51\r\n                            That will keep you on your toes.\r\n                            20:57\r\n                            Ironically, the believers do this automatically, they don't... They know God is with them the whole time, and they know there are video specialists\r\n                            21:09\r\n                            with the most sophisticated video cameras. I mean, the cameras themselves are invisible, but they take 3 dimensional pictures.\r\n                            21:19\r\n                            It's the most sophisticated video tape, and you're gonna have it hanging in your neck on the Day of Judgment.\r\n                            21:26\r\n                            As a believer, you have the privilege of editing it. You're gonna have a perfect tape.\r\n                            21:36\r\n                            [90:7] Does he think that no one sees him? What is the implication here?\r\n                            21:44\r\n                            The believers are aware of the invisible forces and God's invisible soldiers.\r\n                            21:50\r\n                            This is what the believers, when God tells them, they're guaranteed perfect life, perfect protection.\r\n                            22:00\r\n                            They know they're perfectly protected by God. No virus can attack you. You're protected.\r\n                            22:11\r\n                            You may go through some tests. You may be allowed to be invaded by viruses or bacteria or\r\n                            22:18\r\n                            headaches or whatever as a test, but you will be restored.\r\n                            22:23\r\n                            You know you'll be restored. We're all aware of the tests, and all the tests for the believers are restorable.\r\n                            22:33\r\n                            Not the tests themselves, the believer is restorable. Whatever happens, there are things that can be erased completely, but you are fully protected.\r\n                            22:45\r\n                            Number eight tells us, [90:8] Did we not give him two eyes?\r\n                            22:52\r\n                            I'm looking for somebody who recorded that discovery program about the eyes.\r\n                            22:58\r\n                            That should make a believer of anybody, that program.\r\n                            23:05\r\n                            I don't know if anybody recorded it. I think I asked Phil Traverse to record it for me, and chances are he did when I was away.\r\n                            23:16\r\n                            In that case, I will share it together on one of those Fridays. But I don't need to tell you how incredible the eye is.\r\n                            23:27\r\n                            Just the muscles that focus the lens of your eye immediately.\r\n                            23:32\r\n                            I mean, how fast does your eye move from this to this? It focuses immediately.\r\n                            23:40\r\n                            I look at the paper and I'm focused. Excuse me, I have to put my glasses on.\r\n                            23:47\r\n                            My eye focuses with the glasses and I can see the reading here. Then, I look at Edip and it focuses on Edip. It's not out of focus.\r\n                            23:54\r\n                            In a fraction of a second. The muscles, if you look in the mirror, you can see your muscles working.\r\n                            23:59\r\n                            Does anybody do that? Does anybody do that? You look in the mirror and you turn the light on to catch your pupil as it goes like this.\r\n                            Dr. Rashad Khalifa talks about the “incredible” tongue (Banter). Talks about mosquito incident (banter)\r\n                            24:10\r\n                            How many people... I did that. Those who laughed, they know it. They know what I mean.\r\n                            24:17\r\n                            I must have been ten years old or something and I went to the mirror with a flashlight to look in there.\r\n                            24:25\r\n                            Right. And then I surprised my eye and turned the light on and I could see the pupil goes like this.\r\n                            24:32\r\n                            These are muscles that work. [90:8] Did we not give him two eyes? [90:9] A tongue and two lips?\r\n                            24:40\r\n                            That was Mahmoud's last Khutba. That tongue is an incredible thing.\r\n                            24:47\r\n                            We cannot eat without it, actually. Because it keeps the food under the grinders, those things, your teeth.\r\n                            24:55\r\n                            The tongue pushes it. You confuse the tongue sometimes if you eat on both sides. Then, you bite your tongue.\r\n                            25:05\r\n                            If you're greedy and you don't follow the Quran and the food is too good.\r\n                            25:10\r\n                            God said \"eat and drink but not extravagantly.\"\r\n                            25:16\r\n                            You can confuse your own tongue if you eat on both sides at the same time. Then, the tongue doesn't know where to push and you end up biting your tongue.\r\n                            25:24\r\n                            But it's an incredible... that tongue is an incredible thing. You cannot talk without it, either.\r\n                            25:33\r\n                            Just try to say anything and be conscious of the movements of your tongue.\r\n                            25:38\r\n                            Up and down and to the side as you talk.\r\n                            25:45\r\n                            Everybody wants to say something, right? Just say the word \"talk\" and you can see where your tongue moves from up.\r\n                            25:53\r\n                            Because the T, when you say T, your tongue is up. \"Talk\", your tongue goes down.\r\n                            26:00\r\n                            You cannot talk without your tongue. Even the language is called tongue sometimes.\r\n                            26:06\r\n                            What a design! So, God is telling us about His greatness which is incomprehensible.\r\n                            26:15\r\n                            God's greatness is immense. It's not just controlling your tongue, but also the mosquito that's flying in the air.\r\n                            26:23\r\n                            The heart of that mosquito is being controlled by God. The amount of nutrition that is assigned to that mosquito, which includes some of your blood\r\n                            26:34\r\n                            is also recorded. And it is computerized to coincide with something wrong you did.\r\n                            26:46\r\n                            Then, you get a bite. Or to give you some entertainment, like on our way to San Francisco for example, and\r\n                            26:53\r\n                            we went to pray in a rest area. Boy, did we beat ourselves.\r\n                            27:00\r\n                            That was the fastest Prayer we ever did. There were five billion hungry mosquitoes waiting for us.\r\n                            27:08\r\n                            And they were so sly. You know, they waited until we said \"Allahu Akbar.\"\r\n                            27:21\r\n                            That was really something. I think God wanted to give us more rewards, but no really, that was struggling, striving in the cause of God.\r\n                            27:34\r\n                            And we wondered why the rest area was so empty, you know.\r\n                            27:40\r\n                            We said \"wow, this is reserved for us.\" Now, we know.\r\n                            27:49\r\n                            So, God controls the provisions for not just your, controls the heart, not just your heart, or the heart of billions of people,\r\n                            27:57\r\n                            the heart of every creature on earth.\r\n                            “Did we not show him the two paths”. Choosing the difficult path. “Break the initially barrier” to enjoy guidance. “Waking for Salat without an alarm. Anonymous charity.\r\n                            28:04\r\n                            Number ten is a great blessing, a great blessing. [90:10] Did we not show him the two paths?\r\n                            28:12\r\n                            Right and wrong. We come to this world perfectly unaware of the incidents in the High Society.\r\n                            28:20\r\n                            We start out clean in this world. And then, we receive two messages. A message of God alone, a message from God.\r\n                            28:28\r\n                            And a message of God and somebody else from Satan. That's it. There is no other path.\r\n                            28:35\r\n                            The path of worshiping God alone. And you remember the statement in the Bible, that path is very narrow and straightened.\r\n                            28:41\r\n                            straightened and what? Difficult? Just look how much persecution we're subjected to.\r\n                            28:50\r\n                            Which is a blessing because you get rewarded for it. And the other path is wide?\r\n                            28:55\r\n                            Look at all the cathedrals in the world. The Crystal Cathedral in Anaheim.\r\n                            29:01\r\n                            They all belong to Satan. All the big mosques and the big cathedrals.\r\n                            29:10\r\n                            The wrong path is wide and conforming with the crowd.\r\n                            29:15\r\n                            Look how many people meet the Pope.\r\n                            29:23\r\n                            One of you, one of the most important people on earth, would go to Los Angeles, nobody will even know.\r\n                            29:30\r\n                            When the Pope goes to Los Angeles, there's security and arrangements and a Pop Mobile and all kinds of things.\r\n                            29:40\r\n                            But when you go to Los Angeles, nobody hears about it. Yet you're a very very important person.\r\n                            29:49\r\n                            Such is this world, Satan's kingdom.\r\n                            29:56\r\n                            [90:10] Did we not show him the two paths? And here's God's recommendation on number 11.\r\n                            30:01\r\n                            [90:11] He should choose the difficult path. Because this is how you train your wild horse, your body.\r\n                            30:10\r\n                            God is recommending that we choose the difficult path. Again, we talk about getting up in the morning before sunrise.\r\n                            30:19\r\n                            It's not really so difficult, I don't know. But...\r\n                            30:42\r\n                            Yes, Sura 65. A man: If you look at from outside, once you accept it, God makes it easy.\r\n                            30:51\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Exactly. God makes it easy and enjoyable. But you see, you have to break that initial barrier.\r\n                            31:02\r\n                            It is enjoyable. I'm theorizing that our companion enjoys it too.\r\n                            31:11\r\n                            Because I don't set the alarm anymore and I suspect this is true with most of you.\r\n                            31:17\r\n                            I just don't set the alarm and in the last few weeks, I traveled into different time zones,\r\n                            31:23\r\n                            Central and Eastern and all this. And it doesn't matter where I am. Before sunrise, something wakes me up.\r\n                            31:29\r\n                            And I suspect it is the companion. So, he must enjoy it. Thank God.\r\n                            31:36\r\n                            Maybe an angel. I don't know. But there comes a time when you don't need, you don't need an alarm.\r\n                            31:46\r\n                            You don't need anything to make you get up and enjoy it. So, God does make it easy.\r\n                            31:53\r\n                            Sura 65, God says \"those who observe God's commandments, God makes things easy for them.\"\r\n                            31:58\r\n                            This applies to everything though, everything in life. And this will include the gift from God of doing the Five Prayers, the Zakat, the Zakat Charity.\r\n                            32:15\r\n                            It's not a popular thing, taking money from your pocket to give it away.\r\n                            32:24\r\n                            I came back from a two week absence and they opened this drawer. And there were Zakat envelopes from anonymous people, you.\r\n                            32:33\r\n                            You know, these are people who really believe in God, because where do they get the credit? Because they believe in God.\r\n                            32:43\r\n                            I say to Lisa \"whose handwriting is this?\"\r\n                            32:49\r\n                            I haven't cracked that yet, but I know that they are people that God loves.\r\n                            32:59\r\n                            He should choose the difficult path.\r\n                            33:07\r\n                            God's commandments. Taming the wild horse.\r\n                            33:12\r\n                            You know, Discipline. When we are praying, this is discipline.\r\n                            33:18\r\n                            Did you see Amir praying? Actually standing still for about five minutes. I mean, that's a miracle.\r\n                            33:27\r\n                            And he's rewarded generously for that. This is discipline. I mean, at his age, I'd be running around all over the place, jumping up and down.\r\n                            33:36\r\n                            But to be standing still like this, bowing and prostrating before God, it's a tremendous blessing.\r\n                            33:42\r\n                            And a lot of discipline. This is what God means here. Why he should choose the difficult path.\r\n                            33:51\r\n                            Number twelve. A definition of the difficult path. [90:12] Which one is the difficult path?\r\n                            33:57\r\n                            And we have examples of it. [90:13] The freeing of slaves. In the past, what was the civil war all about?\r\n                            Freeing the slave. Traits of the believers. Happiness now and forever.\r\n                            34:05\r\n                            Anybody enlighten me with Civil war? The historians? Lydia? Put down the tab and tell me.\r\n                            34:12\r\n                            What is the civil war all about? Lincoln? Was it in Lincoln's time? Does it have anything to do with freeing the slaves?\r\n                            34:18\r\n                            Lydia: A little, yeah. Dr. Khalifa: What was it all about? The North was fighting the South. Lydia: (unintelligible) Social problems. But there was also (unintelligible) freeing the slaves was the basic underlying issue here.\r\n                            34:32\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Ok. Why was it an issue? The North was fighting the South, right? What is...\r\n                            34:38\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible) The Southern economy is powerful.\r\n                            34:43\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Oh, Ok. The South resisted. A man: So, the idea that the North got involved in the Civil War to freeing slaves is a pretty (unintelligible) idea. They got involved in the war to destroy the economy of the South. (unintelligible).\r\n                            35:00\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Okay, Matt? Matt: (unintelligible) very economy of the North. (unintelligible)\r\n                            35:05\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Hey, Rashada, hey, hey, hey, kid. Matt: The North (unintelligible)\r\n                            35:14\r\n                            Southern economy (unintelligible). The Southern economy (unintelligible)\r\n                            35:21\r\n                            So, actually, the freeing of slaves was a big issue for 50 years before the war started.\r\n                            35:26\r\n                            But it was mostly for religious purposes and other stuff. It was a side issue.\r\n                            35:33\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: So, part of it was that the South was resisting the law to free the slaves. Matt: They wanted to protect the social (unintelligible).\r\n                            35:38\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: They did not want to free the slaves. Dr. Khalifa: Whatever the reasons, they did not want to do it.\r\n                            35:45\r\n                            And therefore, it is given here as an example of something that the human being does not want to do.\r\n                            35:52\r\n                            Yes, number 13 says, [90:13] The freeing of slaves. is indicated as a difficult job that must be done by believers.\r\n                            36:00\r\n                            A man: In the United States, we still have a system where the vast majority of workers support\r\n                            36:05\r\n                            a very small percentage of people who have a large amount of money. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. A man: So, economically, there's a situation of... Dr. Khalifa: slavery.\r\n                            36:14\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: But it is not the same as the slavery that existed at the time of the revelation of the Quran until a hundred years ago in this country.\r\n                            36:25\r\n                            I mean, you can see, you can actually see traces of it until now. I think the racism that we still see in this country is the tail end of consequences of slavery and so on.\r\n                            36:40\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Number? A man: The idea is that the (unintelligible) should always have a group of people. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            36:48\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: (Unintelligible), yes. A man: It's not limited to one group. It's not limited to blacks.\r\n                            36:54\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: But you can certainly define slavery as exploitation of other humans. And it is indicated by the Quran as a vicious, terrible crime.\r\n                            37:02\r\n                            A man: But I think many people think that slavery is a sin. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            37:13\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Right. Dr. Khalifa: This is why one of the laws of the Quran is \"oppression is worse than murder.\"\r\n                            37:21\r\n                            Oppression is worse than murder. The freeing of slaves, number 14, feeding the hungry.\r\n                            37:28\r\n                            Feeding or charity. Feeding symbolizes being charitable during the time of hardship.\r\n                            37:35\r\n                            [90:15] Orphans who are related. [90:16] Or the poor who is in need. Number 17,\r\n                            37:40\r\n                            [90:17] And being one of those who believe,... It's not easy to believe.\r\n                            37:47\r\n                            Muhteshem can tell you a few things about his encounter with disbelievers in Turkey. Tell us something.\r\n                            37:54\r\n                            What is the majority reaction in Turkey to your ideas of the Quran and worshipping God alone, the Quran alone?\r\n                            38:01\r\n                            What was the reaction? Take a hundred people. Out of a hundred, how many people agreed with you? Muhteshem: None.\r\n                            38:08\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Zero. All right. Were they violently opposed to you? Or were there degrees of violent reaction?\r\n                            38:18\r\n                            Muhteshem: They insulted me literally, looking down on me.\r\n                            38:23\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: They insulted him because he says \"follow the Quran alone.\" Looking down on him, because this is all in the Quran.\r\n                            38:34\r\n                            Yep. We know that Edip, don't we?\r\n                            38:42\r\n                            And it seems to be that \"these Muslims,\" are the ones who are doing this.\r\n                            38:47\r\n                            Christians are not, the atheists are not insulting the believers.\r\n                            38:56\r\n                            So, number 17, being one of those who believe, is not easy.\r\n                            39:04\r\n                            [90:17] .....and exhorting one another to be steadfast, and exhorting one another to be kind.\r\n                            39:11\r\n                            at the same time\r\n                            39:16\r\n                            [90:18] These have deserved happiness. We're not talking about happiness in the Hereafter only. We are talking about happiness now and forever.\r\n                            39:26\r\n                            Happiness now and forever. More and more, God is strengthening these ideas in our minds through real life examples.\r\n                            39:36\r\n                            Our own life, right here in this mosque.\r\n                            39:41\r\n                            Number 18 says, [90:18] These have deserved happiness. See the period there?\r\n                            39:50\r\n                            It means now and forever. Number 19, [90:19] As for those who disbelieved in our revelations, they have incurred misery.\r\n                            40:03\r\n                            Now and forever. [90:20] They will be confined in the Hellfire.\r\n                            40:10\r\n                            So, these short Suras are loaded, as you see.\r\n                            40:15\r\n                            Just one short Sura, 20 verses, and it's loaded with information. Any questions?\r\n                            40:23\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi. Dr. Sabahi: Verse 4 in Arabic, (unintelligible)\r\n                            40:37\r\n                            human beings (unintelligible)\r\n                            40:43\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: To suffer. Dr. Sabahi: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            40:55\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Not necessarily, but you see, KABAD (كَبَدٍ) is effort, work. Dr. Sabahi: Right. Dr. Khalifa: TAKABADA, the verb TAKABADA, in Arabic, means \"exert himself, effort.\r\n                            41:06\r\n                            What does the Farsi say there? Is that a Farsi translation? Or a... Dr. Sabahi: This is a different translation than...\r\n                            41:13\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: English? Dr. Sabahi: No, Farsi. Dr. Khalifa: Oh, Farsi. So, what does it say there? Dr. Sabahi: It says that human beings were created\r\n                            41:25\r\n                            (unintelligible) Not in pain but pain and suffering is part of it.\r\n                            41:31\r\n                            That is the way you're just, you're born. That's how everything was nice and easy for you.\r\n                            41:39\r\n                            But you would never appreciate what you get. So, but it is that you go through this pain and suffering and then you learn and then you appreciate it.\r\n                            41:49\r\n                            The good thing is that then you would be on the right path. And you appreciate more and you go to the right path\r\n                            41:56\r\n                            So, you've created this pain, and you keep working hard to finding it in all these problems.\r\n                            42:01\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: That's a typical interpretation of non-believers, actually.\r\n                            42:10\r\n                            Satan is trying to justify the pain and misery that his clients go through.\r\n                            42:16\r\n                            It is not the correct translation, because you understand from that that it means the human being must be in pain and suffering, right?\r\n                            42:23\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: No, no, that's why I said (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: What do you understand when you read it?\r\n                            42:28\r\n                            If you can convey it to us in English. Dr. Sabahi: I can't relate to the pain the way it is.\r\n                            42:34\r\n                            (unintelligible) You're not born, (unintelligible)\r\n                            42:41\r\n                            You make the wrong decision at the beginning. You decided to go through this suffering.\r\n                            42:48\r\n                            (unintelligible) something like this, that you made the wrong decision when you said (unintelligible)\r\n                            42:56\r\n                            in these conditions. These conditions are tough, but the ones who are believers who are on the right path,\r\n                            43:03\r\n                            they can succeed, and overcome all these miseries and pain. (unintelligible)\r\n                            43:09\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, that would be incorrect interpretation. Therefore, this is the correct translation here.\r\n                            43:17\r\n                            [90:4] We created the human being to work hard (to redeem himself).* Because there is no pain and suffering for the believers.\r\n                            43:24\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: While the Arabic says (فِى كَبَدٍ). FI (فِى) means \"in.\" Dr. Khalifa: Not necessarily. Not necessarily. (فِى كَبَدٍ) would be\r\n                            43:32\r\n                            Because of the word KABAD, it would be \"to work hard.\"\r\n                            43:42\r\n                            There are other FI (فِى) words that do not mean \"in.\"\r\n                            43:49\r\n                            For example, when they say, (11:110) إِنَّهُمْ لَفِى شَكٍّۢ مِّنْهُ مُرِيبٍۢ (فِى شَكٍّۢ) means \"they have doubts.\"\r\n                            43:55\r\n                            So, it is not exactly \"in.\" Sometimes it is \"in.\"\r\n                            Explains pain and suffering during tests.\r\n                            44:03\r\n                            So, KABAD is a very clear word. I think even the old translation said that. What did the old translation say, Catherine? Verse 4.\r\n                            44:12\r\n                            Catherine: It said (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Ok. Work at it.\r\n                            44:21\r\n                            It's \"exertion.\" KABAD. TAKABADA. It's to exert himself.\r\n                            44:26\r\n                            Thank you for this point, anyway, because it reflects what they're always thinking of pain and suffering.\r\n                            44:32\r\n                            Because they try to justify their life, which is full of pain and suffering.\r\n                            44:38\r\n                            The believers' life has no pain and suffering. It may have... even in the periods of tests,\r\n                            44:43\r\n                            they realize that this is a test that they'll be restored, and the pain and suffering will be gone.\r\n                            44:50\r\n                            Do you remember the pain and suffering you went through when you were one year old? The shocks that went through, do you remember those?\r\n                            44:57\r\n                            Nope. They're gone.\r\n                            45:02\r\n                            So, the pain and suffering in tests will be something that is simple and will go fast.\r\n                            45:08\r\n                            It will be forgotten, and you'll be restored. Other questions?\r\n                            45:14\r\n                            David?\r\n                            45:19\r\n                            You look like you wanna ask a question. Ok. Sura 91 is entitled \"The Sun.\"\r\n                            45:25\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: I have a comment that (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Ok. Go ahead. We missed you for a few weeks. How was Italy, anyway?\r\n                            45:31\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: (unintelligible) One thing that (unintelligible)\r\n                            45:40\r\n                            It's amazing (unintelligible) but it is a clear indication of how religion (unintelligible) but\r\n                            45:50\r\n                            I was thinking of how many people died because (unintelligible). So, I think it's a clear example of (unintelligible).\r\n                            46:03\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: You've seen the statue of Jesus where the foot is all worn down from touching it? You see that one, the main building of the Vatican, and you walk\r\n                            46:12\r\n                            about 50 yards to the right, they have a statue of Jesus, and people touch the foot of it, and it's worn down.\r\n                            46:18\r\n                            Half the foot has got dropped, right? Just from touching it, it's worn down.\r\n                            46:23\r\n                            And they're proud of that, actually. They show it off. Have you seen that clip? You went to the Vatican.\r\n                            46:32\r\n                            That's, you know, an amazing demonstration of idol worship. And then they have the tombs of some saints in the basement.\r\n                            46:39\r\n                            Did you go to those, Mahmoud? In the basement of the Vatican, they have some tombs of Peter and some other saints.\r\n                            46:49\r\n                            You ran away fast.\r\n                            46:54\r\n                            I investigated the whole thing. It was just repulsive, just as repulsive as the Prophet's Mosque in Medina.\r\n                            47:01\r\n                            Go ahead. Dr. Sabahi: (unintelligible)\r\n                            47:15\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Exactly, yes. Dr. Sabahi: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            47:26\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: It's beautiful, yes. Yes. Dr. Sabahi: (unintelligible)\r\n                            47:32\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yes, very good point, Mã Shã Allãh. Don't be a slave of your job, your spouse, your children or...\r\n                            47:40\r\n                            Be a slave of God alone.\r\n                            47:48\r\n                            Okay, we're ready for Sura number 91. In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\r\n                            47:56\r\n                            [91:1] By the sun and its brightness. [91:2] The moon that follows it. [91:3] The day that reveals. [91:4] The night that covers.\r\n                            48:02\r\n                            [91:5] The sky and Him who built it. [91:6] The earth and Him who sustains it. [91:7] The soul and Him who created it. [91:8] Then showed it what is evil and what is good.\r\n                            48:13\r\n                            [91:9] Successful is one who redeems it. [91:10] Failing is one who neglects it.\r\n                            48:19\r\n                            [91:11] Thamoud's disbelief caused them to transgress. [91:12] They followed the worst among them.\r\n                            48:26\r\n                            [91:13] GOD's messenger said to them, \"This is GOD's camel; let her drink.\"\r\n                            48:32\r\n                            [91:14] They disbelieved him and slaughtered her. Their Lord then requited them for their sin and annihilated them. [91:15] Yet, those who came after them remain heedless.\r\n                            48:43\r\n                            Again, we see in the first verses, some of God's profound signs that remind us of God's greatness.\r\n                            48:49\r\n                            And why we should be worshipping God alone. [91:1] By the sun and its brightness.\r\n                            48:54\r\n                            Do you have any idea how hot the sun is? How bright it is?\r\n                            “Mohammad or Jesus had nothing to do with creating the sun”\r\n                            49:05\r\n                            93 million miles away. And you go out at noon there, and with a lens you can actually burn anything.\r\n                            49:14\r\n                            You can put a piece of paper in the lens, in the focal point, you can burn the paper.\r\n                            49:20\r\n                            It's very bright and very hot. And Muhammad or Jesus had nothing to do with creating that sun.\r\n                            49:31\r\n                            Saint Jude had nothing to do with creating that sun, or adding a single atom to it.\r\n                            49:37\r\n                            Yet, the people thank him for their successful operations.\r\n                            49:44\r\n                            [91:1] By the sun and its brightness. [91:2] The moon that follows it.\r\n                            49:51\r\n                            What is the moon? It's something hanging in space. That we flew to the moon and we went around it.\r\n                            50:00\r\n                            Something that's hanging in space. And synchronized the movement with the earth.\r\n                            50:06\r\n                            So, you see only one side of the moon. These are the profound signs that God gives us to remind us of His greatness.\r\n                            50:13\r\n                            [91:2] The moon that follows it. [91:3] The day that reveals.\r\n                            50:18\r\n                            You can see everything during the daylight. [91:4] The night that covers.\r\n                            50:25\r\n                            The night and the day are other profound signs of God.\r\n                            50:31\r\n                            In fact, last night, I saw that phenomenon of the night rolling over the day and the day rolling over the night.\r\n                            50:39\r\n                            I left St. Louis about 8 o'clock at night.\r\n                            50:45\r\n                            And I watched the part of the... If you travel after sunset, you can see it.\r\n                            50:52\r\n                            You can look in the window in this area and there is light and that area it's pitch black. It's very dark.\r\n                            50:57\r\n                            And you can see the night rolling over the day. And you can imagine the earth turning.\r\n                            51:08\r\n                            The sun set and the night overtaking the day. These are profound signs of God.\r\n                            51:16\r\n                            And the miraculous things in the Quran and the infallibility of the Quran is manifested in the fact\r\n                            51:21\r\n                            that God says \"when the world ends half will be at night and half will be in the day.\r\n                            51:26\r\n                            God says \"our command will come to it during the day or the night.\" Cause half the earth will be daylight and half the earth will be at night.\r\n                            51:35\r\n                            If it was a human written book, they would have made a stupid mistake. \"Our command will come at 12 noon.\"\r\n                            51:45\r\n                            Well, 12 noon New York time or Tucson time. It's an infallible book.\r\n                            51:54\r\n                            Another profound sign number 5, [91:5] The sky and Him who built it.\r\n                            Saudis insist on seeing the new moon. “Redeeming our souls” explained. Nicest people in the world neglect their souls.\r\n                            52:01\r\n                            Trillions, decillions of heavenly bodies in precise orbits, never crashing with one another.\r\n                            52:09\r\n                            By the way, you opened, we opened the... Ihsan Ramadan, I was in her house the day before yesterday.\r\n                            52:16\r\n                            And we got the newspaper to see what time is sunrise, what time is sunset, the Washington Post.\r\n                            52:21\r\n                            You can get the Washington Post here, even the library. And as it turns out, they give you the rise and set of every member of the solar system,\r\n                            52:29\r\n                            Venus and Mars and Jupiter, the moon, the sun. They give you the sunrise and moon and sunset.\r\n                            52:36\r\n                            The moon rise and moon set, everyday. The Mars rise and the Mars set. The Venus rise and the Venus set.\r\n                            52:43\r\n                            We know it by fractions of minutes. And the dummies in Saudi Arabia still want to watch the moon to fast Ramadan.\r\n                            52:52\r\n                            They have to see the moon to fast Ramadan. Every morning in the Washington Post, you can just check it in the library.\r\n                            52:59\r\n                            They give you the sunrise, the moon rise, the Venus rise, the Mars rise, the Jupiter, Saturn.\r\n                            53:05\r\n                            It's under the list called the solar system. Rise and set.\r\n                            53:11\r\n                            That's how precise God's system is. And we're just talking about the solar system, which is a minute mote in our universe, within the Milky Way galaxy.\r\n                            53:23\r\n                            There are billions of suns in our Milky Way galaxy, and ours is one of the tiny ones.\r\n                            53:32\r\n                            [91:5] The sky and Him who built it. Muhammad or Jesus or Mary had nothing to do with the Mars rise and Mars set, every day.\r\n                            53:43\r\n                            Number 6, [91:6] The earth and Him who sustains it.\r\n                            53:52\r\n                            Have you seen the big trees in the Redwood National Park, North California?\r\n                            54:01\r\n                            Those are fantastic creatures that God sustains. Was it 1,500 years, the big tree? Edip. What was it?\r\n                            54:11\r\n                            You didn't set the camera right, so we don't have the picture. of the big tree.\r\n                            54:17\r\n                            Was it 1,500 years? Oh, A little older than your grandfather.\r\n                            54:23\r\n                            1,500 years. Yes, that's another one. (unintelligible) Yes.\r\n                            54:28\r\n                            A man: Interestingly enough, the oldest, you know, living organism (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Yes, yes.\r\n                            54:34\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible) years. I mean, 10,000 years (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Wow.\r\n                            54:44\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: That's older than America, isn't it? A man: That's older than everything.\r\n                            54:50\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: That big tree in the Redwood National Park, 1,500 years. So, that's 1,300 years before America was born,\r\n                            54:58\r\n                            when that tree started. And it's huge.\r\n                            55:05\r\n                            We tried to make Lisa surround the tree with her arms.\r\n                            55:18\r\n                            Even if we put Frank next to the tree, he will look like a tiny person there.\r\n                            55:24\r\n                            It's the amazing creature that God sustains. [91:6] The earth and Him who sustains it. Number 7,\r\n                            55:29\r\n                            [91:7] The soul and Him who created it. God created the soul and made it invisible.\r\n                            55:38\r\n                            Number 8, again the message. [91:8] Then showed it what is evil and what is good.\r\n                            55:44\r\n                            What is evil is idol worship and what is good is worshiping God alone. It's as simple as that.\r\n                            55:50\r\n                            [91:9] Successful is one who redeems it. That's the objective of our life, right there.\r\n                            55:55\r\n                            Number 9, redeem your soul by feeding it every day, Five Prayers, being charitable, being righteous.\r\n                            56:05\r\n                            Never lie, cheat, be a person of your word. You must be an ideal, exemplary person of moral behavior.\r\n                            56:20\r\n                            In every respect. [91:9] Successful is one who redeems it. [91:10] Failing is one who neglects it.\r\n                            56:30\r\n                            See, it's mostly neglect. Most people out there in the street, they're neglecting their soul. They can be the nicest people in the world, but they're neglecting to feed their souls.\r\n                            56:40\r\n                            They have to worship God alone to grow and develop.\r\n                            56:46\r\n                            And then we're given examples from 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 of Thamoud and how they didn't listen to God's messenger and they ended up incurring retribution.\r\n                            56:57\r\n                            And number 15 tells us to learn from those examples and thank you very much and God bless you. We're gonna have the children sing for us.\r\n                            57:04\r\n                            Unless you have any questions about Sura 91 and let's see who's gonna give the Quranic next time and the Jumu'ah.\r\n                            57:13\r\n                            You're gonna be stuck with it.

Is Sarah here?\r\n                            57:31\r\n                            And where is Alia? Where is Alia? Is she here? Come here. Come here. Come here. You're birthday girl.

[82:18] What a day; the Day of Judgment!\r\n                            1:00:11\r\n                            [82:19] That is the day when no soul can help another soul, and all decisions, on that day, will belong to GOD.\r\n                            1:00:26\r\n                            Also, this chapter starts with a description of ending of the world and the resurrection.\r\n                            1:00:36\r\n                            And then asks a question in the verse 6, asks a question about diversion of people and then inform us\r\n                            1:00:54\r\n                            recorders that record every action, our every speech, every word, then in verse 9 and\r\n                            1:01:10\r\n                            15, we find the same word but in different meaning where the DIN (دِّينِ) in Arabic in the verse 9\r\n                            1:01:21\r\n                            it is in the...its meaning is \"religion\" but in verse 15, we find it as the Day of Judgment Yawm Al-Din (يَوْمَ ٱلدِّينِ).\r\n                            1:01:34\r\n                            And the description of Yawm al-Din excludes all, excludes all intercession, all kind of intercession.\r\n                            1:01:48\r\n                            That day, the dominion, everything will be... the decision will belong to God. Nobody will help each other.\r\n                            1:01:59\r\n                            It is the only chapter that ends with word \"God.\" The word \"God\" only here is the last word and it is in 19th, in the verse 19.\r\n                            1:02:14\r\n                            And from the end, it is also the 19th word of \"God.\" (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:02:22\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Can I explain that?

Edip: Here, this chapter is the only chapter that ends with \"Allah\", with word \"Allah.\" You can find near 19 word \"Allah.\"\r\n                            1:02:36\r\n                            And this is the 19th verse, the verse number is 19, and if you count from the end of the Quran, the word \"Allah\",\r\n                            1:02:44\r\n                            and you will come here this... you find this, this is the 19th word \"Allah\" from the end. Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:02:54\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Mã Shã Allãh. Dr. Khalifa: Do you have any question?\r\n                            1:03:10\r\n                            Edip: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: The word \"God\"?\r\n                            1:03:22\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: It's a piece of information. This is the only Sura that ends with the word \"God.\"\r\n                            1:03:27\r\n                            And this happens to be in verse 19 and it ends with the 19th word \"God\" from the of the Quran.\r\n                            1:03:34\r\n                            This is on top of the last 19 words \"God\" in the Quran. If you count from here to the end of the Quran, the word \"God\",\r\n                            1:03:41\r\n                            you'll find 19 of them. And this is also verse 19. So, there's a a unique... there's something special.\r\n                            1:03:50\r\n                            Yes. Is this a human design? Dr. Khalifa: Is it possible that a human being designed it this way?\r\n                            1:03:58\r\n                            So, the significance is that this is a super human design. In other words, you know that God is speaking to you, not Muhammad or somebody trying to pull your leg\r\n                            1:04:09\r\n                            So, it just meshes in with the interlocking of this mathematical system.\r\n                            1:04:17\r\n                            If you look at the bottom of the page, you see the number 1 on the left and 2680 on the right.\r\n                            1:04:23\r\n                            This is the....there's only one word God on this page and this is recorded on the left side. The total, up to this page, is 2680.\r\n                            1:04:30\r\n                            And you know, at the end, the total is 2698. So, if you count this word \"God\" as one, the last one will be 19.\r\n                            1:04:40\r\n                            And this is verse 19. So, who made this design? This is the significance of it. That it is a super human design. It could not possibly be Muhammad who designed it this way.\r\n                            1:04:56\r\n                            Edip: And I want to point out something. About Yawm Al-Din, we see in Sura, chapter, Fãtehah that we always reciting our Prayers,\r\n                            1:05:08\r\n                            we say \"Maliki Yawm Eddeen\", the king of the Day of Judgment and here Quran explains the\r\n                            1:05:18\r\n                            \"Ywam Al-Din\" Day of Judgment, Quran explains the terms and expressions in Quran that never used before.\r\n                            1:05:38\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Okay, Sura 83. A woman: You know, (unintelligible) This is English phrase. (unintelligble).\r\n                            1:05:54\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Because it doesn't mean \"religion.\" A woman: For DIN? Dr. Khalifa: DAYN. How about DAYN? What does DAYN mean?\r\n                            1:06:05\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No. Edip: Double meaning. DIN. Dr. Khalifa: What is DAYN?\r\n                            1:06:13\r\n                            You know what DAYN is? No, DAYN, not DIN. DAYN.\r\n                            1:06:18\r\n                            A woman: Debt. Dr. Khalifa: Right. Right. Edip: Right. Mã Shã Allãh. What is debt? This is the day where you pay your debt, or you get paid.\r\n                            1:06:29\r\n                            It's the day you get paid. Yawm Al-Dayn or Yawm Al-Din. It's all related.\r\n                            1:06:37\r\n                            It's the Day of Religion, the Day of Debt, where you pay your debt, so you get paid for your...\r\n                            1:06:42\r\n                            A woman: The Day of Judgement before... Dr. Khalifa: Where you open your PRA book. A woman: Right? The Day of Judgement is basically what you could thinking toward the Bible which is described (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:06:53\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: There's nothing wrong with that. It's the same Author. A woman: Right. No, no, I realize....\r\n                            1:07:00\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: But Dayn is... Dayn is debt. Some people look at it this way.\r\n                            1:07:06\r\n                            So, this is a hybrid between Dayn and Din. Yawm Al-Deen.\r\n                            1:07:12\r\n                            I mean, \"religion\" means Din, but also means \"judgment.\" Edip: Day of judgment is a very good (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:07:19\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: There are others specific, using this same word, and it's much more specific.\r\n                            1:07:24\r\n                            I can find it for you. Edip: For what? Dr. Khalifa: ...throughout the Quran. Dr. Khalifa: For Judgment. Day of Judgment. Edip: Is it Yawm Al-Haq?\r\n                            1:07:31\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, Yawm Al-Din. Edip: Yawm Al-Talaq?\r\n                            1:07:42\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yawm Al-Din. A woman: Just the word \"judgement.\" Dr. Khalifa: Din.\r\n                            1:07:48\r\n                            In the Quran, yeah. A woman: But in the language you were talking about, the judgment.\r\n                            1:07:56\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: But that will be not the context of the Day of Judgment, even in the Bible.\r\n                            1:08:03\r\n                            Judgment in the Bible, most of the word, the usage of the word Judgment in the Bible means punishment.\r\n                            1:08:10\r\n                            In the Bible. It's not a day of punishment. It's a day of receiving recompense, or paying for your sins, either way.\r\n                            1:08:33\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, but the Day of Judgment in the Bible is not the same way as the word \"judgment\" throughout the Bible.\r\n                            1:08:39\r\n                            We have two usages of the word judgment in the Bible. But I'm for using the same terms in the Bible. I'm trying to harmonize the Bible and the Quran.\r\n                            1:08:51\r\n                            Not the other way around.\r\n                            1:08:58\r\n                            What would the day of religion mean?\r\n                            1:09:05\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible) if you use the... No, that's not what it says, no.\r\n                            1:09:14\r\n                            Would you like tea/tee? You do? You play golf a lot?\r\n                            1:09:20\r\n                            So, why do you like it, then? I'm talking about golf. Tee.\r\n                            1:09:26\r\n                            You tee off in golf? That's it?\r\n                            1:09:32\r\n                            Well, I'm asking you. I'm asking you. I used the same word. A woman: You said \"do you like to tee off?\"\r\n                            1:09:38\r\n                            A woman: I would have understood exactly what you meant. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: Well, I was deliberately vague.\r\n                            1:09:44\r\n                            A woman: No, I get your meaning that there are... Dr. Khalifa: You never play golf, yet tee/tea is okay.\r\n                            1:09:52\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Let me think of something else. A woman: No, no, I know what you mean. Ambiguity of language, certainly, or double meaning.\r\n                            1:09:58\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Multiple meanings. Yes. A woman: Yeah, but it just seems to me that this particular word, in Arabic, is the only time that means judgement in both expressions of the Quran.\r\n                            1:10:07\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, that's not true, yeah. This is what I'm saying. There are places in the Quran where it is clear. I'll find them for you.\r\n                            1:10:15\r\n                            But I wanna find the English expressions that are in multiple meanings. A woman: In Arabic language, the only place where this word is translated as judgement is in this expression.\r\n                            1:10:29\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, but the Quran is the Arabic language. A man: But you can play also that (unintelligible) Day of Judgement.\r\n                            1:10:34\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: This is the Day of Reckoning. A man: Yeah. Dr. Khalifa: The Day of Reckoning. A man: Yes.\r\n                            1:10:40\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: It's different. (Unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: No, what does the Day of Religion mean?\r\n                            1:10:46\r\n                            Edip: It has no meaning. Dr. Khalifa: Right. Edip: Yes, it has no meaning. See. So, therefore, this is not... if you say \"I drink... I tea off at the golf\", meaning you put a cup of tea on the thing and you hit it with a club,\r\n                            1:10:59\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: you know, that would be the wrong usage. Edip: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: So, if you say the Day of Religion, it would be like that.\r\n                            1:11:17\r\n                            A woman: ...It means you disbelieve in the religion. The day of the religion, the day when your religion (unintelligible) is (unintelligible). I mean, I can understand (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:11:30\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: So, why don't you use the Day of Judgement? Dr. Khalifa: So, why not use the Day of Judgement? A woman: Because it is not an accurate translation.\r\n                            1:11:38\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, it is. Yeah. Dr. Khalifa: It is not accurate to say Day of Religion. A man: I don't know Arabic, but you know Arabic, right?\r\n                            1:11:47\r\n                            A man: But when you read that, it's probably (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:11:52\r\n                            If you understand the Arabic so when you say that you translated it literally, for example\r\n                            1:11:59\r\n                            (unintelligible) because you also know the Arabic, but we don't know the Arabic If you put something, when you're making a translation, if you put it literally, okay, we may not get the meaning in the other languages.\r\n                            1:12:12\r\n                            But you can because you also know the original. A man: I don't know if you actually get the...\r\n                            1:12:18\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yes, this is true in some other places. But this happens to be the literal translation of Yawm Al-Din is the Day of Judgement.\r\n                            1:12:25\r\n                            I'm still thinking of English equivalents. Huh?\r\n                            1:12:32\r\n                            Yeah, what does... A man: Separate meanings. Dr. Khalifa: Yeah.\r\n                            1:12:38\r\n                            Okay. Let's find simpler words. Think of multiple-meaning English words.\r\n                            1:12:46\r\n                            That's a good one. This is a good one. Come on, Lydia.\r\n                            1:12:51\r\n                            Give us multiple-meaning English words. Like tea/tee.\r\n                            1:12:57\r\n                            Lydia: Read/Red Lydia: Read a book. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Read/Red. Edip: Sea/See, Rashad. Dr. Khalifa: Yes, very good. Red/Read.\r\n                            1:13:04\r\n                            A woman: Sea, like the ocean Dr. Khalifa: Sea/See. Sea, the ocean and see with your...\r\n                            1:13:09\r\n                            Edip: In translation. A man: (unintelligible). Those are spelled differently. You know like, See/Sea is S E E and S E A. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            1:13:17\r\n                            A man: Read/Read/Red is spelled differenly. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. No, I want words that spell exactly the same way.\r\n                            1:13:23\r\n                            A man: Read and Read. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. A man: (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Right. A woman: But they're a bit ambiguous in a sense since one of them is noun and one of them is verb.\r\n                            1:13:33\r\n                            A man: Well, to an extent, there's a word like (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:13:39\r\n                            A woman: It doesn't matter. I didn't mean... I don't dare to... How about meet? Okay, meet.\r\n                            1:13:46\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Is there a word that meet a judgment? A man: Yes. \"Meet\" means fair or just. It also means, you know, to meet, to encounter.\r\n                            1:13:56\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Is it M-E-E-T, both of them? A man: Yes, they're both M-E. Dr. Khalifa: Okay. A man: Although MEET is equitable to fair is not used anymore.\r\n                            1:14:04\r\n                            A woman: It's very archaic. That's very archaic.\r\n                            1:14:10\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Well, this is 1,400 years old Arabic. A man: Okay.\r\n                            1:14:17\r\n                            Edip: I'm going on, people. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Edip: Chapter 83.\r\n                            1:14:23\r\n                            The Cheaters Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem [83:1] Woe to the cheaters.\r\n                            1:14:29\r\n                            [83:2] Who demand full measure when receiving from the people. [83:3] But when giving them the measures or weights, they cheat.\r\n                            1:14:38\r\n                            [83:4] Do they not know that they will be resurrected?\r\n                            1:14:43\r\n                            [83:5] On a tremendous day? [83:6] That is the day when all people will stand before the Lord of the universe.\r\n                            1:14:54\r\n                            [83:7] Indeed, the book of the wicked is in Sijjeen. [83:8] Do you know what Sijjeen is?\r\n                            1:15:00\r\n                            [83:9] A numerically structured book. [83:10] Woe on that day to the rejectors.\r\n                            1:15:06\r\n                            [83:11] They do not believe in the Day of Judgment. [83:12] None disbelieves therein except the transgressor, the sinful.\r\n                            1:15:15\r\n                            [83:13] When our revelations are recited to him, he says, \"Tales from the past!\"\r\n                            1:15:21\r\n                            [83:14] Indeed, their hearts have become shielded by their sins.\r\n                            1:15:27\r\n                            [83:15] Indeed, they will be isolated, on that day, from their Lord. [83:16] Then they will be thrown into Hell.\r\n                            1:15:35\r\n                            [83:17] They will be told, \"This is what you used to deny.\"\r\n                            1:15:52\r\n                            Here, God blames those people who cheat people and this is an example of cheating, but you can,\r\n                            1:16:11\r\n                            you can, from this example, you can derive many other examples.\r\n                            1:16:19\r\n                            And God reminds them the Day of Resurrection because they will be (unintelligible) from their every minute acts.\r\n                            1:16:32\r\n                            And that day, the Lord of the universe only be the Judge.\r\n                            1:16:41\r\n                            And in verse 9, we see a description of Sijjeen, a book of the wicked people that's called Sijjeen.\r\n                            1:16:55\r\n                            It's a numerically structured book.\r\n                            1:17:00\r\n                            And God says \"whenever they hear the revelations or the signs or the miracles recited to them,\r\n                            1:17:10\r\n                            they say, \"Tales from the past.\"\r\n                            1:17:19\r\n                            It's noteworthy that for the miracle 19, in Turkey, they published a book that they criticized. They object (to) this miracle.\r\n                            1:17:35\r\n                            The name of the book was \"Tales from the past.\"\r\n                            1:17:40\r\n                            The name of the book. And \"19; Tales from the past.\"\r\n                            1:17:49\r\n                            AFSANE Do you know word AFSANE? Yes. And they just use the same expression that's described in Quran.\r\n                            1:18:00\r\n                            In Turkey, we have many words to condemn miracle 19.\r\n                            1:18:05\r\n                            They have many words. But they're stuck just in this unique expression that's prophesied in Quran.\r\n                            1:18:16\r\n                            It's a prophecy of Quran. I think in verse 13, \"When our revelations\", instead of \"revelation\", if a word that has double meaning used would be better.\r\n                            1:18:33\r\n                            Edip: Because in Quran, in original text, word AYAT has been used, which means either miracle and revelations, both of them. Dr. Khalifa: Miracles.\r\n                            1:18:46\r\n                            Edip: include miracle and also revelations, but in English, it becomes narrow.\r\n                            1:18:57\r\n                            And let's go. There is an interesting difference between righteous people and wicked people on the Day of Judgment\r\n                            1:19:08\r\n                            in connection with the books, Sijjeen or Elleyyeen. Let's go on. I'm verse 18.\r\n                            1:19:15\r\n                            [83:18] Indeed, the book of the righteous will be in 'Elleyyeen. [83:19] Do you know what 'Elleyyeen is?\r\n                            1:19:22\r\n                            [83:20] A numerically structured book. It is the same book.\r\n                            1:19:27\r\n                            The description is the same, Elleyyeen or Sijjeen, but it's different.\r\n                            1:19:32\r\n                            For the wicked people, a book called Sijjeen. But God says \"what is Sijjeen?\"\r\n                            1:19:38\r\n                            [83:9] A numerically structured book. And for the righteous people also, there is a book called \"Elleyyeen.\" The name is only different, but the description is the same.\r\n                            1:19:48\r\n                            [83:20] A numerically structured book. (83:20) كِتَـٰبٌۭ مَّرْقُومٌۭ\r\n                            1:19:54\r\n                            Let's go on to find an answer to our question. [83:21] To be witnessed by those close to Me.\r\n                            1:20:02\r\n                            [83:22] The righteous have deserved bliss. [83:23] On luxurious furnishings they watch.\r\n                            1:20:08\r\n                            [83:24] You recognize in their faces the joy of bliss. [83:25] Their drinks will be spiced with nectar.\r\n                            1:20:15\r\n                            [83:26] Its spice is like musk. This is what the competitors should compete for.\r\n                            1:20:22\r\n                            [83:27] Mixed into it will be special flavors. [83:28] From a spring that is reserved for those close to Me.\r\n                            1:20:30\r\n                            [83:29] The wicked used to laugh at those who believed. [83:30] When they passed by them, they used to poke fun.\r\n                            1:20:38\r\n                            [83:31] When they got together with their people, they used to joke. [83:32] Whenever they saw them, they said, \"These people are far astray!\r\n                            1:20:46\r\n                            [83:33] \"They have no such thing as (invisible) guards.\" [83:34] Today, those who believed are laughing at the disbelievers.\r\n                            1:20:54\r\n                            [83:35] On luxurious furnishings they watch. [83:36] Most assuredly, the disbelievers are requited for what they did.\r\n                            1:21:07\r\n                            And now I'm going back on verse 19 and 20.\r\n                            1:21:14\r\n                            And I repeat my question to you. Can you notice the difference between Elleyyeen or Sijjeen that's described in verse 7?\r\n                            1:21:25\r\n                            What is difference?\r\n                            1:21:32\r\n                            Excuse me? Yes.\r\n                            1:21:39\r\n                            What? Where? Where? Oh.\r\n                            1:21:46\r\n                            Why do you add three of them? You can add four or...\r\n                            1:21:56\r\n                            The description is the same. Yes. A man: One interpretation is probably (unintelligible) talking, to be spoken to hear it one sense of (unintelligible) in terms of doing business.\r\n                            1:22:15\r\n                            In one sense, a very structured book is a person keeping records of what sort of money he'd\r\n                            1:22:21\r\n                            be taking in and what he'd be paying out, and things like that. He'd certainly be an idol. In his entire life, he'd be worshipped.\r\n                            1:22:29\r\n                            But in another sense, Elleyyeen, of course, refer to miracles God.\r\n                            1:22:37\r\n                            We know He exists today. Or in another sense, it's just a literal application of the individual person.\r\n                            1:22:54\r\n                            Edip: Thank you. Edip: I have a comment on this, or understanding. In verse 20 to 21, Allah, God describes the difference.\r\n                            1:23:06\r\n                            The difference is, righteous people could read Elleyyeen, their book, their numerically structured book. They can read.\r\n                            1:23:15\r\n                            [83:21] To be witnessed by those close to Me. But wicked people, they cannot understand. They cannot read numerically structured book.\r\n                            1:23:23\r\n                            Their book will be written in numerical code. Their deeds will be recorded in numerical code. They are not familiar with this.\r\n                            1:23:33\r\n                            In this world, they always deny, used to deny, to object this numerical code.\r\n                            1:23:40\r\n                            But believers, they are familiar, they can read. And this is the only difference here.\r\n                            1:23:46\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: I thought you'll say something else. I thought you were gonna say something else. So, I will say it. I think the numerically structured book is the Quran.\r\n                            1:23:54\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: But the wicked will call it \"tales from the past\", and the righteous will be able to see it. Edip: Mã Shã Allãh.\r\n                            “numerical structured book” is the Quran, explained.\r\n                            1:24:01\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Because God uses the same word as the elite of the elite. Al-Muqarrabun (ٱلْمُقَرَّبُونَ), those who are close to Me.\r\n                            1:24:07\r\n                            He said \"only those, only the elite of the elite, will be permitted to see the miracle of the Quran.\r\n                            1:24:12\r\n                            It's right here. Only the elite of the elite will be able to see it.\r\n                            1:24:18\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: It's a physical miracle. Edip: Mã Shã Allãh. Yes. Edip: It is Quran, Rashad. Dr. Khalifa: But the definition in 9 and in 20, same, same description. \"A numerically structured book.\"\r\n                            1:24:33\r\n                            The wicked will call it \"tales from the past\", and the righteous will witness it. Edip: Mã Shã Allãh.\r\n                            1:24:39\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: You agree, eh? Edip: Good. Edip: Just wonderful. Mã Shã Allãh. Yes. Edip: It solves all things, Mã Shã Allãh.\r\n                            1:24:48\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: It's the same book, but also this ties in with the verses that you know, where it says that the Quran increases their wickedness.\r\n                            1:24:57\r\n                            Or in other places, the Quran causes them to plunge deeper in disbelief.\r\n                            1:25:03\r\n                            Edip: Their book, they record also in Quran, Rashad. Quran describes all offenses and their punishment.\r\n                            1:25:09\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Edip: This is their book, our book, also. Yes. Dr. Khalifa: Exactly. Yes. Dr. Khalifa: Yes, go ahead.\r\n                            1:25:16\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No. Dr. Khalifa: But it necessarily refers to the Quran.\r\n                            1:25:23\r\n                            Edip: No, no, necessarily refers to Quran, yes. Edip: Mã Shã Allãh. Yes. Good.\r\n                            1:25:29\r\n                            Because there is difference. Only difference, righteous people can understand this. The other will say \"tales from the past.\"\r\n                            1:25:37\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: You know how the disbelievers say \"the Quran is full of Hell and fire and brimstone?\" Well, that's what they see.\r\n                            1:25:46\r\n                            But it is, as you know, half and half. So, it depends on which half you see.\r\n                            1:25:52\r\n                            Edip: Mã Shã Allãh. Dr. Khalifa: Oh, we better quit.\r\n                            1:26:00\r\n                            Edip: And let's go on. I have another.... Edip: No, no, no.\r\n                            1:26:05\r\n                            Edip: On this Sura, verse 29, they used to laugh at believers, but now, do they laugh at us, Rashad?\r\n                            1:26:19\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Sure do. Edip: They must be more crazy. They do not laugh too much.\r\n                            1:26:26\r\n                            It is interesting. Dr. Khalifa: Yes, they do laugh at the believers.\r\n                            1:26:31\r\n                            Edip: Ok. Let's go. Dr. Khalifa: But we will laugh at them for eternity. Dr. Khalifa: Thank you very much. God bless you. Good job.\r\n                            \r\n                            \r\n                            18 Quran Study From Behrouz 818 Sura 61 & Sura 87 & Sura 94 By Rashad Sura 81 By Edip No 8\r\n                            \r\n                            \r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: You see this word only for prophet. This is a clue that it's just a... the lesson to learn from it as a history, as a historical event.\r\n                            0:07\r\n                            The thing that happened during the Prophet's time. Because they needed those rules also in those days, for a few hundred years.\r\n                            0:16\r\n                            That these rules apply, applicable to war specifically. In our case, we derive the general principles.\r\n                            0:25\r\n                            Right? Why would women or men secretly do this? A man: Well, I'm just saying, it would be like, first of all, (unintelligible).\r\n                            0:34\r\n                            Saying, you know, (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: No, okay, I understand now what you're saying. See, verse 12 is the testing process.\r\n                            0:46\r\n                            This is how you test them. This is the title of the Sura. Tested woman.\r\n                            0:52\r\n                            So, if a woman comes and joins the believers in war, this is how you test them.\r\n                            0:58\r\n                            You make them pledge that they will not idolize... where is it? Never set up idols besides God, nor steal, nor commit adultery,\r\n                            1:06\r\n                            nor kill their children, nor invent any falsehood. Nor disobey the Prophet's righteous orders.\r\n                            1:13\r\n                            So, this was the testing process. Which criteria? How do you test them? This is how you test them.\r\n                            1:20\r\n                            \"Do you pledge you'll never set up idols beside God?\" \"Yes.\" \"Do you pledge you'll worship God alone?\" \"Yes.\" (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:25\r\n                            So, this is how we decide not to send them back to disbelievers in the case of war.\r\n                            1:32\r\n                            Philip? Philip: I think I got my answer. Dr. Khalifa: I'm glad you brought that up.\r\n                            1:37\r\n                            This is a very important statement because it says \"o, you prophet...\" And as you know, the Sunnis claim that you must obey the Prophet, whatever he says.\r\n                            1:47\r\n                            This tells us that not all his orders should be obeyed, only his righteous orders.\r\n                            1:54\r\n                            Or the good things that he says. That he can say wrong things.\r\n                            2:00\r\n                            And I have this in the book Quran, Hadith and Islam. It is one of the strongest proofs against Hadith and Sunnah.\r\n                            2:10\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Was that your question? A woman: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: Very good point. I wanted to test this, but unless it came out.\r\n                            2:18\r\n                            It is, it is Sura 61.\r\n                            2:23\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: The Column A woman: The Column A woman: In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.\r\n                            2:30\r\n                            [61:1] Glorifying GOD is everything in the heavens and the earth. He is the Almighty, Most Wise.\r\n                            2:36\r\n                            [61:2] O you who believe, why do you utter what you do not do yourself? What? Dr. Khalifa: It's like the invention of Hadith.\r\n                            2:43\r\n                            And the list of prohibitions and lies about God.\r\n                            2:52\r\n                            What's more, the fellow who came to save me, his wife, you could see only her glasses.\r\n                            2:59\r\n                            She was completely covered. And she would not utter a voice because they teach them that the voice is like getting naked.\r\n                            Tyrannical dress code for woman.\r\n                            3:08\r\n                            That's what they teach them. So, she just couldn't talk.\r\n                            3:15\r\n                            Yes. Completely covered. It was hot on that day. It was 95 or something outside.\r\n                            3:22\r\n                            This is really mistreatment. So, this is inventing lies because her husband told her that this is the way you're supposed to dress.\r\n                            3:34\r\n                            \"Who is more evil than one who invents lies about God?\" And he's telling her \"God tells you this is the way you're supposed to dress.\"\r\n                            3:41\r\n                            So, it's unfair. It's so unfair.\r\n                            3:47\r\n                            A woman: Okay. Verse 8. Dr. Khalifa: Right. Go ahead.\r\n                            3:52\r\n                            The miracle of the Quran is coming out. John. John: God is mentioning the number 19.\r\n                            4:00\r\n                            One of the greatest miracles in the Quran. And they can speak the language that the Quran was revealed in their own language. They can't see it.\r\n                            4:10\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah. They were stuck in the first letter of the Qur'an. B, B, B, B, B, B\r\n                            4:19\r\n                            John: Ba Dr. Khalifa: They didn't go to the S. And while stuck in the B,\r\n                            4:25\r\n                            God put (unintelligible) them under their feet and turned the miracle into numbers, completely.\r\n                            4:31\r\n                            So, now they're stunned. They really are. They didn't know what to do. They're completely silent.\r\n                            4:39\r\n                            Not a sound. Cause it's utter silence. After all these numbers came out at this time.\r\n                            4:46\r\n                            So, this is a perfect example of God perfecting His light. Also, it has to do with verse 9.\r\n                            4:52\r\n                            Because I assure you the whole world will be Muslim in about 50 years. Because of the mathematical facts that are coming out of the Quran.\r\n                            5:04\r\n                            So, as pioneers, you better familiarize yourself with these physical facts.\r\n                            5:09\r\n                            You see these numbers of the verses in the... Look at the page. Page 396, for example. You see verses 1 to 14.\r\n                            5:19\r\n                            In one of the mathematical miracles of the Quran, you put these numbers 1, 2, 3 next to each other.\r\n                            5:25\r\n                            Somewhere in the line. These numbers put next to each other at the very...\r\n                            5:30\r\n                            They complete number is a multiple of 19. The number of digits themselves is a multiple of 19.\r\n                            5:36\r\n                            So, these are the factors that will make Islam prevail over all religions.\r\n                            5:43\r\n                            Just give the America 50 years and the whole world will be Muslims. I'm talking about true Muslims.\r\n                            5:49\r\n                            And this journalist keeps writing that these are the true right Muslims.\r\n                            5:56\r\n                            She repeated it so many times in the newspaper. We didn't tell her that. She just did it on her own.\r\n                            6:02\r\n                            No. She just invented the name on her own.\r\n                            6:08\r\n                            (unintelligible).\r\n                            6:15\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, because Muhammad is a messenger, too. A prophet and a messenger. But more important is that God didn't say whose name is Muhammad.\r\n                            6:23\r\n                            A man: Why? Dr. Khalifa: Why? Dr. Khalifa: Because Muhammad's name is mentioned in there. A man: This is referring to you.\r\n                            6:33\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: You have to look up the mathematics in the appendix. It will be coming in the new translation.\r\n                            6:39\r\n                            Because there are many mathematical relations here. There's just no time to mention all of them.\r\n                            6:44\r\n                            And they will be detailed in appendix 2 of the new translation.\r\n                            6:53\r\n                            Yeah, verse 13 is telling us that you don't have to wait for the Day of Judgment to enjoy the benefits.\r\n                            God’s protection, Invisible Giants, “Scheming against you”.\r\n                            7:00\r\n                            You can enjoy the benefits now. You have a perfect life now.\r\n                            7:06\r\n                            Guaranteed victory, health, wealth, here, in this life.\r\n                            7:12\r\n                            That's very important. And I think, again, we're not speculating. We're living this experience.\r\n                            7:19\r\n                            We know that I published all over the Muslim world that Hadith is satanic innovations.\r\n                            7:26\r\n                            And I have it printed here since 1982, in the Brown Book that is widely distributed.\r\n                            7:34\r\n                            It's been summarized in many newspapers and criticized and reviewed. But what happened to Salman Rushdie didn't happen to me.\r\n                            7:44\r\n                            Because he's... You see, he's in hiding. He's afraid. He has all these people up in arms.\r\n                            7:52\r\n                            And he didn't say half as much as I did. So, but, I mean, we live these experiences, because God's Word is true.\r\n                            8:02\r\n                            How do you explain that? Except by the Word of God. We have to thank God, Alhamdu Lillah.\r\n                            8:09\r\n                            You don't (unintelligible) any ideas. However, it doesn't matter, even if you get ideas.\r\n                            8:16\r\n                            Remember that you have an invisible giant standing next to you.\r\n                            8:22\r\n                            And it's not just a giant. It's a giant who can hold the whole earth in one hand.\r\n                            8:27\r\n                            So, if somebody's plotting against you in Stockholm, Sweden, your giant will be there\r\n                            8:34\r\n                            taking care of them, just as they plot and scheme. It is true, you better believe it.\r\n                            8:40\r\n                            Because it's mathematically proven in the Quran. And this is the importance of verse 13.\r\n                            8:47\r\n                            We're told that you do your part. And your part in 11 is you believe in God and His Messenger and struggle in the cause of God with your properties and your lives.\r\n                            8:58\r\n                            This is your part. Getting up for the Morning Prayer before sunrise, this is striving.\r\n                            Tests explained i.e. Job.\r\n                            9:05\r\n                            You dedicate, you devote yourself to God. That's your part.\r\n                            9:10\r\n                            Now, God's part is overwhelmingly far better than our part.\r\n                            9:17\r\n                            Because God will give you eternal happiness. And then verse 13 tells you \"this begins here and now.\" Now or forever.\r\n                            9:25\r\n                            Back to verse 14. No, that's not what I'm talking about. That's not what this verse is talking about.\r\n                            9:32\r\n                            It happens automatically. All your resources, everything will be dedicated to God.\r\n                            9:39\r\n                            What happened with Job was Satan said that if You take Job's properties, he will blaspheme against You.\r\n                            9:46\r\n                            Job and Solomon are mentioned together as the two extremes of testing.\r\n                            9:51\r\n                            And again, this is something that doesn't happen now. It's a new era. But it's an example of testing and believing in God under all circumstances.\r\n                            10:01\r\n                            Being devoted to God under all circumstances. So, striving with your life and your properties in the cause of God, it's something that happens automatically.\r\n                            10:10\r\n                            Upon understanding who God is and why you are here and where the provisions come from.\r\n                            10:18\r\n                            They belong to God anyway. It's an extreme example of tests that was OK in those days.\r\n                            10:30\r\n                            He was restored anyway. Everything was restored and twice as much.\r\n                            10:35\r\n                            So, this is to make us understand when we lose something small.\r\n                            10:43\r\n                            As much. But everything will be restored and twice as much.\r\n                            10:49\r\n                            Because Satan may say \"Robert will blaspheme if you destroy his car against You.\"'\r\n                            10:57\r\n                            And God will tell Satan \"OK, go get his RX-7, but you cannot touch him.\"\r\n                            11:04\r\n                            So, he took your RX-7, but he couldn't touch you. That was a miracle, by the way.\r\n                            11:12\r\n                            I mean, Robert's car was forced under a truck. And after he left the car, he wondered how he was alive in there.\r\n                            11:18\r\n                            That was really miraculous. And this is a perfect example. So, what happened to you is what happened to Job.\r\n                            11:27\r\n                            And, of course, God gave you a better car later on.\r\n                            11:34\r\n                            Yeah, you think how it came to you? It has to be God who gave you that.\r\n                            11:40\r\n                            That's a perfect example. You like your new car better than the RX-7?\r\n                            11:46\r\n                            Robert: Wow. See? It's exactly Job's story.\r\n                            11:54\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Any other questions? A man: Yes. A man: أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ\r\n                            12:01\r\n                            Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem We seek refuge in God from the rejected devil. In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.\r\n                            12:09\r\n                            We are tonight, IN SHAA ALLAH, it's gonna be in Sura 87.\r\n                            12:14\r\n                            Entitled \"The Most High.\"\r\n                            12:20\r\n                            [87:1] Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High. [87:2] He creates and shapes.\r\n                            12:30\r\n                            [87:3] He designs and guides. [87:4] He produces the pasture. [87:5] Then turns it into light hay.\r\n                            12:39\r\n                            The title of this Sura is The Most High. And we see in verse 1 that we are commanded to glorify the name of God, the name of our Lord.\r\n                            12:57\r\n                            And this is a reminder also, which I think is never enough.\r\n                            Follower talks about evolution.\r\n                            13:04\r\n                            We have to keep reminding ourselves that we have to remember God every chance we got.\r\n                            13:13\r\n                            There was a very good explanation. And when I watched that program, I said \"I wish Rashad was there to explain this thing\" because\r\n                            13:22\r\n                            there was one moment where one professor of biology from University of California sat in front of this group.\r\n                            13:31\r\n                            And this group of Institute of Creation Research was represented by one PhD also in biochemistry,\r\n                            13:37\r\n                            graduated from the same school Rashad graduated from, University of California, Riverside. So, it was very interesting, but\r\n                            13:42\r\n                            he brought the argument up to the point that he couldn't further it. But if he had heard that, what Rashad gave in the Khutba, that would be very interesting.\r\n                            13:51\r\n                            Because, at one point, that professor of biology from UC Berkeley said \"we are 99% similar to the apes.\"\r\n                            14:01\r\n                            That's what Rashad mentioned also. 99% and that's very close, you know.\r\n                            14:07\r\n                            But we know that based on what we learned here, 99% similar means there is 1% difference.\r\n                            14:19\r\n                            And 1% difference represents 1% of 300 billion nucleotides that form the genes.\r\n                            14:26\r\n                            Which they say that the evolution says the same. And that is 3 billion.\r\n                            14:31\r\n                            And you have 3 billion combinations. And we know that 84 combinations is zero. The probability is zero that you have a certain combination having 84, you know, items.\r\n                            14:41\r\n                            And we have... we are talking here about 300, not 300, 3 billion nucleotides.\r\n                            14:47\r\n                            And so based on theory of probability, that's zero. But unfortunately in that program, this PhD from UC Riverside didn't say that.\r\n                            14:59\r\n                            He just said \"well, you know, there's still a chance and this and that.\" So basically, I would say that this discussion will be further, you know, in the future that\r\n                            15:07\r\n                            God willing, most people will grab the idea. And they will see that even though the evolution is also a fact, because God says, and we learn from the Quran, that God creates.\r\n                            15:19\r\n                            And in terms of our scale, then the creation undergoes evolution.\r\n                            15:24\r\n                            And this will merge the two theories and will bring the Quranic light into the discussion of creation and evolution.\r\n                            15:36\r\n                            [87:2] He creates and shapes. He shapes because God knows the need of every individual, every living being that He creates.\r\n                            15:49\r\n                            One example that was shown in that program was there was a species of bird who lived in a remote island.\r\n                            15:56\r\n                            And eventually evolved into many different, you know, within the same species, they look different.\r\n                            16:02\r\n                            The beak, one of them is longer, one of them is shorter. The longer beak because they need to get, you know, the nectar from the flower and all that.\r\n                            16:09\r\n                            So, they say \"they evolve according to the need.\" But we know that God knows the need of each individual.\r\n                            16:14\r\n                            And then He creates over time the changes in that shape of the beak, for instance.\r\n                            16:21\r\n                            And so, when we see that example, you know, we wonder about that example and we say \"well,...\"\r\n                            16:28\r\n                            Immediately, we remember God. And we go back to the first, before that, verse number one, we glorify God. We say \"Alhamdu Lillah. Subhan Allah.\"\r\n                            16:35\r\n                            When we see that program. But most people who believe in evolution, who do not believe in God, they say \"well, it evolves.\r\n                            16:41\r\n                            The brain or the bone in the back becomes smaller and smaller and smaller. And over 1,000 years or 10,000 years, it becomes, you know, smaller and the jaw becomes larger and all that.\"\r\n                            16:52\r\n                            But we know that all that is designed by God. And we say \"Alhamdu Lillah.\"\r\n                            17:00\r\n                            Edip, say something. He's facing you now, so you have to say something.\r\n                            17:08\r\n                            \"Overwhelming.\" This is the title of Sura 88. In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.\r\n                            17:16\r\n                            [88:1] Are you aware of the Overwhelming? [88:2] Faces on that day will be shamed. [88:3] Laboring and exhausted. [88:4] Suffering in a blazing Hellfire.\r\n                            17:28\r\n                            [88:5] Drinking from a flaming spring. [88:6] They will have no food except the useless variety.\r\n                            17:35\r\n                            [88:7] It never nourishes, nor satisfies hunger. [88:8] Other faces on that day will be full of joy. [88:9] Satisfied with their work. [88:10] In an exalted Paradise.\r\n                            17:47\r\n                            [88:11] In it, no nonsense is heard. [88:12] In it, a spring flows. [88:13] In it, there are luxurious furnishings.\r\n                            17:53\r\n                            [88:14] And drinks made available. [88:15] And pitchers in rows. [88:16] And carpets throughout.\r\n                            18:01\r\n                            [88:1] Are you aware of the Overwhelming? This is another word or term that is used in the Quran to describe the Day of Judgment.\r\n                            18:11\r\n                            We've seen in the previous Suras. I think we can go back, even though we have done it probably two weeks ago.\r\n                            18:17\r\n                            I can quickly go back to Sura 82, 81. I think 81 and 82 started with the description of the Day of Judgment. 82 says,\r\n                            18:30\r\n                            [82:1] When the heaven is shattered. [82:2] The planets are scattered. [82:3] The oceans are exploded. [82:4] The graves are opened.\r\n                            18:35\r\n                            [82:5] Every soul will find out what caused it to advance, and what caused it to regress.\r\n                            18:40\r\n                            Similar expression in Sura 81. [81:1] When the sun is rolled. [81:2] The stars are crashed into each other. [81:3] The mountains are wiped out.\r\n                            18:48\r\n                            [81:4] The reproduction is halted. [81:5] The beasts are summoned. [81:6] The oceans are set aflame. These are all overwhelming.\r\n                            18:54\r\n                            I mean, these are heavy events.\r\n                            19:00\r\n                            And this will happen in front of everybody. In other words, there will be a real terror on that Day,\r\n                            19:10\r\n                            a real terror for most people. It's a real terror, except for the believers. Because God says that He will send the angels to protect the believers from the event of that Day.\r\n                            19:18\r\n                            But this is the beginning of the Day of Eternity. So, this is the day that will have no end. This is the day that will have...\r\n                            19:29\r\n                            How would I say it? An Eternal Day. So, there is no end to it. It started with all this destruction of the universe.\r\n                            19:36\r\n                            As we know from all these verses I read from 81 and 82, what happens would be the implosion of the universe.\r\n                            19:43\r\n                            Now, we know the universe started with a big bang. And we are now still \"explode.\"\r\n                            19:49\r\n                            We are moving away from each other. I mean, we are in the same solar system.\r\n                            19:57\r\n                            And the solar system is part of the galaxy. But the galaxies are actually moving away from each other.\r\n                            20:03\r\n                            Because we are now still, if we think of a bubble, of a balloon, we are riding in the skin of balloon.\r\n                            20:10\r\n                            And as the balloon is, you know, being...we blow into the balloon, the balloon is getting bigger and bigger. And every point in that surface is getting farther apart.\r\n                            20:18\r\n                            On the Day of Judgment, the opposite will occur. Everything will come back as if somebody is pulling it and will crash, you know.\r\n                            20:24\r\n                            We will crash into each other. And that's why the stars crash and the sun is rolled and the planets disperse.\r\n                            20:31\r\n                            Those are all the descriptions of the Overwhelming. Ocean explodes or ocean is set aflame.\r\n                            20:39\r\n                            I remember something that I read from a geology book recently.\r\n                            20:50\r\n                            That in 1883, most of you probably have heard of Mount Krakatoa.\r\n                            20:56\r\n                            It is actually a small mountain in the middle of the sea, really.\r\n                            21:03\r\n                            But when it exploded in 1883, the whole caldera collapsed. And we know what a volcano is. Volcano is\r\n                            21:09\r\n                            actually a plug to the hot magma chamber. So, when a volcano forms, it really actually separates the magma chamber from the surface.\r\n                            21:20\r\n                            So, when that mountain exploded, the whole thing collapsed. And\r\n                            21:26\r\n                            millions of tons of seawater comes straight into the magma chamber. And the result is a tremendous explosion that was heard 5, 6 thousand miles and caused 3 years of winter in the northern hemisphere.\r\n                            21:41\r\n                            It's a very tremendous occasion. The Day of Judgment will be like, God says \"the mountains are all wiped out.\"\r\n                            21:47\r\n                            So, it will be Krakatoa on the grand scale. I mean, the whole universe.\r\n                            21:52\r\n                            I mean, we're not talking just about the earth, but actually this is the whole universe. A man: About verse 17, I was watching a program on television entitled \"Ship of the Desert.\"\r\n                            22:01\r\n                            Some of you all may have seen it. I'd like to share some of the characteristics of the camels. It's fascinating.\r\n                            22:07\r\n                            One of the reasons why people suffer or die in the sand or desert is because they can't step.\r\n                            22:13\r\n                            You can't put your feet on anything solid. Every time you step, your feet, they just sink in the sand.\r\n                            22:20\r\n                            So, Allah constructed the shape of the camel's foot so when he steps, his feet do not sink\r\n                            22:26\r\n                            in the sand, but they actually lay on top of the sand a few seconds to give him the stability or the animal the stability to walk.\r\n                            22:34\r\n                            That's one attribute of the camel in terms of the shape of its feet. Another one is that during a sandstorm, a camel can close its notched nostrils so no sand will bleed in its nose, and\r\n                            22:47\r\n                            it has an alternative air source. So, you know, here we are out here and we've got these devil storms and sand storms and we're rolling up windows on cars, and all a camel does is this.\r\n                            22:58\r\n                            It just keeps going, you know. A man: Without a finger. A man: Right, without the fingers, I mean, you know, without fingers, and you know,\r\n                            23:05\r\n                            sitting up, you can't help but feel humble while watching this program, it's just incredible.\r\n                            23:10\r\n                            And so it closes its nostrils. Everybody else is taking blankets and everything, covering themselves.\r\n                            23:17\r\n                            Another one is that the hair on the body is primarily just a little hair over the top and right over the sacks,\r\n                            23:24\r\n                            to reflect some of the heat, to prevent the water from evaporating.\r\n                            23:30\r\n                            So, these are some of the characteristics, and now people have these land rovers.\r\n                            23:35\r\n                            I mean, can you think of all the mechanical engineers who were trying to design vehicles to go long distance over the deserts?\r\n                            23:42\r\n                            No one can design like Allah. Camel closes its nostrils, able to put its feet around, and what have you.\r\n                            23:50\r\n                            I thought I share, it was fantastic, watching that. A man: I think there was another thing about the camel's milk.\r\n                            24:00\r\n                            A man: How much you know about it? A man: Yeah, the milk, when the camel dehydrates,...\r\n                            24:05\r\n                            (unintelligible) It takes about 57 days for the camel to be without water.\r\n                            24:15\r\n                            And when it dehydrates, every animal, like cows, for example, when they dehydrate, you take their milk,\r\n                            24:23\r\n                            the milk is so salty and it's undrinkable after it's dehydrated.\r\n                            24:30\r\n                            But the camel's milk stays the same from the first day to the fifty seventh day, the milk, the condition of the water, the nutrition, always the same.\r\n                            24:41\r\n                            Also, when it dehydrates, all animals, when they dehydrate, if we take water, when we take food,\r\n                            24:50\r\n                            the cell cannot hold all that water at the same time. The cell is gone, and you will die unless you take water slowly.\r\n                            25:00\r\n                            The camel can take 400 gallons of water, and the cells will come back better than the way they were.\r\n                            25:08\r\n                            Well, so, (unintelligible).\r\n                            25:15\r\n                            A man: Is there anybody here? (unintelligible) No?\r\n                            25:25\r\n                            A man: Okay, the camel is the only animal whose milk, when the animal dehydrates, like the cows or something,\r\n                            25:37\r\n                            their milk becomes salty, so salty, you cannot drink it.\r\n                            25:42\r\n                            But the camel's milk, the content stays the same for 57 days.\r\n                            25:50\r\n                            I guess that's one of the reasons that it lasts 57 days.\r\n                            25:55\r\n                            So, for a long period of time, still, you drink the milk.\r\n                            26:01\r\n                            The other thing, almost the same.\r\n                            26:07\r\n                            When we dehydrate, if we drink water real fast, then our cells will explode because they cannot take the water.\r\n                            26:16\r\n                            But the camel is not like that. They... God designed in such a way, even when the animal dehydrates, can drink as much as 400 gallons of water and\r\n                            26:31\r\n                            these cells will be in the same shape with all the water.\r\n                            26:37\r\n                            So, that's why God mentioned camel. That's also a scientific miracle, because they didn't know anything about the camel.\r\n                            26:50\r\n                            The only thing you know is that camel can go over the desert. But they didn't know so complex things about the camel at that time.\r\n                            27:05\r\n                            Any other comments? Edip, do you have a comment?\r\n                            27:38\r\n                            89. \"Dawn\" In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.\r\n                            27:45\r\n                            [89:1] By the dawn. [89:2] And the ten nights. * [89:3] By the even and the odd. * [89:4] By the night as it passes.\r\n                            27:52\r\n                            [89:5] A profound oath, for one who possesses intelligence. Again, we see here that the dawn, the ten nights, the even and the odd, by the night as it passes. These are all, this is a profound oath.\r\n                            28:06\r\n                            God is making an oath by all these things that He created.\r\n                            28:11\r\n                            But we know that the dawn is sure to come. I mean, every morning, it will never fail. It will come and sun will rise and then will set and come again.\r\n                            28:23\r\n                            That's one thing that we can take for granted that, you know, this is 5 o'clock tomorrow morning, the sun will rise.\r\n                            28:31\r\n                            And during the winter months it's probably 7 o'clock. People have means to calculate that by now.\r\n                            28:41\r\n                            The ten nights, these are the last ten nights of Ramadan as we see in the footnote,\r\n                            28:46\r\n                            wherein many believers retreat to the mosque. Sura 2, verse 187.\r\n                            28:59\r\n                            These are, you know, in Sura Al-Baqarah. These are, of course, that talks about the fasting that is instituted\r\n                            29:07\r\n                            by God since Abraham, then, we find in the Quran to allow intercourse between the spouse during the night of Ramadan,\r\n                            29:17\r\n                            except when one decides to retreat to the mosque during the last ten days of Ramadan.\r\n                            29:23\r\n                            So, we know that the ten nights is the last ten nights of Ramadan.\r\n                            29:29\r\n                            The even and the odd, we are talking here about mathematics as we know the proof that God\r\n                            29:35\r\n                            has chosen to use to prove His word is through mathematics.\r\n                            29:40\r\n                            Even and odds are numbers. We are talking about the numbers. And number 19 is the number that proves that the Quran is the word of God.\r\n                            29:49\r\n                            And therefore, the oath by this, even and the odd, these are all numbers that constitute\r\n                            29:56\r\n                            you know, mathematical structure and composition of the Quran.\r\n                            30:03\r\n                            Indeed, this is an awesome oath. [89:4] By the night as it passes. So, we know why this is a profound oath.\r\n                            30:12\r\n                            God says that for people who possess intelligence, people who dare to use their thinking to think about the Creator\r\n                            30:21\r\n                            and find that there is a profound proof behind it. Then, these are people who possess intelligence.\r\n                            30:28\r\n                            [89:6] Have you noted what your Lord did to 'Ãd? [89:7] Erum; the town with tall buildings.\r\n                            30:34\r\n                            [89:8] There was nothing like it anywhere. Number 9, [89:9] Also Thamûd, who carved the rocks in their valley.\r\n                            30:41\r\n                            [89:10] And Pharaoh who possessed might. [89:11] They all transgressed in the land. [89:12] They spread evil throughout.\r\n                            30:48\r\n                            [89:13] Consequently, your Lord poured upon them a whipping retribution. [89:14] Your Lord is ever watchful.\r\n                            30:55\r\n                            15, [89:15] When the human being is tested by his Lord, through blessings and joy, he says, \"My Lord is generous towards me.\"\r\n                            31:02\r\n                            [89:16] But if He tests him through reduction in provisions, he says, \"My Lord is humiliating me!\"\r\n                            31:08\r\n                            [89:17] Wrong! It is you who brought it on yourselves by not regarding the orphan. [89:18] And not advocating charity towards the poor.\r\n                            31:16\r\n                            19, [89:19] And consuming the inheritance of helpless orphans. [89:20] And loving the money too much.\r\n                            31:25\r\n                            So, we've seen here the history of the previous generations, what they did and what the consequences that they received from God.\r\n                            31:38\r\n                            One thing that is interesting to me is, Pharaoh is mentioned in the Quran many times.\r\n                            31:44\r\n                            But I think, I haven't done a serious research on this, but I think 'Ãd and Thamoud is mentioned very often.\r\n                            31:50\r\n                            Almost, you know, every time there is a mention of the previous generation, there is 'Ãd and Thamoud. And we also know for instance Sodom and Gomorrah, you know, the people of Lot.\r\n                            32:01\r\n                            They're also mentioned in the Quran but not as often. And I used to wonder about that. And I see that probably, you know, what we see around us happening, you know, tornado, flood, or...\r\n                            32:16\r\n                            these are all that happens to, you know, the people of, you know, 'Ãd and Thamoud, earthquakes.\r\n                            32:22\r\n                            Something that happens very often that most people don't think anymore as God's retribution. They think this is a natural phenomenon.\r\n                            32:29\r\n                            People don't see the parting of the Red Sea anymore, or the city turned upside down.\r\n                            32:35\r\n                            But people see tornadoes. People see floods, earthquakes. And I wonder whether that is probably connected to why 'Ãd and Thamoud is mentioned more often than others.\r\n                            32:45\r\n                            Because these are something that, to us, it is the action of God.\r\n                            32:50\r\n                            And things that happens not without any cause, there is.... whether that is probably connected to why 'Ãd and Thamoud is mentioned more often than others.\r\n                            32:59\r\n                            Because these are something that, to us, it is the action of God. And things that happens not without any cause,\r\n                            33:07\r\n                            there is something behind it, why the earthquake happens in the place where the majority of people are idol worshippers.\r\n                            33:14\r\n                            I mean, people who are killed in the earthquakes, if we record the number of earthquakes, I have a book.\r\n                            33:20\r\n                            How many people killed in this earthquake, in that place. Either they don't believe in God or they are idol worshippers.\r\n                            33:26\r\n                            So, that seems to me a reminder that, you know, don't take it for granted. This is a punishment from God.\r\n                            33:33\r\n                            Most people don't believe it, but it is. Also, tornadoes and these are things that happened to 'Ãd and Thamoud.\r\n                            33:50\r\n                            A man: Number 15, and 16, and 17, and on up to number 20 is....\r\n                            33:58\r\n                            A woman: It is better when it says \"in every situation there is relief.\" It is a little softer than \"with pain, there is gain.\" However,...\r\n                            We must give God’s commandments priority – everything else is a “waste of time”. Happiness explained.\r\n                            34:06\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: I think this is the effect of the gymnasium. A woman: Yeah, \"no pain, no gain.\" Dr. Khalifa: They have a big sign there. Everybody look to \"No pain, no gain.\"\r\n                            34:16\r\n                            I can see it now. They affected me.\r\n                            34:22\r\n                            A woman: I'll always, I have to confess, think of it as with difficulty there is relief. Dr. Khalifa: That has to be true, though.\r\n                            34:27\r\n                            For example, you mentioned the mosquitoes that (unintelligible). us in San Francisco.\r\n                            34:33\r\n                            And this happens to be one of the most memorable things that happened because many...\r\n                            34:38\r\n                            A woman: (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Number 7 is telling you, you must grab every chance you can get to heal your soul.\r\n                            34:45\r\n                            Every chance that has to do with God, you must grab it. You must remember that anything you do in this world that has nothing to do with God is a waste of life.\r\n                            34:55\r\n                            It is a terrible waste of time. We do it only out of necessity. The reason we go to work is to make a living.\r\n                            35:02\r\n                            But if there is anything that has to do, that does not have to do with God, it's a waste of time.\r\n                            35:07\r\n                            So number 7 here, [94:7] Whenever possible you shall strive. It means you must never pass up a chance that you'll strive in the cause of God,\r\n                            35:17\r\n                            a Friday Prayer, a lesson, a meeting, a Quranic study.\r\n                            35:23\r\n                            This is God's advice to you and me. [94:7] Whenever possible you shall strive.\r\n                            35:29\r\n                            You must give God's commandments priority over anything else.\r\n                            35:35\r\n                            Then, if you have time, you do the other things, go to work, make a living.\r\n                            35:42\r\n                            And God guarantees that you'll make more money if you give up... If you give up an hour of work, for example, for the sake of Friday Prayer,\r\n                            35:50\r\n                            God guarantees it in the Quran that if you give up, you'll make more money. So, it should be a material gain as well as spiritual gain.\r\n                            36:00\r\n                            God is the only One who dispenses provisions.\r\n                            36:05\r\n                            [94:7] Whenever possible you shall strive. [94:8] Seeking only your Lord.\r\n                            36:12\r\n                            Fortunately, we are the people who hear this advice. It's other people who need this advice.\r\n                            36:18\r\n                            Because we automatically do this. Alhamdu Lillah. ‘Alaykum Al-Salaam.\r\n                            36:24\r\n                            We have three profound introductions. The day and the night are profound signs, as you know.\r\n                            36:34\r\n                            They remind us that the earth is hanging in space. And the male and the female.\r\n                            36:41\r\n                            So, these three profound verses tell us that... actually this short Sura tells the secrets of happiness.\r\n                            36:48\r\n                            So, it is very important to know which path will lead you to happiness in this world and forever,\r\n                            36:54\r\n                            and which path will lead you to misery in this world and forever. So, you see in verse 7, the path to happiness... in Sura 54, if you remember, God says \"He directs you to happiness and misery.\"\r\n                            37:09\r\n                            He controls that. And it is now established that mere success does not bring happiness.\r\n                            37:16\r\n                            So, your works are of various kinds, and they will lead you to either path, happiness or misery.\r\n                            37:25\r\n                            And what I wanted to emphasize is verses 5 and 18. Both of them talk about charity.\r\n                            37:33\r\n                            In this short Sura, two verses talk about charity. It's because it's a continuous process.\r\n                            37:41\r\n                            Just like we feed, God wants to remind us that just because we continuously feed our body... how many times did we drink today?\r\n                            37:48\r\n                            You drank water or coke or something today. You drank. You ate.\r\n                            37:54\r\n                            You really take care of your body, your garment. So, God is reminding us to take care of the real person, of you.\r\n                            38:03\r\n                            To take care of you is a continuous process, just like the eating and the drinking and the sleeping, and the showering, the things that you do for your body.\r\n                            38:12\r\n                            It is a continuous process and like the Five Contact Prayers, continuous process.\r\n                            38:19\r\n                            Charity also is a continuous process because you continuously make money.\r\n                            38:24\r\n                            And you have to set aside 2.5% for your relatives, your parents, and so on.\r\n                            38:31\r\n                            (unintelligible). The three verses, three profound signs. This is common in the short Suras.\r\n                            38:40\r\n                            Receive something that's very important. And here the important thing is the secret of happiness.\r\n                            38:48\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: If you do these continuous processes, that develop your soul, God promises you happiness now and forever.\r\n                            38:56\r\n                            Edip: So, these three verses are consistent, but in 8, God says in the fourth verse, [92:4] Your works are of various kinds.\r\n                            39:05\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible) Edip: Yes, because (unintelligible) from our life, a good life, and then you are (unintelligible).\r\n                            39:22\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: I think we're getting... I remind myself. I need to remind myself not to be lax in doing it.\r\n                            39:32\r\n                            Every time I receive money, I just have to cut out 2.5%. It's a very good investment.\r\n                            39:38\r\n                            But the reason God repeats it is because God knows that we tend to forget or neglect to do it.\r\n                            39:48\r\n                            We seem to do the Five daily Prayers easily. But charity is something that we tend to forget because we get involved in spending all the money we've got.\r\n                            39:59\r\n                            We didn't set aside the 2.5%.\r\n                            Professional beggars. Do not reprimand the beggar. Charitable Organizations.\r\n                            40:06\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: So, the reason this is... also repetition is psychologically important.\r\n                            40:14\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: This is a comment. Because God knows the human beings (unintelligible) Praying (unintelligible).\r\n                            40:24\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Circumstances. A man: Yeah. Dr. Khalifa: Sometimes when able-bodied people with perfect qualifications, somehow they just go weeks, maybe months without, without a job.\r\n                            40:37\r\n                            It doesn't seem to be able...\r\n                            40:45\r\n                            You have to be extremely kind to them. There may be exceptions.\r\n                            40:51\r\n                            Some professional beggars (unintelligible).\r\n                            41:07\r\n                            Different issue. Maybe. You have to use discretion, except remember, you cannot be suspicious.\r\n                            41:14\r\n                            Then, you have to know.\r\n                            41:34\r\n                            Tucson is the food bank.\r\n                            41:39\r\n                            In Tucson, there's a food bank. But, sometimes you meet these people in the street. They come to your door.\r\n                            41:46\r\n                            You have to act. There's a commandment here not to recommend the beggar. So, you'd better be careful. I'd rather be a (unintelligible) than breaking a commandment.\r\n                            42:01\r\n                            Right. Right. I mean, this is the least... The least you can do is not reprimand the person\r\n                            42:08\r\n                            Because, unless you know personally what he or she is doing.\r\n                            42:15\r\n                            You have to start with the surroundings though. So, your parents, your relatives. And if there's somebody here at the mosque that need it, that will, you take priority over...\r\n                            42:25\r\n                            A children's organization probably takes a lot of money from United Way.\r\n                            42:30\r\n                            And they have a lot of professionals living off of that, too. I investigate. I find that the food bank is very clean.\r\n                            42:38\r\n                            They don't have (unintelligible), organizers. And they really do give food to the poor. So, this is...\r\n                            42:45\r\n                            But there are some other organizations that take millions of dollars that goes to the children, abused, to the battered wives, abused, this and that.\r\n                            42:53\r\n                            United Way pays the millions of dollars. And there are organizers and administrators who take up to 90% of that money.\r\n                            43:00\r\n                            (Unintelligible). So, you're paying salaries.\r\n                            43:11\r\n                            (unintelligible) A woman: There's nothing wrong with giving that, if you don't use it as, like, over and above Zakat to any of those things.\r\n                            43:18\r\n                            Because I give to a lot of animal organizations. But I don't count that as Zakat. Dr. Khalifa: But the system of the Quran is, you start with your own family. Then, you go further and further.\r\n                            43:27\r\n                            Priorities are stated in the Quran. It is something that...\r\n                            43:40\r\n                            This is your family...\r\n                            43:49\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Ok. I'm glad you brought this up. Some people think that this was directed to Muhammad personally.\r\n                            43:55\r\n                            Because of \"your Lord will give you...\" [93:7] He found you astray, and He guided you.\r\n                            Verses explained “we found you astray”.\r\n                            44:03\r\n                            You will not get the Mohammedans to confess that he ever was astray.\r\n                            44:11\r\n                            Ahmad Rayan is laughing because I had my father, he was for 4 months here and I wanted him to say it\r\n                            44:19\r\n                            \"Muhammad was astray\" and he wouldn't say it. We had a lot of funny encounters.\r\n                            44:26\r\n                            Because when I showed him all the other verses showing that Muhammad did make mistakes, he would say \"ok\"\r\n                            44:32\r\n                            \"So, he was astray.\" And then five minutes later he changed his mind. So, we...\r\n                            44:40\r\n                            The way he said \"ok, he was astray, but became a...\" Something with (unintelligible) I remember.\r\n                            44:48\r\n                            But anyway, \"He found you\" and they will not agree that he was astray.\r\n                            44:54\r\n                            So, I chose to make the translation general. [93:8] He found you poor, and He made you rich.\r\n                            45:02\r\n                            Because it's applicable for everybody. If they want to apply it... Ironically, most of them, almost all of them, apply to Muhammad but they will not accept verse 7.\r\n                            45:15\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: In almost all the Tafseers and interpretations, they interpret this Sura as if God is talking to Muhammad only person.\r\n                            45:21\r\n                            Edip: They misinterpret this verse. Verse 7 is a problem, a very big problem for them. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            45:28\r\n                            Edip: Because their eyes have become (unintelligible) Prophethood (unintelligible).\r\n                            45:35\r\n                            And then they want to interpret... one of the most famous interpretations is, when he was a child, he lost his way, God showed him his way.\r\n                            45:46\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible). Dr. Sabahi: That's exactly what Rashad said that he was poor and God made him rich. That's exactly what it says.\r\n                            45:56\r\n                            Edip: (93:7) وَوَجَدَكَ ضَآلًّۭا فَهَدَىٰ They say \"God lost his weight when he was a child.\"\r\n                            46:09\r\n                            I'll say a very short translation. This is the reason. Dr. Sabahi: No.\r\n                            46:16\r\n                            A woman: Also, you know, all of us will be orphans at one time or another, unless we die before our parents do.\r\n                            46:23\r\n                            But God always provides the home.\r\n                            46:31\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: It can't apply to everyone. Most of the next Sura will do the same thing.\r\n                            46:37\r\n                            But it can't apply to everyone because...\r\n                            46:50\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: We were excitable and glorious (unintelligible).\r\n                            46:56\r\n                            Just when you believe, then you put your trust in God. When you submit, submit to God.\r\n                            47:01\r\n                            As submitters, we realize that God knows what is best for us, and we put everything in God's hands. So, we don't worry anymore.\r\n                            47:08\r\n                            And you (unintelligible). You find that it is not worth it to get angry.\r\n                            47:15\r\n                            There's nothing in this world that is worth getting angry at.\r\n                            47:22\r\n                            So, this can be also general. So, we go to Catherine and Sura 94.\r\n                            47:29\r\n                            Catherine: In the name....\r\n                            47:36\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ We seek refuge in God from Satan, the rejected.\r\n                            47:44\r\n                            Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. Tonight, we start at Sura 81.\r\n                            47:51\r\n                            And our teacher is Edip. He's gonna start right away. Go ahead.\r\n                            47:57\r\n                            Edip: Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem [81:1] When the sun is rolled. [81:2] The stars are crashed into each other. [81:3] The mountains are wiped out.\r\n                            48:10\r\n                            [81:4] The reproduction is halted. [81:5] The beasts are summoned. [81:6] The oceans are set aflame.\r\n                            48:18\r\n                            [81:7] The souls are restored to their bodies. [81:8] The girl who was buried alive is asked: [81:9] For what crime was she killed?\r\n                            48:29\r\n                            [81:10] The records are made known. [81:11] The heaven is removed. [81:12] Hell is ignited.\r\n                            48:36\r\n                            [81:13] Paradise is presented. [81:14] Every soul will know everything it brought.\r\n                            48:47\r\n                            Here, there is a general description of end of the world and resurrection.\r\n                            48:54\r\n                            But I think there is no sequence between these events.\r\n                            Dr. Rashad Khalifa states IMPLOSION of the universe due to God coming to our Universe.\r\n                            49:00\r\n                            Only description of both events.\r\n                            49:17\r\n                            God's Messenger of the Covenant Edip: [81:15] I solemnly..... Dr. Khalifa: Wait wait, you wanna explain the stars crashing into each other?\r\n                            49:31\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: We can read it. Edip: Yes, I know, but it is so obvious. What can I say?\r\n                            49:38\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: [81:3] The mountains are wiped out. Edip: Yes, because the harmony, the system will be collapsed. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            49:45\r\n                            Edip: And there will be no gravitation. There will be no any system.\r\n                            49:52\r\n                            And everything will collapse, will crash each other.\r\n                            49:58\r\n                            And these are descriptions of end of the world. Edip: Very obvious.\r\n                            50:05\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: So, there'll be an implosion. Edip: What?\r\n                            50:11\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: There will be an implosion. That sounds like it. The stars will crash into each other.\r\n                            50:18\r\n                            Edip: Do you remember... Dr. Khalifa: I don't wanna give you a rough time. Edip: No, no, no, I don't worry about that.\r\n                            50:23\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Ok. Good. Dr. Khalifa: Ok. In Sura 39, it says \"we're gonna fold the heavens like folding a book.\" Edip: Yes. Yes.\r\n                            50:30\r\n                            Edip: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: This is it. Dr. Khalifa: So, it's an implosion, that they actually are expecting an implosion.\r\n                            50:35\r\n                            Edip: There are two theories about end of this universe, scientific theories.\r\n                            50:41\r\n                            According to them, one option, the universe is expanding.\r\n                            50:48\r\n                            If the expanse speed is more than a critical point, the universe cannot come together.\r\n                            50:58\r\n                            (unintelligible) Forever, it will expand and...\r\n                            51:06\r\n                            But another theory is, the maximum speed is below the critical point, and then after a while,\r\n                            51:18\r\n                            many years later, they say thousands years or billions years later, they will come together.\r\n                            51:27\r\n                            For example, if you threw a stone from the earth, more than 11 km per second, if its speed\r\n                            51:39\r\n                            11 km, more than 11 km per second, this stone will not come back to the earth. Dr. Khalifa: Exit...\r\n                            51:50\r\n                            Edip: But if the speed of the stone is less than 11 km per second, it will come back many kilometers later,\r\n                            51:59\r\n                            it will stop and then will fall on the earth. This is Gravity law.\r\n                            52:06\r\n                            And now from Quran, we understand, we know, that the second theory will occur.\r\n                            52:15\r\n                            This theory is called as... What is the opposite of open?\r\n                            52:23\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Implode. Edip: Implodes. Yes. Universe Theory.\r\n                            52:29\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: But what is the Quran's theory? Edip: Quran's theory is implosion.\r\n                            52:34\r\n                            They will come together like the paper of the book. And yes, this is the description of implosion.\r\n                            52:42\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Why will it happen? Edip: Creation was explosion. Edip: What? Dr. Khalifa: Why will the implosion happen?\r\n                            52:48\r\n                            Edip: Because God will say \"be\" and it will be.\r\n                            52:53\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, it's not just that. Anybody wants...?\r\n                            53:00\r\n                            (unintelligible) Yeah? Emily. Emily: Cause... Edip: God will come. Dr. Khalifa: Yes, there you go.\r\n                            53:10\r\n                            You have to speak fast, yeah? Okay, now. So, now, we're talking. Dr. Khalifa: So, this implosion will happen because God will physically come to this universe.\r\n                            53:19\r\n                            Edip: God's physical existence, when God comes, this universe cannot stand for God's physical existence, then they will explode... implode.\r\n                            53:37\r\n                            Do you have any question about this part? Edip: If you ask, we can explain.\r\n                            53:45\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Why? It's like pulling teeth, you know? It's got the information there, but you have to pull it out. Edip: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: So, do ask him questions.\r\n                            53:52\r\n                            Beth: I have a question. What about verse 8 and 9?\r\n                            53:58\r\n                            Edip: [81:8] The girl who was buried alive is asked: [81:9] For what crime was she killed?\r\n                            54:03\r\n                            From Quran, we learn that Arabs, they were humiliating women, and they were not glad with the girls.\r\n                            54:14\r\n                            When they see girl as a baby, they didn't want girls, and they were killing them.\r\n                            54:23\r\n                            And this was a very great crime, offense. And also now we can see the extension of this understanding.\r\n                            54:38\r\n                            In many places in the world, girls are also the second, girls are the second class of human beings.\r\n                            54:51\r\n                            And I think killing of girls was because of economy.\r\n                            55:00\r\n                            Boys, when they become adults, they could gain money or they could work, but girls at that time, they couldn't do.\r\n                            55:14\r\n                            And this was one of the reasons.\r\n                            55:21\r\n                            What? Yes.\r\n                            55:27\r\n                            Edip: summoned, but these are... Dr. Khalifa: (81:5) وَإِذَا ٱلْوُحُوشُ حُشِرَتْ Edip: (81:5) وَإِذَا ٱلْوُحُوشُ حُشِرَتْ\r\n                            55:40\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: He's waiting. Edip: Yes. Edip: What's your question, brother?\r\n                            55:47\r\n                            Why? A man: Are the beasts called (unintelligible)?\r\n                            55:53\r\n                            A man: They are called (unintelligible). A man: What does that refer to?\r\n                            55:58\r\n                            Edip: There are two ways to interpret, to understand this. One way, the beasts, when a big event, explosion, or a great shock happens, from fear they come together.\r\n                            All animals resurrected – “you will meet your pet”. Black holes are similar representations of End of the universe.\r\n                            56:14\r\n                            They will come together. This may be expression of this event.\r\n                            56:19\r\n                            Or in Hereafter, God also will resurrect all animals.\r\n                            56:27\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: The second interpretation is correct. Because in Sura 6, verse 38, you can see that that, remember?\r\n                            56:34\r\n                            (6:38) ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يُحْشَرُونَ Edip: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: So, it's the same word being used, that all the animals will be resurrected and will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection.\r\n                            56:43\r\n                            A man: I also have a comment. So, if you had a pet or anything, you will meet them all on the Day of Judgement.\r\n                            56:49\r\n                            A man: I have a comment which I'm not sure is accurate because the earth is (unintelligible).\r\n                            57:00\r\n                            Verse 2, verses are very similar also to describe the black hole phenomenon where a star changes its size very quickly\r\n                            57:12\r\n                            and then shrinks in a gravitational (unintelligible).\r\n                            57:17\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, the black hole phenomenon is a minute representation of this. This is a universal black hole.\r\n                            57:25\r\n                            It's similar to it. But I wanna go back to the 8 and 9 that Beth was asking about.\r\n                            57:32\r\n                            I don't like to depress you, but this is actually still happening in Saudi Arabia today.\r\n                            57:45\r\n                            I call it a cultural disaster. And this is why when they walk into this mosque, they are shocked to see a woman's hair.\r\n                            57:54\r\n                            And they run away. I mean, they cover up the woman, and they regard them in such a disastrous way that\r\n                            Lies attributed to Masjid Tucson “men and woman pray side by side” or “woman lead the prayer”. Should be no preference for boy or girl when having children.\r\n                            58:03\r\n                            they used to kill the baby girls in the past. And I had a Saudi friend 10 years ago who went back to Saudi Arabia, and he came back.\r\n                            58:14\r\n                            He was almost crying. He said \"you can find baby girls in garbage bins now.\"\r\n                            58:21\r\n                            He was from Medina. He said \"this is in the prophet's city.\"\r\n                            58:27\r\n                            It's very depressing. This is what I call... I mean, how will you change a cultural behavior like that?\r\n                            58:35\r\n                            If the Quran didn't do it, what is going to do it? But this will, this will make you understand why they are shocked when they walk in here.\r\n                            58:46\r\n                            And they make up stories like \"in Masjid Tucson, the men and the women pray side by side,\" which is not true.\r\n                            58:52\r\n                            And they make up things like \"women lead the prayer in Masjid Tucson. It's just they have this severe complex.\r\n                            59:03\r\n                            But even today, these things happen. They don't have accurate records of pregnancies or even births in Saudi Arabia.\r\n                            59:13\r\n                            So, this is why it is significant that it is mentioned.\r\n                            59:20\r\n                            And this was mentioned in other places in the Quran. [81:8] The girl who was buried alive is asked: [81:9] For what crime was she killed?\r\n                            59:30\r\n                            And of course the hint is for those who commit this horrendous crime.\r\n                            59:36\r\n                            It's a demonstration of stupidity.\r\n                            59:43\r\n                            So, believers don't have that.\r\n                            59:48\r\n                            I come across believers once in a while who prefer to have a son over a daughter.\r\n                            59:55\r\n                            And I really sock it to them when they come up with that. Because there is no preference whatsoever, I mean, as far as God is concerned.\r\n                            1:00:08\r\n                            It may even be the other way around. In fact, there are sayings, I think here in the States maybe, even other countries also,\r\n                            1:00:20\r\n                            that say \"the girl brings a son, but the son is taken away by his wife.\" Something to that effect.\r\n                            1:00:30\r\n                            A woman: \"When your son marries, you lose a son. When Your daughter marries, you gain a son.\" Dr. Khalifa: Right, something like that. I've heard it in different ways, said in different ways.\r\n                            1:00:40\r\n                            So,...\r\n                            1:00:47\r\n                            Right. Yes. He should be brought out.\r\n                            1:00:57\r\n                            It's such a horrendous crime that the Quran gives it a lot of attention. It also reflects the kind of mentality that exists there, even now.\r\n                            Forced dress code is similar to burying an infant alive. Oppression of woman.\r\n                            1:01:10\r\n                            Any comments, Lisa?\r\n                            1:01:16\r\n                            Exactly, yes, exactly. I'm glad you mentioned that. Yeah, even the women who survive, they're actually buried alive, the way they demand that they're covered up this way.\r\n                            1:01:30\r\n                            Ismail just came from Iran. And how does the streets look like?\r\n                            1:01:35\r\n                            The ladies, they have to be covered up.\r\n                            1:01:41\r\n                            How is the society in general accepting this? Is there any kind of rebellion among some people?\r\n                            1:01:48\r\n                            Ismail: No, there are some women who have been killed in the same way.\r\n                            1:01:56\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Is it a widespread rebellion or is it limited? Are the people accepting it?\r\n                            1:02:01\r\n                            Like just take the ladies who used to walk in the streets in European clothes. Now, they have to cover up in this black stuff.\r\n                            1:02:10\r\n                            So, they are... They're forced, because otherwise they'll be killed.\r\n                            1:02:16\r\n                            So, did you hear over there? Ismail says that there is rebellion against this forced dress in Iran, but they can do nothing about it. If they speak up, they'll be killed.\r\n                            1:02:29\r\n                            So, it is a terrible oppression. This is a form of burial. They're being buried alive.\r\n                            1:02:38\r\n                            What's her name? 60 Minutes. What's her name? Diane Sawyer? Diane Sawyer went to Iran, and she had to, before the plane landed in Iran, she had to cover up her head, and she made a big deal out of this.\r\n                            1:02:55\r\n                            It's a double standard. Go ahead, Douglas.\r\n                            1:03:03\r\n                            Douglas: I was shocked to find out even today, that some of the so-called Muslim countries, as far as I can tell, just out of sheer suspicion of people who would throw their daughter out of the house,\r\n                            1:03:14\r\n                            and (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:03:19\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Oh, yeah. Of daughters. Douglas: Can you try to rationalize the takeover of all the property, or how you're going to get the property to take their lives?\r\n                            1:03:29\r\n                            There are a few incidents of this type that might happen, where the husband would say\r\n                            1:03:36\r\n                            \"I don't want you to do something wrong with me, and murder his wife, or throw her out, or kill his daughter.\"\r\n                            1:03:45\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Well, I have on my desk a piece of news from the Arizona newspaper,\r\n                            1:03:50\r\n                            where in Iran they ordered... No, no, excuse me. In Pakistan, a judge ordered the execution of six people, because of sex crimes.\r\n                            1:04:00\r\n                            This is the headline. And when you read the article, you find out that this lady didn't like her husband, so she left him.\r\n                            1:04:09\r\n                            Of course, according to the Quran, marriage is a contract between two people, and once out, the contract is invalid anymore.\r\n                            1:04:18\r\n                            But they don't give this right to the woman, according to the so-called Islamic Shari'a.\r\n                            1:04:23\r\n                            So, I don't know how many months or years later, she married somebody else.\r\n                            1:04:31\r\n                            Now, her former husband complained, and they ruled that she and her new husband have committed adultery.\r\n                            1:04:43\r\n                            So, the judge ordered them stoned to death. And four of their friends were also stoned to death, because they knew about it.\r\n                            1:04:55\r\n                            I have this on my desk. If you don't believe it, you can read it later. This is the kind of mentality that is...\r\n                            1:05:04\r\n                            where their women are oppressed.\r\n                            1:05:16\r\n                            And we read in Sura 28 that God feels for the oppressed, and He makes it up to them.\r\n                            1:05:21\r\n                            According to Hadith and Sunnah, the majority of inhabitants of Hell are women. But I'm convinced that the opposite is true, because of the oppression that they undergo.\r\n                            1:05:34\r\n                            When I served in Saudi Arabia for the United Nations, I came across a daily program\r\n                            1:05:42\r\n                            where people send messages, and most of these messages were from women.\r\n                            1:05:48\r\n                            I'm telling you, I cried. I actually cried listening to that program. Because a typical story will be a woman whose husband disappeared for six months or a year.\r\n                            1:05:59\r\n                            She doesn't know where he is. She's grounded in the apartment or the house or the place that's assigned for her.\r\n                            Dr. Rashad Khalifa thanks God for the freedom in America to practise following Quran alone.\r\n                            1:06:05\r\n                            And her in-laws bring whatever food or whatever that keeps her alive. She never leaves the place. It's just like a prison.\r\n                            1:06:13\r\n                            And this is a typical story. And she's asking for help.\r\n                            1:06:18\r\n                            Obviously she snuck out a letter to that radio program.\r\n                            1:06:25\r\n                            So, it is a tragic situation. And... I guess abandoning the Quran is one of the reasons for this happening.\r\n                            1:06:36\r\n                            Any other comments or questions? I just want you know what is happening over there so we can thank God for the freedom we have here and the ability to practice the Quran.\r\n                            1:06:48\r\n                            Edip, Back to Edip. Dr. Khalifa: Verse 15? Edip: Yes, verse 15.\r\n                            1:06:54\r\n                            God's Messenger of the Covenant [81:15] I solemnly swear by the galaxies. [81:16] Precisely running in their orbits. [81:17] By the night as it falls.\r\n                            1:07:04\r\n                            [81:18] And the morning as it breathes. [81:19] This is the utterance of an honorable messenger. *\r\n                            1:07:11\r\n                            [81:20] Authorized by the Possessor of the Throne, fully supported. [81:21] He shall be obeyed and trusted. [81:22] Your friend (Rashad) is not crazy.\r\n                            1:07:21\r\n                            [81:23] He saw him at the high horizon. * [81:24] He is not holding back any news. [81:25] It is not the talk of a rejected devil. [81:26] Now then, where will you go?\r\n                            1:07:32\r\n                            [81:27] This is a message to all the people. [81:28] For those who wish to go straight. [81:29] Whatever you will is in accordance with the will of GOD, Lord of the universe.\r\n                            1:07:52\r\n                            Look at the footnotes, at the footnote. If you add the number of the chapter plus Rashad, gematrical value of Rashad and Khalifa\r\n                            1:08:04\r\n                            you'll find it divisible by 19.\r\n                            1:08:09\r\n                            And this refers to the message because in verse 27, God says\r\n                            1:08:21\r\n                            (81:27) إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا ذِكْرٌۭ لِّلْعَـٰلَمِينَ [81:27] This is a message to all the people.\r\n                            1:08:32\r\n                            And it describes Rashad's experience, how many years ago?\r\n                            1:08:40\r\n                            Edip: 20 years ago. Dr. Khalifa: 1971. Edip: In 1971, when he was in Mecca, he had an experience, a visual experience and this is a description of this event.\r\n                            1:08:55\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Thank you. If you refer to this Appendix 2. That's 643. Edip: In Appendix 2, there's a reference. I... you have now.\r\n                            Talks about being Dr. Rashad Khalifa. Talks about “why Authorized” translation of the Quran.\r\n                            1:09:09\r\n                            Now, in chapter 3, verse 81, you will see the prophecy about God's Messenger of the Covenant.\r\n                            1:09:22\r\n                            And if you add them to the gematrical value of Rashad and Khalifa, you will find 1311, which is multiple of 19.\r\n                            1:09:32\r\n                            And this is... this Sura has number of 81.\r\n                            1:09:37\r\n                            And you'll find in verse 19, God describes the messenger.\r\n                            1:09:48\r\n                            And also, if you add them up, it is also divisible by 19.\r\n                            1:09:58\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: This is, of course, very embarrassing to me, but I can't afford to hold back any of this.\r\n                            1:10:04\r\n                            It's mainly for the future generation. Our generation is... may not be able to stand this kind of news.\r\n                            1:10:15\r\n                            As for our people, God snuck it on us gradually, very slowly. So, we are able to stand it.\r\n                            1:10:21\r\n                            But it really is an awesome responsibility.\r\n                            1:10:28\r\n                            I wanna read with you page 643. Why 81?\r\n                            1:10:35\r\n                            I want to spare Edip the shyness.\r\n                            1:10:41\r\n                            Verse 81 and Sura 81. Number 16 here says \"God's Messeger of the Covenant is prophesied in verse 81 of Sura 3.\r\n                            1:10:48\r\n                            The addition of the gematrical value of Rashad, which is 505, plus the gematrical value of Khalifa, which is 725, plus the verse number 81, produces a total of 1311, 19 x 69.\r\n                            1:11:01\r\n                            Number 17, if you look at Sura 81, which is what we're studying tonight, we read about a messenger of God who is powerfully supported and authorized by the Almighty, as we see in verse 19.\r\n                            1:11:12\r\n                            Thus, verse 81 of Sura 3 and Sura 81, verse 19, are strongly connected with the name Rashad Khalifa.\"\r\n                            1:11:23\r\n                            As you know, when the first hint came out in the first translation, Authorized English Version, a lot of people were up in arms, you know.\r\n                            1:11:30\r\n                            \"Why authorized? Who authorized this?\" But the verse in Arabic here, verse 20, is very clear.\r\n                            1:11:38\r\n                            [81:20] Authorized by the Possessor of the Throne, fully supported. And now we have these mathematical proofs, Quranic and mathematical.\r\n                            1:11:50\r\n                            Number 18, on page 643, says \"if we add the Sura numbers plus the number of verses from the beginning of the Quran\r\n                            1:11:57\r\n                            to verse 3:81, where the Messenger of the Covenant is prophesied, the total comes to 380, 19 times 20.\r\n                            1:12:05\r\n                            And this is shown in table 6.\" You understand this number 18?\r\n                            1:12:10\r\n                            You take the Sura numbers and the number of verses from the beginning of the Quran to the\r\n                            1:12:17\r\n                            to the place where the Messenger of the covenant is prophesied. And this gives us 380, a multiple of 19.\r\n                            1:12:23\r\n                            And as you know, 19 is our generation's sign.\r\n                            1:12:29\r\n                            Number 19 says \"the gematrical value of verse 3:81 is 13148, which is a multiple of 19.\r\n                            1:12:36\r\n                            This value is obtained by adding the gematrical values of every letter in the verse.\"\r\n                            1:12:41\r\n                            Number 20, \"if you look at that portion of verse 3:81, which refers specifically to the Messenger of the Covenant,\"\r\n                            1:12:48\r\n                            I have it here in Arabic, it says \"a messenger will come to you confirming what you have,\"\r\n                            1:12:53\r\n                            we find that the gematrical value of this key phrase is 836, 19 x 44.\r\n                            1:13:01\r\n                            So, this is the connection with Sura 81.\r\n                            1:13:06\r\n                            This is why I couldn't afford to avoid writing in verse 22, put the name Rashad in parentheses there, verse 22.\r\n                            1:13:19\r\n                            And some of you who are familiar with the initial announcement will excuse me for doing this\r\n                            1:13:26\r\n                            because I just can't afford to hold back.\r\n                            1:13:32\r\n                            Those of you who are not familiar with that momentous night, I'll be glad to go over it with you again. And\r\n                            1:13:40\r\n                            if you find that this is not acceptable, I don't blame you. It is very difficult, very difficult to accept.\r\n                            1:13:47\r\n                            But I will be very happy to discuss it with you if you have any reservations.\r\n                            1:13:55\r\n                            Or like I said \"this is for the future generations.\" It'll be easier for them.\r\n                            (Banter) Kids tell neighbours “God’s messenger is sleeping at our house”. TRUST the Dr. Rashad Khalifa as God deliverer’s information via the Dr. Rashad Khalifa.\r\n                            1:14:01\r\n                            I have to share with you a story that will please the believers.\r\n                            1:14:09\r\n                            We were staying at Farima and Amir Kuleyni in San Francisco, and they have two children,\r\n                            1:14:15\r\n                            Shaliz, she is 8 years old, and Paris, he is 6 or 7.\r\n                            1:14:23\r\n                            After two days of staying there, the neighbor's kids came to the house and asked \"where is God's messenger?\"\r\n                            1:14:29\r\n                            Apparently, Farima and Amir's children were going to the neighbor's saying \"guess who's sleeping in our house?\"\r\n                            1:14:39\r\n                            And it reflected how it will be a lot easier for the new generation, because they don't have the holdbacks, or the hang-ups that we have.\r\n                            1:14:50\r\n                            They will grow up and they will look at the whole story objectively. They will look at the proofs objectively, without anything holding them back.\r\n                            1:15:00\r\n                            So, it pleases us to see the people, the new generation.\r\n                            1:15:05\r\n                            So this here, if you excuse me for putting it in, it is for the new generations.\r\n                            1:15:12\r\n                            And I hope most of you will understand anyway.\r\n                            1:15:17\r\n                            Ok, back to Edip. Edip: Do you have any questions about this part?\r\n                            1:15:24\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: If you have any questions, don't be shy, because you have to bring out any doubts and kill them.\r\n                            1:15:30\r\n                            Yes. It's interesting that I find some of these things happening without me paying attention, like\r\n                            1:15:39\r\n                            [81:24] He is not holding back any news. [81:24] He is not holding back any news.\r\n                            1:15:45\r\n                            because I'm not holding back anything. I want everything to be clear and open.\r\n                            1:15:50\r\n                            And then I read the verse and I say \"yeah, this is what is happening.\" And the point that Lisa raised of obey and trust,\r\n                            1:16:00\r\n                            [81:21] He shall be obeyed and trusted. It is not the person.\r\n                            1:16:06\r\n                            It's obey and trust because we're receiving information from God. And this is why God ties the commandment of \"obeying God and obeying the messenger\" together throughout the Quran.\r\n                            1:16:16\r\n                            Because I'm just as excited as you when we receive new information.\r\n                            1:16:24\r\n                            That straightened everything that we were doing. We were doing lots of things wrong and God's mercy sees to it that we changed our ways to the correct way.\r\n                            1:16:35\r\n                            So, this is where obeying and trusting comes. [81:22] Your friend (Rashad) is not crazy.\r\n                            1:16:42\r\n                            This ties in with the other statement of the Quran. It says \"I've lived with you many years.\"\r\n                            1:16:50\r\n                            In other words, this is a quotation in the Quran, do you remember it? I forget where it is exactly.\r\n                            1:16:56\r\n                            But what it says is that here's a person who has been with you for many years and you know he's not crazy.\r\n                            1:17:03\r\n                            Because a person who is not a messenger of God, who claims to be a messenger of God, will have to be crazy, if he's not a messenger.\r\n                            1:17:11\r\n                            It will be a person who has no belief that he will meet God someday and will be asked by God about everything he's doing.\r\n                            1:17:20\r\n                            Or he's a person who doesn't have any mental capacity whatsoever. And the statement that I've lived with you many years is because, you know, I got to know you. We know each other.\r\n                            1:17:32\r\n                            And obviously, I'm not crazy or mentally retarded or any....\r\n                            1:17:39\r\n                            So this statement, [81:22] Your friend (Rashad) is not crazy. is...ties in with that I stayed with you for a number of years. It is God's design\r\n                            1:17:48\r\n                            to appoint messengers after the age of 40. This has been consistent except for the Prophet Jesus for special reasons.\r\n                            1:17:58\r\n                            But every messenger was appointed after the age of 40. So, he lived among his people for 40 years. They knew him as a normal person who was a merchant or a shepherd or\r\n                            1:18:06\r\n                            going about his business. They know he's a normal person. All of a sudden, he says \"I'm God's messenger.\"\r\n                            1:18:12\r\n                            And invariably they accuse him of being crazy. So, he says \"I lived with you so many years and you didn't know that I was crazy. So, why do you call me crazy now?\"\r\n                            1:18:21\r\n                            You're going to examine what I am saying. Yes. 10:10?\r\n                            1:18:27\r\n                            10-16, yes. 10:16, yes. So, this is the idea.\r\n                            1:18:35\r\n                            Cause if you...If a person lives with you for so many years, you know him closely, and you know very well he's not crazy,\r\n                            1:18:44\r\n                            then he's either, he's really a God's messenger or he's a very very bad person who's trying to trick God.\r\n                            1:18:52\r\n                            It's one of the extremes. Nothing in between.\r\n                            1:19:00\r\n                            Yes. [81:23] He saw him at the high horizon. *\r\n                            1:19:05\r\n                            [81:23] He saw him at the high horizon. * The footnote 81:23 says \"Rashad Khalifa was summoned to the high horizon as detailed in Appendix 2.\r\n                            1:19:15\r\n                            And this has to do with the fact that I was summoned, and I was, I was passive at the time, but all the prophets\r\n                            1:19:24\r\n                            fulfilled their covenant, which is recognizing, acknowledging, supporting, and believing in the Messenger of the Covenant.\r\n                            1:19:35\r\n                            Yes, it was on the high horizon. Exactly where, I don't know, but it was out of this, out of this universe.\r\n                            1:19:44\r\n                            It was in the place where the souls are. Or chances are, it's in the seventh or the first universe.\r\n                            1:19:51\r\n                            If you consider ours the seventh universe, that fulfillment of the Covenant occurred in the first universe.\r\n                            1:19:58\r\n                            And in the last conference, as you know, I shared it with you in detail, and I'm glad to share it with anybody in detail at any time.\r\n                            1:20:07\r\n                            But most of you know, those of you who don't know it, I'll be glad to share it with you again.\r\n                            1:20:12\r\n                            But briefly, I was summoned to the first universe. I sat in a place, and all the prophets one by one acknowledged me as God's Messenger of the Covenant.\r\n                            1:20:24\r\n                            I was told they were all the prophets. I was not given the identity of any of them except Ibrahim, because of his resemblance to my own family.\r\n                            1:20:32\r\n                            I was taken aback by this man who looks like us, you know, my uncles, my father.\r\n                            1:20:38\r\n                            And I was told... there was no speaking at all. But mentally, I was told \"this is Abraham.\"\r\n                            1:20:44\r\n                            Other than that, I was told that these are all the prophets, that included Noah, Jesus, Moses, David, Solomon, all of them.\r\n                            1:20:53\r\n                            So, this is what 23 refers to. If you read the Appendix 2, it will give you these details.\r\n                            1:21:09\r\n                            Yeah. Where are the prophets now? Hold on.\r\n                            1:21:14\r\n                            See what happens...\r\n                            1:21:20\r\n                            Go ahead. He'll be alright though.\r\n                            1:21:33\r\n                            In other words, those who are known to deserve guidance will accept this information.\r\n                            1:21:41\r\n                            People who are willed by God to be guided.\r\n                            1:21:48\r\n                            Does this make sense, Martha? It should be clear. It says,\r\n                            1:21:54\r\n                            [81:27] This is a message to all the people. [81:28] For those who wish to go straight. You know, when you pray every day, you say,\r\n                            Every person has an invisible stamp “hell or heaven”. Cannot guide those who are stamped hell.\r\n                            1:22:00\r\n                            Ehdina Al-Serata Al-Mustaqeem (1:6) Guide us on the straight path, or the right path. So, those who wish to go straight will accept this heavy information. This is very heavy information.\r\n                            1:22:16\r\n                            Okay, when you look at any person, there's an invisible stamp on their forehead that says \"Heaven\" or \"Hell.\"\r\n                            1:22:23\r\n                            Okay, the person who's stamped \"Hell\" on the forehead, there is nothing you can do to guide them.\r\n                            1:22:29\r\n                            And the people who are stamped \"Heaven\", God knows, only God knows who is going to Heaven and who is going to Hell.\r\n                            1:22:36\r\n                            So, the person who is stamped \"Hell\" or misguided, there is no way you can make them understand.\r\n                            1:22:44\r\n                            The person who is stamped \"Heaven\" will see this and will accept it right away.\r\n                            1:22:49\r\n                            They will see that there is nothing wrong with it. It is in accordance with the Quran. There is sufficient proof.\r\n                            1:22:56\r\n                            They will... they may hold their judgment for a while until they examine the evidence and so on.\r\n                            1:23:08\r\n                            No, refers to you and me and anybody. Dr. Khalifa: Whatever you people will is in accordance with the will of God, Lord of the Universe.\r\n                            1:23:19\r\n                            A woman: So, it's like those who are on the straight path are somehow incapable of doing anything that is not according to God's will and the....?\r\n                            1:23:30\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, it is no the idea we always talked about it that... When we are born, God knows already the people who did not side with Satan during that Great Feud.\r\n                            1:23:42\r\n                            They didn't really side with Satan. Remember the Khutba, my last Khutba about the two arrows?\r\n                            1:23:49\r\n                            There are some people who went along with the crowd but in their heart they did not side with Satan. So, these people deserve to be guided. They deserve to be redeemed.\r\n                            1:23:58\r\n                            And they are put in circumstances that bring them in touch with this message, for example.\r\n                            1:24:06\r\n                            When they are born, they are assigned to a certain house, certain parents, to grow up under certain circumstances, and the end result will be that they're guided, because they deserve to be guided.\r\n                            1:24:23\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Douglas Douglas: This is a blessing (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:24:37\r\n                            and only mention (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:24:43\r\n                            It totally nullifies everything they're saying. Douglas: There are a lot of people who quote Quran, and read from the Quran and they say \"where did this explanation come from?\"\r\n                            1:24:53\r\n                            They say that God didn't send a messenger. But they immediately just continue to worshiping the messenger.\r\n                            1:24:59\r\n                            All of a sudden, people who need to hang on to someone, who can't be on their own. So, this is both a protection and a mercy for the people who are also guided.\r\n                            1:25:08\r\n                            One of the strategies of the atheists and non-believers is to tell you that you are incapable of standing up on your own.\r\n                            1:25:18\r\n                            You need someone else. The observation and the sign removes the doubt from the hearts of the believers.\r\n                            1:25:26\r\n                            You know that the motivation and incentives are from God to receive God's message.\r\n                            1:25:31\r\n                            And this list is describing... Dr. Khalifa: It's an obstacle, it's an obstacle for the misguided.\r\n                            1:25:48\r\n                            Say it again? A man: Table 5, why it is... Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, table 5 must be...\r\n                            1:25:56\r\n                            Edip: No, before it. Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, it's from the previous page.\r\n                            1:26:01\r\n                            This copy is just dealing with the number 81, because this is Sura 81.\r\n                            1:26:13\r\n                            The locust's playing havoc with the grocer?\r\n                            1:26:20\r\n                            Edip: Who will be the last person? Dr. Khalifa: Now, Douglas said that this is lucky for us because... actually, we have no idea how lucky our generation is.\r\n                            1:26:35\r\n                            Because this puts us in a place where we can belong with the elite of the elite.\r\n                            1:26:42\r\n                            The elite of the elite, or in the Quran, (56:10) ٱلسَّـٰبِقُونَ ٱلسَّـٰبِقُونَ Those who are especially close to God are the people of the first generation whenever a messenger comes, Abraham, or Ishmael, or Jesus, or Moses.\r\n                            Elite of the Elite are those who accept the message when it’s new.\r\n                            1:27:09\r\n                            Edip: Mã Shã Allãh Dr. Khalifa: It's gonna fly around and hit everybody.\r\n                            1:27:19\r\n                            The elite... The elite of the elite are the people who exist at the same time when the message is new\r\n                            1:27:31\r\n                            and the people are rejecting it, and you are being persecuted for accepting that message, which is worshipping God alone,\r\n                            1:27:38\r\n                            accepting the word of God alone. It's a very heavy responsibility, and the people who accept it are very, very, very, I can say this forever, fortunate.\r\n                            1:27:48\r\n                            Because they are the elite of the elite for eternity. And you're not born at this time by coincidence. There is a reason for it.\r\n                            1:27:57\r\n                            Obviously you deserve it. But to say that we are lucky or fortunate is the understatement of the century.\r\n                            1:28:08\r\n                            It is really a very, very exciting part of history, and I'm just talking as a person.\r\n                            1:28:15\r\n                            God happens to want us to know certain information to correct our path. And God's system, as we learn from the Quran, is that He selects one of us to distribute the information through one of us.\r\n                            1:28:28\r\n                            And doesn't make this one of us any better, or worse, or special.\r\n                            1:28:33\r\n                            There is no... and we have many lessons in the Quran indicating this. Moses, one of the great messengers, God sent a teacher in human form.\r\n                            1:28:42\r\n                            He could have been a human. Probably he was an angel. But God didn't tell us if he was a human or an angel. The fact is that Moses existed, and there was another servant of God who taught him a few things.\r\n                            1:28:55\r\n                            So, it's just a system whereby God distributes, disseminates information to all of us.\r\n                            1:29:04\r\n                            We are a very fortunate generation indeed. Alhamdu Lillah. Abdullah.\r\n                            1:29:17\r\n                            Abdullah: ... time of prophet Muhammad, Quran was revealed...\r\n                            1:29:25\r\n                            As I understand, it's been revealed...\r\n                            1:29:32\r\n                            God revealed certain things in the human form. And similarly, now the miracle has been revealed in such a way.\r\n                            1:29:46\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: I mean, I think we live these very exciting times, and we've seen how the information comes as we needed it at the right time.\r\n                            1:29:56\r\n                            When we... before printing the Quran, we were working on the appendix about the two false verses. And Mahmoud Abib, and Abdullah Erik, and Ismail Barakat, and Feroz Kermali, and Gatut were coming with information.\r\n                            1:30:08\r\n                            There was just pouring information coming. The evidence is very powerful and amazing.\r\n                            1:30:13\r\n                            I mean, we just couldn't catch our breath. And now that the book is in the press, they're very quiet, aren't they?\r\n                            1:30:20\r\n                            Do you hear anything from Mahmoud or Abdullah? No. But the information came at the right time.\r\n                            1:30:26\r\n                            It was just amazing. I mean, I will start the computer, and I will be working on this subject, and they will walk in with the information. As I'm... just put... just about to put my fingers on the keyboard at the time.\r\n                            1:30:40\r\n                            This is what Abdullah is talking about. Information comes as we need it.\r\n                            1:30:45\r\n                            And this is why we're so positive about God's signs.\r\n                            1:30:51\r\n                            We don't have doubts.\r\n                            \r\n                            19 Quran Study From Behrouz 919 Sura 2;89 119 Witchcraft Reverting Intro To Blue Quran No 13\r\n                            \r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: [2:89] ...They rejected it. God's condemnation thus afflicts the disbelievers.\r\n                            0:06\r\n                            This is something that we talked about at noon today, the ego.\r\n                            0:16\r\n                            As you see at the beginning of this book, if you open the cover and go a few sheets,\r\n                            0:24\r\n                            you see that once God alone is mentioned. Across from that, you see verses from the Old Testament and the New Testament prophesying\r\n                            0:36\r\n                            the advent of the Prophet Muhammad, the final prophet.\r\n                            0:41\r\n                            You see Moses in Deuteronomy 18:15 says \"a prophet like me,\" meaning a message-bearing messenger.\r\n                            0:51\r\n                            \"...will the Lord, your God, raise up for you from among your kinsmen;\"\r\n                            0:57\r\n                            The Arabs and Jews are kinsmen. \"to him you shall listen.\"\r\n                            1:02\r\n                            And in Deuteronomy 18:19, God says \"I will raise up for them a prophet like you...\"\r\n                            1:10\r\n                            God was speaking to Moses. \"...from among their kinsmen and will put my words into his mouth.\r\n                            1:17\r\n                            He shall tell them all that I command him. If any man will not listen to My words which he speaks in My name, I Myself will make him answer for it.\"\r\n                            1:27\r\n                            So, there's the prediction of the coming of the Prophet Muhammad to the Jews.\r\n                            1:34\r\n                            Of course, the Jews also were expecting the Messiah, Jesus, but when he came they wouldn't acknowledge him.\r\n                            1:42\r\n                            He was a human being like them. In spite of the miracles that he showed them, they failed to recognize him.\r\n                            1:50\r\n                            They called him \"imposter, a carpenter,\" not God's messenger.\r\n                            1:57\r\n                            It's just, you've seen today how bad the human being is. And we are the hardcore, egotistic gang among God's creatures.\r\n                            2:12\r\n                            And as you see here, God is saying \"I will put My words in his mouth, to him you shall listen.\"\r\n                            2:18\r\n                            The Jews were aware of this, as far as the Messiah was concerned, as far as Muhammad was concerned.\r\n                            2:24\r\n                            But it takes killing the ego to sit down and listen to a human being like you and me.\r\n                            2:32\r\n                            This is what we're exercising now. We're killing our ego in order to be redeemed, knowing\r\n                            2:38\r\n                            that we are listening to God's words in the Quran.\r\n                            2:43\r\n                            We're submitting to God, in whatever God does or says.\r\n                            2:49\r\n                            In the New Testament, you see the statement here from John 14, 16, 17. \"I will ask the\r\n                            2:55\r\n                            Father and He will give you another Paraclete, to be with you always, the spirit of truth.\r\n                            3:01\r\n                            And in John 16:13, \"when the spirit of truth comes to you, he will guide you to all truth\r\n                            3:09\r\n                            and will announce to you the things to come.\" So, the Christians also were given prophecy about the Prophet Muhammad.\r\n                            3:19\r\n                            But when he came, brought the Quran, a fantastic miracle, and he told them to worship God alone.\r\n                            3:30\r\n                            He told them who Jesus was, but they still they cannot recognize him.\r\n                            3:37\r\n                            And this is extended to the Messenger of the Covenant. The Muslims are recipients of the scripture. And God told them in the scripture \"the Messenger of the Covenant will come\r\n                            3:51\r\n                            after all the prophets have delivered their messages.\" And I'm quoting here Malachi. \"Lo, I am sending My messenger to prepare the way before Me, and suddenly,\r\n                            4:04\r\n                            He will come to the temple the Lord whom you seek, and the Messenger of the Covenant whom you desire.\r\n                            4:10\r\n                            Yes, he is coming, says the Lord of hosts,\" which is Rabbil ‘Alameen in Arabic, \"but who will endure the day of his coming?\r\n                            4:18\r\n                            And who can stand when he appears? For he is like the refiner's fire. He will sit purifying and refining.\"\r\n                            4:26\r\n                            So again, it's the ego here. \"Who will endure the day of his coming?\"\r\n                            4:34\r\n                            And how can you tell us that two verses that the Quran we've known all along had two verses wrong in it?\r\n                            4:41\r\n                            How do you tell us that the Salat Prayer we've been doing has been wrong?\r\n                            4:47\r\n                            And as you know, God blessed us, but because we did this gradually. We fixed. We were doing everything wrong.\r\n                            4:56\r\n                            You and I were doing everything wrong. And it takes killing the ego to give up things that we've been taught by our parents and things\r\n                            Takes strength to kill the Ego. Explains the rejection of Truth.\r\n                            5:07\r\n                            that we've been doing for a long time. It takes, actually, it takes more courage and more strength to say \"I was wrong, I'm gonna do the right thing now.\"\r\n                            5:19\r\n                            \"I'm gonna give up what was wrong even though my parents taught me that.\"\r\n                            5:25\r\n                            But this is not the case with the majority of people.\r\n                            5:30\r\n                            And this is what the Muslims are doing today. I mean, the Quran clearly says \"Muhammad was not the last messenger. He wasn't the Messenger of the Covenant.\"\r\n                            5:39\r\n                            And I'm not harping on this issue, but just the verse happens to state that, 89.\r\n                            5:45\r\n                            [2:89] When a scripture came to them from God confirming what they have, and even though they used to prophesy its advent to the disbelievers, when their own prophecy came to pass, they rejected it. God's condemnation thus afflicts the disbelievers.\r\n                            6:01\r\n                            So, this brings out their disbelief, because they claim to be believers.\r\n                            6:08\r\n                            And they claim to believe the Quran. Yet, when the Quran comes to pass, a Quranic prophecy, they fail to uphold it.\r\n                            6:18\r\n                            These same people who are rejecting the Messenger of the Covenant would have rejected the Prophet Muhammad if they existed at the same time.\r\n                            6:25\r\n                            They would have been the first to fight him. In fact, the Prophet struggled for 13 years in Mecca.\r\n                            6:32\r\n                            They were rejecting him, stoning him, banishing him, boycotting him and his followers.\r\n                            6:41\r\n                            These are the same people. And those bigwigs who are meeting in Chicago to preserve the finality of prophethood,\r\n                            6:50\r\n                            they would have been the first people to fight the Prophet Muhammad if they existed in his time.\r\n                            6:56\r\n                            In fact, they are Abu Lahab's, every single one of them. I mean, who was Abu Lahab?\r\n                            7:01\r\n                            Abu Lahab was the religious leader of his time, following the corrupted religion of Abraham, Islam or submission.\r\n                            7:09\r\n                            And he opposed the Prophet Muhammad who was telling him \"worship God alone. Here's the scripture of this religion.\"\r\n                            7:16\r\n                            And Abu Lahab faltered. Number 90,\r\n                            7:22\r\n                            [2:90] Miserable indeed is what they sold their souls for, disbelieving in God's revelations out of sheer resentment that God should bestow His grace upon whomever He chooses from among His servants. Consequently, they incurred wrath upon wrath. Such disbelievers have deserved humiliating retribution.\r\n                            7:43\r\n                            Why did they have to take these verses? this assignment.\r\n                            7:48\r\n                            Anyway, these are quite relevant to what is happening to us these days.\r\n                            7:54\r\n                            [2:90] Miserable indeed is what they sold their souls for, disbelieving in God's revelations... God tells them \"a messenger will come after all the prophets,\" but they disbelieve.\r\n                            8:06\r\n                            It's very clear in the Quran. And this is why they're so dumb in the sense that they don't say anything.\r\n                            8:14\r\n                            They are very quiet. They don't know what to say.\r\n                            8:20\r\n                            This is why they're getting their top leaders to put their heads together, pat each other on the back,\r\n                            8:26\r\n                            and gang together to distort the definition of prophet and messenger.\r\n                            8:32\r\n                            They don't believe God's revelations. [2:90] ....Out of sheer resentment that God should bestow His grace upon whomever He chooses from among His servants.\r\n                            8:42\r\n                            Where is Douglas? Is Douglas here? Hi, Douglas. Douglas was rooming in a hotel in one of the conferences of the probably social scientists, Muslim social scientists.\r\n                            8:55\r\n                            And this is one of the top leaders of the Muslims in America. Ilyas Ba-Yunus is his name.\r\n                            9:01\r\n                            And he rejected the mathematical miracle of the Quran, this Ba-Yunus.\r\n                            9:08\r\n                            And then the next day, Douglas is gonna correct me if I'm wrong, the next day,\r\n                            9:15\r\n                            Douglas realized that he actually knows the miracle and believes in it. So, Douglas asked him. You take it from there. \"Why don't you recognize the miracle?\" What did he say?\r\n                            9:26\r\n                            Douglas: I asked him why didn't he recognize the miracle. Then, his response was \"it didn't come from one of us.\"\r\n                            9:34\r\n                            \"It didn't come from one of us Muslim scholars, religious scholars.\" He said that Rashad didn't have the right place.\r\n                            9:43\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: \"He's not one of us.\" Douglas: \"He's not one of us. And he's not a religious scholar. He's not a Mulla.\" Dr. Khalifa: Mulla.\r\n                            9:52\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: So, this is exactly what this verse is saying. [2:90]...out of sheer resentment...\r\n                            9:57\r\n                            Not because it is not the truth, or because they do not recognize it, or because they don't understand it.\r\n                            10:02\r\n                            But it's simply [2:90] ...out of sheer resentment that God should bestow His grace upon whomever He chooses from among His servants. Consequently, they incurred wrath upon wrath. Such disbelievers have deserved humiliating retribution.\r\n                            10:18\r\n                            I want to share with you some other verses related to this.\r\n                            10:37\r\n                            Yep, they're human beings.\r\n                            10:47\r\n                            Ego. Ego is the big disaster.\r\n                            10:55\r\n                            Edip: وَكَذَٰلِكَ فَتَنَّا بَعْضَهُم بِبَعْضٍۢ لِّيَقُولُوٓا۟ أَهَـٰٓؤُلَآءِ مَنَّ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْهِم (6:53) مِّنۢ\r\n                            11:00\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: 21:36. Yeah, that's a good one too. Edip: 6:53. Dr. Khalifa: Ok. Let's look at 21:36. 21:36\r\n                            11:15\r\n                            Because it is similar to that statement that they told Douglas.\r\n                            11:22\r\n                            Under the subtitle \"All Messengers Ridiculed.\" 36, [21:36] When those who disbelieve see you, they ridicule you: \"Is this the one who talks about your idols?\" They totally disregard the message of the Most Gracious.\r\n                            11:35\r\n                            This is not the verse that I wanted to show you, but it's related. Edip: 6:53\r\n                            11:41\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Oh, there's another one.\r\n                            11:48\r\n                            (25:41) إِلَّا هُزُوًا أَهَـٰذَا ٱلَّذِى بَعَثَ ٱللَّهُ رَسُولًا\r\n                            11:53\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Ok. Let's look at 25:41. 25:41 must be the one I had in mind. They're very similar words.\r\n                            12:08\r\n                            Edip: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: 25:41, again, messengers ridiculed. [25:41] When they saw you, they always ridiculed you. \"Is this the one chosen by God to be a messenger?\"\r\n                            12:19\r\n                            [25:42] \"He almost diverted us from our gods, if it were not that we steadfastly revered them.\"\r\n                            12:25\r\n                            Counsel for preservation of the finality of prophethood. [25:42] ...They will certainly find out, when they see the retribution, who are the real strayers from the path.\r\n                            12:36\r\n                            Oh my gosh, 43. [25:43] Have you seen the one whose god is his ego? Are you going to be his advocate?\r\n                            12:45\r\n                            So, this is the reason why they cannot accept a human being. And this is exactly why God said \"if I sent an angel...\"\r\n                            12:56\r\n                            God said \"even if I sent an angel as a messenger, I will send him in the form of a human being, and I would confuse them as they are confused.\"\r\n                            13:08\r\n                            \"Miserable indeed,\" number 90, back to. [2:90] Miserable indeed is what they sold their souls for, disbelieving in God's revelations out of sheer resentment that God should bestow His grace upon whomever He chooses from among His servants. Consequently, they incurred wrath upon wrath. Such disbelievers have deserved humiliating retribution.\r\n                            13:30\r\n                            Let me share a couple more verses with you, so we can cover the subject,\r\n                            13:38\r\n                            and hopefully not see it for another long time.\r\n                            14:01\r\n                            43:32. Then, we'll move on. 43:32.\r\n                            14:12\r\n                            Probably 31. We'll look at it.\r\n                            14:20\r\n                            Okay, 31. Muhammad Ridiculed [43:31] They said, \"If only this Quran was sent down through another man from the two communities (Mecca or Medina) who is prominent!\"\r\n                            14:31\r\n                            They didn't like the Prophet Muhammad. And these very same people would have done the same thing then.\r\n                            14:38\r\n                            Now, 32 says, [43:32] Are they the ones who assign your Lord's mercy? We have assigned their shares in this life, raising some of them above others in ranks, in order to let them serve one another. However, the mercy from your Lord is far better than any material they may hoard.\r\n                            15:02\r\n                            But the same idea that applies to material things also applies to God's mercy as far as...\r\n                            15:07\r\n                            God blessed us to be believers. They cannot do anything if they resent that.\r\n                            15:17\r\n                            91, back to page 14. [2:91] When they are told, \"You shall believe in what GOD had sent down herein,\" they say, \"We believe only in what was sent down to us.\" They reject subsequent revelations, even if it is the truth from their Lord, and even though it confirms what they have! Say, \"if you did believe in the revelations given to you, why then did you kill God's prophets, if you are truthful?\"\r\n                            15:47\r\n                            As you know, the prophets of Israel, almost all of them were killed by the children of Israel.\r\n                            15:55\r\n                            \"Lessons from Israel\" 92. [2:92] Moses went to you with profound miracles, yet you worshiped the calf in his absence, and you turned wicked.\r\n                            16:11\r\n                            [2:93] Also, we made a covenant with you, as we raised Mount Sinai above you, saying, \"You shall uphold the commandments we have given you, strongly, and listen.\" But they said, \"We hear, but we disobey.\" Their hearts became filled with adoration for the calf, due to their disbelief. Say, \"Miserable indeed is what your faith dictates upon you, if you do have any faith.\"\r\n                            16:34\r\n                            94, [2:94] Say, \"If the abode of the Hereafter is really reserved for you at GOD, to the exclusion of all other people, then you should long for death, if you are truthful.\"\r\n                            16:46\r\n                            [2:95] They never long for it, because of what their hands have sent forth. GOD is fully aware of the wicked.\r\n                            16:52\r\n                            I wanna go back to verse 92. [2:92] Moses went to you with profound miracles, yet you worshiped the calf in his absence, and you turned wicked.\r\n                            Despite all miracles Moses people witnessed only 2 remained believers.\r\n                            17:01\r\n                            Because this again is a continuation of the Khutba today on how bad the humans are and\r\n                            17:08\r\n                            how fortunate we are. We must thank God and say \"Alhamdu Lillah.\" Thank him profusely for guiding us.\r\n                            17:16\r\n                            This will be our prayer, IN SHAA ALLAH, in Heaven as you know from the Quran. We're gonna spend eternity saying \"thank God for guiding us.\"\r\n                            17:26\r\n                            I wanted, actually, to say this in the Khutba, but I forgot. Do you know how many people believed in Moses after all the miracles,\r\n                            17:32\r\n                            after parting the Red Sea? 120,000 people, they estimate, watched the Red Sea part. Did anybody see a hill of water?\r\n                            17:45\r\n                            There were 2 hills of water on the sides and... And these people walked between two hills of water.\r\n                            17:50\r\n                            And if you saw the movie, it made a very good approximation. the Ten Commandments.\r\n                            17:57\r\n                            Cecil B. DeMille did a good job there. And then after they crossed, Pharaoh and his army goes behind them and they drown and die,\r\n                            18:05\r\n                            the enemies before their eyes. God says in the Quran \"before your eyes.\" They saw this and many other miracles.\r\n                            18:11\r\n                            So, how many people believed at the very end when they reached their destination and Moses said\r\n                            18:18\r\n                            \"now go into Jerusalem.\" And they said \"there are people there, we don't wanna go and fight with them. You and your Lord go and fight. We're going to sit right here.\"\r\n                            18:27\r\n                            Two people. Moses, Aaron, and two people.\r\n                            18:32\r\n                            That's how bad the humans are. Now fortunately, Sura 5, verse 23. This is what it tells us.\r\n                            18:42\r\n                            Just two people believed with Moses. Now, I don't want you to be too scared because this is not applicable, the same principle\r\n                            18:52\r\n                            is not applicable to us. We thank God for it that God assigned us to this generation.\r\n                            18:58\r\n                            We are very fortunate because the last Sura in the Quran revealed, Sura 110, is 19 words and talks about\r\n                            19:08\r\n                            entering God's religion in great numbers.\r\n                            19:15\r\n                            And this is applicable to us. The first verse is 19 letters and the whole Sura is 19 words.\r\n                            19:21\r\n                            But at the same time, don't be lax. You must watch your ego because making it, as you see and\r\n                            19:31\r\n                            worshipping God alone and killing our ego is the greatest triumph.\r\n                            19:38\r\n                            We've made quite a few mistakes. Initially, when Satan wanted to be a god, we made a big mistake.\r\n                            19:45\r\n                            When God gave us another chance, we made a bigger mistake.\r\n                            19:52\r\n                            And you've seen the, you've seen the proportion of how bad the humans are.\r\n                            Earth is a halfway house to hell.\r\n                            20:03\r\n                            And it's all ego from Satan's ego to our ego. This is what exiled us from God's kingdom\r\n                            20:10\r\n                            We're in exile from God's kingdom because of our ego and if we don't kill this ego,\r\n                            20:17\r\n                            we will continue to be eternally exiled. Now, this is our last chance in this world. It's our chance.\r\n                            20:28\r\n                            God is giving us a taste of what Hell is like. This is halfway house to Hell.\r\n                            20:37\r\n                            It is.\r\n                            20:46\r\n                            It's amazing how many problems there are in this world that we're seeing. Yes?\r\n                            Repentance, we must believe God will turn sins into credit – Satan will give you a guilt complex over old or new sins – Repeating sins – we must repent and observe commandments. Read Quran every day At least 2 pages.\r\n                            21:00\r\n                            A man: ..... using your will to suppress Satan and his ideas in your head.\r\n                            21:09\r\n                            A man: Can you ask for repent for me? Sometimes, I ask for repent for a sin or (unintelligible) or a lie or something. Then, I find how Satan brings it back.\r\n                            21:22\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: This is his job. He's doing his job. Dr. Khalifa: He uses, he uses reverse psychology. He tells you \"you're bad. You're bad.\"\r\n                            21:30\r\n                            A man: .... but I don't know whether to, he uses my ego not in the negative sense. If I... Satan (unintelligible) a week then I know it continues. Then, I will fight with it.\r\n                            21:51\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Well, what you need to say to Satan is that you believe God, when He says \"repentance wipes out the sins and turns them into credits.\" And don't let Satan\r\n                            22:02\r\n                            trick you into, into saying that, or giving you a guilt complex over an old sin or a new sin.\r\n                            22:11\r\n                            A man: You know, it's not that... that's one aspect. (unintelligible) the future. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            22:17\r\n                            A man: Then, I continued to strongly to grow in righteousness. Dr. Khalifa: Right.\r\n                            22:22\r\n                            A man: I mean, I find myself trying to stop mind and Satan, cause I don't... you know, I know like I made a mistake but I don't wanna do it again so...\r\n                            22:34\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: This is what repentance is all about. You pledge that you'll never do it again but being a human, you probably will do it again a few times\r\n                            22:41\r\n                            until you realize that the price is too high. The pinch is too painful or the price is too high. Then, you'll... God knows\r\n                            22:48\r\n                            God will guide you. God says... God gives you the means to fight Satan and they are worshipping God regularly.\r\n                            22:58\r\n                            You must maintain the Five Prayers, the Fasting of Ramadan. You must be conscious of God, the commemoration of God every chance you get.\r\n                            23:06\r\n                            God must be on your mind the majority of the time. Because one of the Khutbas that you missed was \"who is your god?\"\r\n                            23:14\r\n                            And the answer is \"whatever you're thinking of most of the time, that's your god.\" So, God gives us guidelines in the Quran as to how to keep God in our mind the majority of the time.\r\n                            23:25\r\n                            Like saying \"IN SHAA ALLAH, Mã Shã Allãh, Alhamdu Lillah, Subhan Allah\" in English or Arabic or in any language, as long as you think about God most of the time.\r\n                            23:34\r\n                            So, reading the Quran... you have to read the Quran every day, at least two pages every day.\r\n                            23:40\r\n                            I know you do that. Where is your copy of the new Quran?\r\n                            23:46\r\n                            I don't wanna embarrass you. We have copies here. A man: I know. I just wanted to Dr. Khalifa: Ok.\r\n                            23:51\r\n                            A man: I just wanted to understand the fact that we're responsible for saying \"Astaghfirullah.\" Dr. Khalifa: Right.\r\n                            24:01\r\n                            A man: The way I say it is correct? Dr. Khalifa: Yep.\r\n                            24:09\r\n                            92. Lessons From Israel. We did that. 93. Ok. So, we're talking about Moses and 120,000 out of them, only two believed.\r\n                            24:17\r\n                            And the other half of the Khutba today was how fortunate we are in that we are the generation that\r\n                            24:27\r\n                            God showed us the miracle of the Quran based on the number 19, and the last Sura revealed to the Quran is 19 words\r\n                            24:36\r\n                            and that it applies to our generation. We thank God for that. Let us read it. 110.\r\n                            24:42\r\n                            Sura 110 is in page what? Because it applies to us.\r\n                            24:52\r\n                            603. Page 603, Sura 110 is \"Triumph.\" The greatest triumph is to denounce our crime and believe in God alone and worship him alone. Last Sura revealed.\r\n                            25:06\r\n                            In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful [110:1] When triumph comes from GOD, and victory.\r\n                            25:11\r\n                            19 letters in Arabic. [110:2] You will see the people embracing GOD's religion in throngs.\r\n                            25:17\r\n                            [110:3] You shall glorify and praise your Lord, and implore Him for forgiveness. He is the Redeemer.\r\n                            25:24\r\n                            So, this is the good news. We just have to be careful not to blow it this time. We blew it before a few times.\r\n                            25:33\r\n                            This is our last chance, and we better not blow it. I want to complete the picture for you that ego, like I mentioned in the Khutba today,\r\n                            25:41\r\n                            is not that somebody comes and slaps you in the face and you turn the other cheek. This is, this is not relevant to your spiritual salvation.\r\n                            25:50\r\n                            We're talking about ego as far as God is concerned. We must kill our ego and that we have to do the Five Prayers, and regardless of what the people think, for example.\r\n                            God controls your happiness and Misery. Believers don’t care\\not scared about blamers.\r\n                            26:04\r\n                            Fast the month of Ramadan, regardless of what the people think. The people will not put you in Heaven or Hell. They will not save you.\r\n                            26:10\r\n                            God is the One who will put you in Heaven, IN SHAA ALLAH. God is the One who will save you.\r\n                            26:16\r\n                            God is the One who controls your kidneys and lungs, controls your health, your happiness. Directly, God says that in Sura 54.\r\n                            26:24\r\n                            It says \"God is the One who controls your happiness or misery.\" (53:43) وَأَنَّهُۥ هُوَ أَضْحَكَ وَأَبْكَىٰ\r\n                            26:30\r\n                            God is... This is the Arabic. Very clearly, God controls your happiness.\r\n                            26:36\r\n                            Nothing else, your friends, your relatives, your parents, your children.\r\n                            26:41\r\n                            Nobody controls your happiness or misery. God is the only One who controls happiness.\r\n                            26:47\r\n                            Therefore, if you are wise or intelligent, you don't care what people say. You worship God and you don't care who blames you for it.\r\n                            26:56\r\n                            One of the descriptions of the believers in the Quran \"they don't worry about the blaming of the blamers.\"\r\n                            27:04\r\n                            (5:54) لَا يَخَافُونَ لَوْمَةَ لَآئِمٍۢ لَوْمَةَ لَآئِمٍۢ blaming of the blamers\r\n                            27:09\r\n                            You don't care about any blame.\r\n                            27:15\r\n                            It's very important not to blow it this time. What?\r\n                            27:23\r\n                            I'll give you the... (5:54) لَوْمَةَ لَآئِمٍۢ\r\n                            27:41\r\n                            It's so difficult. Where did you find it?\r\n                            28:02\r\n                            Just look at خَافُ\r\n                            28:15\r\n                            Edip: 5:54 Dr. Khalifa: 5:54? How did you do that? 5:54, Martha.\r\n                            28:26\r\n                            5:54 says, [5:54] O you who believe, if you revert from your religion, GOD will substitute in your place people whom He loves and they love Him. People who are humble with the believers, but stern with the disbelievers, and will strive in the cause of GOD without fear of any blamer.\r\n                            28:49\r\n                            There's, there's another verse also that is even clearer than this, but this is good enough.\r\n                            28:55\r\n                            I'm glad we read this verse here. [5:54] O you who believe, if you revert from your religion,...\r\n                            Shying away from our practises. It takes killing the EGO to be humble with the believers. Raised Mount Sanai explained.\r\n                            29:00\r\n                            You know, when you shy away and you don't practice your religion, this is reverting.\r\n                            29:07\r\n                            [5:54] .....GOD will substitute in your place people whom He loves.... God doesn't care.\r\n                            29:13\r\n                            Only if you believe that He cares about you.\r\n                            29:18\r\n                            [5:54] .....GOD will substitute in your place people whom He loves and they love Him. People who are humble with the believers, and stern with the disbelievers,...\r\n                            29:26\r\n                            This is what I was talking about \"if somebody slaps you in the face.\" You know, with the believers, you're a pussycat. But with the disbelievers, you're a lion.\r\n                            29:39\r\n                            It takes killing the ego to be humble with the believers.\r\n                            29:45\r\n                            And you don't fear any blamer. [5:54] .....Such is GOD's blessing; He bestows it upon whomever He wills. GOD is Bounteous, Omniscient.\r\n                            29:59\r\n                            Let's go to 97. Gabriel Mediates the Revelation Yes, sir.\r\n                            30:08\r\n                            A man: The verse \"we raised Mount Sinai above you\" (unintelligible).\r\n                            30:18\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Physically, physically raised the mountain on top of them like an umbrella.\r\n                            30:26\r\n                            Yep. That's one of the miracles.\r\n                            30:31\r\n                            They've seen miracles. Only two believed in the end. They're so bad. I mean, God raised the mountain on top of them as a sign that He is speaking to them\r\n                            30:41\r\n                            and made a covenant with them, the ten commandments.\r\n                            30:49\r\n                            I don't think it is in the Old Testament. Some of the miracles disappeared, probably they didn't believe it or they just dropped out for some reason.\r\n                            30:59\r\n                            I don't remember seeing it. Dr. Khalifa: What do you wanna say? Edip: The raising mountain can be in a way that we made mountains that gives you shadow.\r\n                            31:07\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, no, no. It says, (7:171) كَأَنَّهُۥ ظُلَّةٌۭ Dr. Khalifa: like umbrella. Edip: Oh, yes.\r\n                            31:12\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Yes. Edip: We discussed this (unintelligible). I didn't get this that umbrella.\r\n                            31:18\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: See how difficult it is to believe? Edip is wondering if it is some other raising. Edip: No, no. A man: We were going over the Turkish translation. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            31:25\r\n                            A man: He was, so he translated right. I didn't (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: umbrella. Yes. Edip: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            31:30\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: In another place, God said \"I raised the mountain on top of them like an umbrella.\" See, how the umbrella covers you?\r\n                            31:35\r\n                            Edip: I can't believe it. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. A man: So, it was another miracle. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            31:43\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: It's a miracle and it's also like a gun to your head.\r\n                            31:50\r\n                            Edip: In the desert, they need shadow. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            32:04\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Who's this?\r\n                            32:13\r\n                            What did you say, Donna? I'm sorry.\r\n                            32:20\r\n                            Yes, yes, exactly. Twice in the Quran, it is mentioned.\r\n                            32:28\r\n                            It can be also the day of the umbrella. یوم ظُلَّةٌۭ It's a good... do you have it in Turkish? ظُلَّةٌۭ. ظُلَّةٌۭ. Shadow?\r\n                            32:37\r\n                            Edip: (unintelligible) yes. Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible) Edip: (unintelligible) yes.\r\n                            32:42\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: 97. Gabriel Mediates the Revelation\r\n                            32:50\r\n                            [2:97] Say, \"Whoever is an enemy of Gabriel should know that he has revealed this (Quran) into your heart, in accordance with GOD's will, confirming previous scriptures, and providing guidance and good news for the believers.\"\r\n                            “Muslims” disregard God’s scripture.\r\n                            33:03\r\n                            [2:98] If one opposes GOD, His angels, His messengers, Gabriel and Michael, then GOD opposes the disbelievers.\r\n                            33:10\r\n                            What a trade. 99. [2:99] We have sent down to you clear revelations, and only the wicked will reject them.\r\n                            33:19\r\n                            [2:100] Is it not a fact that whenever they make a covenant, some of them will violate it? Indeed, most of them do not believe.\r\n                            33:28\r\n                            Proof of Disbelief. When a messenger came from God,... [2:101] When a messenger from God went to them confirming what they have, some followers of the scripture disregarded GOD's scripture behind their backs, as if they never had any scripture.\r\n                            33:43\r\n                            Now, if this is applicable to the Jews, for example, why did GOD put it here in the Quran?\r\n                            33:53\r\n                            Because all the interpretation and understanding is that this is directed to the Jews, which is perfectly alright.\r\n                            34:01\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: But why did God put it here? It's for us to read, right? A man: Sure. Dr. Khalifa: And to learn from this, and because this will be done by so-called Muslims. This is exactly what's happening today.\r\n                            34:13\r\n                            [2:101] When a messenger from God went to them confirming what they have, some followers of the scripture... This includes Jews, Christians and Muslims.\r\n                            34:21\r\n                            [2:101] ....disregarded GOD's scripture behind their backs, as if they never had any scripture.\r\n                            34:33\r\n                            The announcement that I mentioned today at the Khutba does not have the name of God in it whatsoever.\r\n                            34:40\r\n                            It does not have IN SHAA ALLAH. It does not follow the Quran. There is no Quran in it at all, and anyone can look at it.\r\n                            34:47\r\n                            So, they completely disregard God's scripture. God tells you \"you must say \"God willing\" when you say \"we will do something.\"\"\r\n                            34:56\r\n                            And when we wrote about our conference, for example, we said \"IN SHAA ALLAH.\" We said \"God willing.\"\r\n                            35:03\r\n                            Because the Quran dictates that as a commandment. You must say \"God willing\" if you're gonna talk about the future.\r\n                            35:11\r\n                            And let the people...Ok. This is where you don't feel the blaming of any blamer. If they're gonna laugh at you because you said \"God willing,\" let them.\r\n                            35:18\r\n                            I mean, what will happen to you if they laugh at you? They cannot control your happiness or health.\r\n                            35:25\r\n                            So, you say it with courage and enthusiasm, whether it is your boss or your professor.\r\n                            35:33\r\n                            Yes. Right. Yes, exactly.\r\n                            35:38\r\n                            In fact, this is the whole idea. A woman: ....remember God when we're busy. Dr. Khalifa: You're delivering a message when you do that.\r\n                            35:44\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: You're reminding the people that there is a God, because they say \"wait a minute.\"\r\n                            35:49\r\n                            You know, he's just saying to a guy in the market. \"I'll come back for the tomatoes, God willing, in two hours.\"\r\n                            35:56\r\n                            And they will, they will, they will... This reminds them that there is a God.\r\n                            36:01\r\n                            You're doing the job. And you're benefiting your own soul.\r\n                            36:07\r\n                            So, they completely disregard the scripture. 102. Witchcraft.\r\n                            36:15\r\n                            [2:102] They pursued what the devils told them concerning the powers of Solomon.\r\n                            36:21\r\n                            Remember moving the palace from one place to place, 2,000 miles or something, 1,000 miles?\r\n                            36:27\r\n                            Of course, this is one thing that we know about, but there were other powers that the jinns did for Solomon.\r\n                            36:36\r\n                            There were movies made about Solomon, and the treasures of Solomon, where they shot some of these superhuman things.\r\n                            36:44\r\n                            [2:102] ...Solomon, however, was not a disbeliever.... In other words, he did not abuse the power that God put at his disposal.\r\n                            36:53\r\n                            [2:102] ....while the devils are disbelievers. Thus, they taught the people witchcraft.\r\n                            36:58\r\n                            What is witchcraft and magic? It's using the jinns.\r\n                            “Witchcraft” explained, uses the Jinns.\r\n                            37:05\r\n                            It's no big deal, actually. I think you go to the library and learn magic, witchcraft. There are many books on witchcraft.\r\n                            37:14\r\n                            In fact, you don't need any books. You can sit in a room and talk to the jinns until they respond to you if you want to get in trouble, because they are in the same room with you.\r\n                            37:26\r\n                            And if you talk to them long enough, some rascal jinn passing by who wants to have some fun will respond to you.\r\n                            37:34\r\n                            And like Sura 72 tells us, they will give you trouble in the end because they're much more powerful than you. I can tell you that.\r\n                            37:41\r\n                            So, you can imagine an invisible lion passing by and you're trying to pet him or something.\r\n                            37:51\r\n                            But he's invisible. They're much, much more powerful than the lion.\r\n                            37:57\r\n                            So, it doesn't make sense that they will be your slave. They will fool you for a while. They will do certain things for you.\r\n                            38:03\r\n                            And this is why those people that you see on the TV, they don't last.\r\n                            38:09\r\n                            Because jinns will not serve them for too long. Maybe a few months and then they disappear. Otherwise, it would have been a big hit.\r\n                            38:17\r\n                            And I remember one of them, when the election was between Carter and Reagan,\r\n                            38:23\r\n                            this ESP fellow, using the jinns, was on the Today Show two weeks before the elections.\r\n                            38:32\r\n                            And he gave Jane Pauley, is that her name? A woman: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: Yeah.\r\n                            38:38\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: He gave her an envelope, sealed envelope. And he said \"this envelope will have who won the elections and how many votes,\" if it is Reagan or Carter, and how many votes.\r\n                            38:48\r\n                            \"I will come back on the election. The next day of the election, we'll open the envelope and you're gonna see in it the winner and the number of votes.\"\r\n                            38:57\r\n                            Unfortunately, I didn't see that program, but he probably came and they probably opened the envelope and saw that the winner was Reagan and how many votes. So, how did that happen?\r\n                            39:07\r\n                            They show you on TV somebody who's standing on a stage and some person in the audience\r\n                            39:12\r\n                            will take his wallet out and this fellow on the stage will read what's in the wallet, the money, the driver's license.\r\n                            39:20\r\n                            How does he do this? He's using jinns. Now, this is fantastic, right?\r\n                            39:25\r\n                            And it should be a show that will last for 10 years, but they don't. Because the jinn will go read the wallet and will come and whisper it in his ears and he read the\r\n                            39:33\r\n                            thing and everybody will be impressed. But next week, when he wants to use the jinn again, the jinn will say \"wait a minute, who do you think you are?\"\r\n                            39:43\r\n                            And they will not cooperate. Sura 72.\r\n                            39:48\r\n                            Usually it is the last time you see them on the TV. The jinn is having fun, you know, national TV, you know, impressing the audience and all that, but they don't last.\r\n                            40:04\r\n                            For one thing, they can take a trip that is 10 light years away, then they lose their cooperating entity.\r\n                            40:13\r\n                            So, I wanna go back to 102. [2:102] ....Solomon was not a disbeliever, while the devils are disbelievers. Thus, they taught the people witchcraft that was sent down through the two angels of Babel, Haroot and Maroot.\r\n                            40:30\r\n                            [2:102] ....These two did not divulge such knowledge without pointing out that \"This is a test. You shall not abuse such knowledge.\"\r\n                            40:38\r\n                            So, God actually sent the knowledge to the planet earth as part of the test to see who's gonna use it, who's gonna abuse it.\r\n                            40:47\r\n                            And as you know, a lot of people do abuse it. You should come to Egypt and see what they do.\r\n                            40:54\r\n                            [2:102] ......But the people used it in such evil schemes as the breaking up of marriages. They can never harm anyone against the will of God. They learn only what hurts them, not what benefits them,\r\n                            41:12\r\n                            [2:102] ......and they knew full well that whoever practices such evil will have no share in the Hereafter. Miserable indeed is what they sold their souls for, if they only knew.\r\n                            41:24\r\n                            So, when you hear about this phenomenon in the newspaper, you understand exactly what is happening.\r\n                            41:29\r\n                            103. [2:103] Had they believed and led a righteous life, the reward from GOD would have been far better, if they only knew.\r\n                            41:39\r\n                            Twisting the Words of Supplication [2:104] O you who believe, do not say, \"Raa'ena\"* (be our shepherd). You should say, \"Unzurna\" (watch over us), and listen. The disbelievers have incurred a painful retribution.\r\n                            41:54\r\n                            You can generalize this. If there are words that sound like bad words, you don't have to use them.\r\n                            42:01\r\n                            It's better to avoid them. So, this doesn't apply to people who do not speak Arabic, but it will apply as a general rule.\r\n                            42:14\r\n                            I was talking to somebody the other day about... I was talking to Robert actually, about university degrees and so on, and I repeated the word BS a lot.\r\n                            42:25\r\n                            But this word BS sounds like a bad word in the general language. \"Oh, you can get a BS by doing this and that, and studying this and that.\"\r\n                            42:33\r\n                            It means a Bachelor's degree. Dr. Khalifa: But BS has other meanings. So, it is better to avoid using those words.\r\n                            42:40\r\n                            Cisco: But it's actually what it is. Cisco: It's BS.\r\n                            42:46\r\n                            Cisco: Because I mean... Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, tell us about it, Cisco. Cisco: You know, because people could be graduating in science, and they could run a business.\r\n                            42:55\r\n                            Or it could be the opposite way. Cisco: They could be graduating in business and going to work in a field application which is BS. Dr. Khalifa: Yes, exactly.\r\n                            43:01\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: It's a bunch of BS.\r\n                            43:07\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: I'm just giving an example. Where is Robert? I thought Robert was here.\r\n                            43:15\r\n                            Oh, Robert is there. Ok.\r\n                            43:20\r\n                            105. Jealousy Condemned\r\n                            43:26\r\n                            [2:105] Neither the disbelievers among the followers of the scripture... like Ba-Yunus\r\n                            43:31\r\n                            [2:105] ...nor the idol worshippers wish to see any blessings come your way from your Lord. However, GOD showers His blessings upon whomever He chooses. GOD possesses infinite grace.\r\n                            43:47\r\n                            I think I'm very proud of Apamea and Naghmeh, for example, because they went through so much jealousy and people harassing them about going to Masjid Tucson.\r\n                            44:01\r\n                            But they steadfastly persevered. And this is why they're in for lots of rewards, IN SHAA ALLAH.\r\n                            44:10\r\n                            Hey, Naghmeh, how come every time I call Edip's house, you answer the phone? I mean, your sister is married now.\r\n                            44:20\r\n                            Mã Shã Allãh\r\n                            44:25\r\n                            I love it, though. It's beautiful. Naghmeh: It's her voice that sounds like mine. Dr. Khalifa: Is that right? Maghmeh: Yeah.\r\n                            44:37\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: See, they are cooperating. Well then, how do you explain it when Apamea is here and I call and you answer?\r\n                            44:48\r\n                            Well, as long as you don't keep Edip on the couch outside in the living room, it's Ok.\r\n                            44:57\r\n                            106.\r\n                            45:05\r\n                            ‘Alaykum Al-Salaam\r\n                            45:10\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible) Haroot Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            45:23\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: They brought the knowledge of witchcraft to the planet Earth. And they taught a few people.\r\n                            45:31\r\n                            And they spread it around until it was imported to Boston, Massachusetts.\r\n                            45:40\r\n                            How long ago was it? A hundred years? The witches?\r\n                            45:46\r\n                            Yes. It's just, you know, God sends information to the Earth through angels.\r\n                            45:54\r\n                            And Haroot and Maroot happen to be the angels who carried the knowledge about witchcraft, here.\r\n                            46:00\r\n                            Because it's a definite science. I mean, you have to stand somewhere and draw a triangle and throw some chicken...\r\n                            46:10\r\n                            ....do that will lure them.\r\n                            46:17\r\n                            A man: Some patients, not a lot of, some patients in psychiatric facilities have called it one jinn. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            46:25\r\n                            A man: In any psychiatric facilities, they become victims. And when you walk around in the buildings,\r\n                            46:31\r\n                            you can definitely see they're possessed. And anyone you see (unintelligible) everyday.\r\n                            46:41\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yes, we do hear about all these phenomena a lot but there are people who actually practice witchcraft and that originally came down through these two angels, Haroot and Maroot. So, you know everything about it. Question?\r\n                            46:57\r\n                            Edip: Rashad, I wanna say something about \"Raa'ena.\" Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            47:02\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Oh, my goodness\r\n                            47:14\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Go ahead. Edip: About word \"Raa'ena\" in verse 104, be our shepherd,\r\n                            47:19\r\n                            the word by itself is not a dirty word, but the meaning... Dr. Khalifa: Hebrew it was. Do you know Hebrew?\r\n                            47:26\r\n                            Edip: I don't know Hebrew. Dr. Khalifa: So, how do you know it's not a dirty word? Edip: Let me. My understanding, I don't know if it's correct or not, \"Raa'ena\" means \"be our shepherd\" and\r\n                            47:38\r\n                            Edip: those people that who used this accept themselves as sheep and... Dr. Khalifa: No.\r\n                            47:43\r\n                            Edip: This is... Dr. Khalifa: No, it's in Sura 4, you see, if you look at 4:46... Edip: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: But let's not look. I don't wanna waste time on this one. But it's just, in the Hebrew language, it sounds like a dirty word.\r\n                            47:56\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Pardon? Dr. Khalifa: \"Raa'ena\" is Arabic. But you can say an Arabic word that's dirty in English and vice versa. Yes\r\n                            48:14\r\n                            Why are we laughing, Emily?\r\n                            48:22\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yes, Naghmeh. Cause I remember your incident with Ihsan, Naghmeh. Naghmeh: I didn't know.\r\n                            48:33\r\n                            A woman: I know that nothing happens because of (unintelligible). And here, because they used their evil in breaking of the marriages. They can never harm anyone against the will of God.\r\n                            48:49\r\n                            So, (unintelligible) people (unintelligible) God willed it to happen. I mean, I don't understand like how that could be used.\r\n                            48:58\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Ok. You're forcing me to give you a real life story. Dr. Khalifa: Ok, there's a person who uses witchcraft and tried to harm me in this way and the jinn, that was supposed to come and\r\n                            Dr. Rashad Khalifa explains an incident of Witchcraft against him.\r\n                            49:13\r\n                            hurt me, came here and my... we all have guards, angels.\r\n                            49:20\r\n                            And this was against the will of God. So, the angels told the jinn \"what are you here for?\" He said \"we're here to hit Rashad.\" He said \"ok, you go back and hit the person who sent you.\"\r\n                            49:31\r\n                            And the jinn did and sure enough that person called on the machine here and she was almost dying.\r\n                            49:38\r\n                            So, it backfired on her. But this is an example of \"they cannot harm anyone against the will of God.\" Did that confuse you more?\r\n                            49:47\r\n                            A woman: No. Dr. Khalifa: Ok. This person practiced witchcraft from, from a country that is famous for witchcraft.\r\n                            49:59\r\n                            And she was trying to stop me. So, she practiced witchcraft on me but what happened was that the jinn that was supposed to carry out that,\r\n                            50:08\r\n                            since it is against God's will, I didn't deserve it, I didn't do anything wrong on that day, on that day,\r\n                            50:13\r\n                            the jinn was sent back and did that thing to that person and she almost died. And we have a few witnesses.\r\n                            50:23\r\n                            A woman: Are we talking about real witchcraft? Dr. Khalifa: Real. This is real witchcraft. I'm telling you. She almost died. She was paralyzed.\r\n                            50:31\r\n                            What country? Haiti. Haiti. Haiti is full of voodoo. And voodoo, for example, is that real? Is voodoo real?\r\n                            50:41\r\n                            It is real and it is jinn. When you make a doll that looks like Muhtesem, and you get a pin,\r\n                            50:52\r\n                            and the jinn... now the jinns, as you know, are very fast. They see that you're poking,\r\n                            50:59\r\n                            pulling his ear, for example, so they go and pull his ear. This is the mechanism of it.\r\n                            51:04\r\n                            It's real. I mean, this is what the Quran is teaching us. Yes. A woman: So, if two people get divorced, does that, you know,... I mean,...\r\n                            51:15\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Well, everything, ultimately, is the will of God. Ok. But I want you to understand this that bad things are from us.\r\n                            51:21\r\n                            Good things are from God. For example, I use the example of the fire. If you turn the stove on, it is God's law that if you put your finger in the fire, it will hurt, right?\r\n                            51:30\r\n                            It's God's law. So, it is the will of God that if you put your finger in the fire, it will hurt.\r\n                            51:35\r\n                            But if you use the fire to cook your burned rice, the Iranian people burn rice at the bottom,\r\n                            51:41\r\n                            they don't know how to cook rice. You can use the, you can use the fire...\r\n                            51:48\r\n                            A woman: (unintelligible). A woman: (unintelligible) their faces (unintelligible).\r\n                            51:58\r\n                            A man: I know the Persians (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: That's my favorite part, the burned rice.\r\n                            52:04\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: You know, at first, they were saying \"the dumb guy, you know, he doesn't think we do it on purpose.\" But anyway, so you can use the fire to cook your food or to burn your finger.\r\n                            52:13\r\n                            So, if you use it to cook the food, it's from God. If you burn your finger, it's from you because you decided to put your finger in the fire.\r\n                            52:21\r\n                            But not every people who are divorced are because of witchcraft. However, they do use witchcraft for this.\r\n                            52:26\r\n                            If it is in accordance with God's will, if these people are out of God's protection, the jinns will bother them.\r\n                            52:35\r\n                            But you are... when you are in God's protection, nothing can touch you. They cannot touch you. A woman: But what if individuals have tried to, you know, hurt, you know, two other people and they were hurt for a while and then they got better and then the other person (unintelligible) on them.\r\n                            52:49\r\n                            You know, and they were ultimately the ones (unintelligible). They were hurt, you know for the time being. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            52:56\r\n                            A woman: I don't if it was witchcraft or not but whatever... Dr. Khalifa: That was in accordance with God's will, they were not protected at the time for some reason.\r\n                            Angels guarding you are much stronger than the Jinns. Most people are out of God’s kingdom. When you miss a Prayer (salat) you are out of God’s protection. “Pinches” controlled by God. Talk of the EVIL eye.\r\n                            53:05\r\n                            But this day, they can repent any time. They can join God's protection any time. Then, the jinns who are bothering them will not be able to do anything anymore.\r\n                            53:16\r\n                            When you're in God's Kingdom nothing can touch you. This is the message that we've been living it. We've been living it for 11-12 years now.\r\n                            53:27\r\n                            So, our confidence is increasing. It is now absolute when God tells you \"I guarantee you perfect happiness, perfect health perfect wealth,\" God means it and He does it.\r\n                            53:40\r\n                            So, using the jinns... remember the angels who are guarding you are much stronger. But if you're out of God's protection,\r\n                            53:47\r\n                            if you're a... the person is bad and is against God and an idol worshipper, the angels who are guarding him hate him.\r\n                            53:55\r\n                            So, when a jinn comes to slap him on the face, they say \"yeah, be my guest.\" This is what the mechanism is of being out of God's protection.\r\n                            54:06\r\n                            Right They're not protected if they are not strong believers. It is... Most people are out of God's protection. It's basic.\r\n                            54:16\r\n                            And it takes discipline, strength and worshipping God, practicing in order to be protected.\r\n                            54:25\r\n                            Remember the verses in Sura 41. It gives you the conditions of being in God's protection.\r\n                            54:35\r\n                            Page 480. Verse 30. It says,\r\n                            54:42\r\n                            [41:30] Those who say: \"Our Lord is GOD,\"... We say \"our Lord is God alone.\" But that's not all.\r\n                            54:48\r\n                            [41:30] ....then lead a righteous life,... So, it takes discipline and work, worshipping God, the Five daily Prayers.\r\n                            54:57\r\n                            In fact, when you miss a Prayer, you're out of God's protection even though you're a believer.\r\n                            55:02\r\n                            When you miss a Prayer, you're out of God's protection but God puts limits though on how much you pay, how hard the pinch is. We learn this very well from the Old Testament and the Quran\r\n                            55:17\r\n                            that God puts limits on the jinns, Satan, your enemies. So that you don't get more of a pinch than you deserve. So, when you miss a Prayer, you get a pinch.\r\n                            55:31\r\n                            This is how we come to realize that God runs the world, controls everything. A woman: About the witchcraft, isn't it when you give credit, like, to stuff like the evil eye, I mean, I think people actually help burning incense for evil eye, like,...\r\n                            55:53\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: This is all over the Middle East. Yes. A woman: I mean, come on, this is (unintelligible)\r\n                            56:02\r\n                            It's kind of like witchcraft but you're giving the jinns the credit (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: You are absolutely right, and he knows that, too.\r\n                            56:09\r\n                            A woman: Oh, yeah, he knows that but (unintelligible). I thought they were crazy by burning incense, I'm like, (unintelligible) the baby. \"What are you doing?\"\r\n                            56:16\r\n                            A woman: And he's like \"no.\" He didn't (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Right. Yes. Dr. Khalifa: It's funny how they... this is all over the world. They believe that. Yeah, all kinds of strange things\r\n                            56:25\r\n                            A woman: Yeah, (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: It had to be seven times, did you count?\r\n                            56:33\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: I'm sure they did it seven times anyway. Then, they took the baby. That was their grandchild.\r\n                            56:40\r\n                            Ok. The Ultimate Miracle: The Quran's Mathematical Code* 106.\r\n                            56:46\r\n                            [2:106] When we abrogate any miracle, or cause it to be forgotten, we bring a better miracle, or at least an equal one. Do you not know that GOD is Omnipotent?\r\n                            56:56\r\n                            [2:107] Do you not know that GOD possesses the kingship of the heavens and the earth; and you have none besides GOD as your Lord and Master?\r\n                            57:05\r\n                            [2:108] Do you wish to demand of your messenger what was demanded of Moses before? Anyone who substitutes disbelief for belief has truly strayed off the right path.\r\n                            57:17\r\n                            The... [2:106] .....Do you not know that GOD is Omnipotent?\r\n                            57:23\r\n                            When this miracle, this mathematical miracle, this long sheet on the wall over there, which is a very\r\n                            57:28\r\n                            tiny fraction of the miracle is just too awesome for words. And it's a very simple thing thing, but it teaches that God is Omnipotent.\r\n                            57:46\r\n                            I just, I can't describe it in words. How can you manipulate the numbers in this way? The physical structure of the Quran 114 Suras, every Sura is a specific number of verses.\r\n                            57:58\r\n                            And you put these numbers in any combination, and it comes out a multiple of 19. It's almost a physical impossibility.\r\n                            Followers of the scripture would want you to disbelieve.\r\n                            58:05\r\n                            Of course, it is not a physical impossibility because we see it, but for the humans and the jinns, it is a physical impossibility.\r\n                            58:13\r\n                            God's greatness is indescribable.\r\n                            58:21\r\n                            And God is telling us that those miracles of Moses and Jesus are nothing. God can bring better miracles.\r\n                            58:30\r\n                            [2:109] Many followers of the scripture actually wished to revert you, now that you have believed, into disbelievers. This is due to jealousy on their part, after the truth has become evident to them. You shall pardon them, and leave them alone, until GOD issues His judgment. GOD is Omnipotent.\r\n                            58:50\r\n                            Those idol worshipping Sunnis, for example, they would rather see you a Christian or a Jew or an atheist than what you are now, a believer.\r\n                            58:58\r\n                            They would rather see you disbelieve. And this was reflected very clearly when at the meeting in Los Angeles,\r\n                            59:06\r\n                            when this guy gave a research, a lecture, saying that the Quran was hallucinations of Muhammad,\r\n                            59:14\r\n                            and I stood up. I stood up and I gave the evidence that the Quran is from God.\r\n                            59:20\r\n                            Who did they attack? Actually, they're same people who are meeting in Chicago next week. They attacked me. They didn't attack the other guy who said \"the Quran is hallucination.\"\r\n                            59:29\r\n                            They attacked the guy who says \"the Quran is from God.\" They would rather see me say \"the Quran is hallucination of Muhammad.\"\r\n                            59:40\r\n                            So, the Quran is really accurate in describing them. 110.\r\n                            59:47\r\n                            This is a commandment to you and me. [2:110] You shall observe the Contact Prayers (Salat) and give the obligatory charity (Zakat). Any good you send forth on behalf of your souls,...\r\n                            59:57\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: ...will end up in your, what is it, PRA? A woman: PRA. Dr. Khalifa: PRA. Post Retirement Account.\r\n                            1:00:03\r\n                            [2:110] ....you will find it at GOD. GOD is seer of everything you do.\r\n                            1:00:10\r\n                            Now, I know for a fact that it takes time to complete, to do the Contact Prayers, all five of them.\r\n                            1:00:24\r\n                            But be sure you go, you move forward, you always move forward. For example, you may start by doing the Morning Prayer, especially the young people. You may start by doing the Morning Prayer, only.\r\n                            1:00:37\r\n                            But be sure that you move forward, not backwards. So next time, you do the Noon... the Morning and the Night Prayer.\r\n                            1:00:44\r\n                            That's two of them, for a while, for a few months, maybe. And don't be discouraged that you cannot do the others. Then, you do the Morning, the Night, and the Noon.\r\n                            1:00:54\r\n                            As long as you keep growing, you'll do alright, but don't hear this commandment and ignore it.\r\n                            Observing Salat – “Muslims” says Jews and Christians will not go to heaven. Jews and Christians lost Salat.\r\n                            1:01:05\r\n                            [2:110] You shall observe the Contact Prayers (Salat) and give the obligatory charity (Zakat).\r\n                            1:01:12\r\n                            You can't keep ignoring it. This is God ordering you to do this, the Five Prayers.\r\n                            1:01:21\r\n                            This is really the minimum that we can do. And it helps you a lot. You come a long way towards having God as your god. Just the Five Prayers and you come a long way.\r\n                            1:01:34\r\n                            And as I mentioned repeatedly before, God wants the strong and the disciplined in His Kingdom. He does not want the lazy ones.\r\n                            1:01:42\r\n                            God wants the strong and the disciplined who can do the Five Prayers. You must force your body to do the Five Prayers every day. If you're not doing them, you're not being fair to yourself.\r\n                            1:01:54\r\n                            You're suffering too much, unnecessarily, because everything will be straighted in your life if you do the Five Prayers.\r\n                            1:02:03\r\n                            And you must be hard on yourself. Put your \"self\" on trial and tell yourself \"you are bad, self. You must do the Five Prayers. Why don't you do the Five Prayers?\"\r\n                            1:02:14\r\n                            You must keep after your self, until you do, carry out this commandment, 110.\r\n                            1:02:22\r\n                            But don't let Satan discourage you, as I said. As long as you move forward.\r\n                            1:02:29\r\n                            [2:110] You shall observe the Contact Prayers (Salat) and give the obligatory charity (Zakat).\r\n                            1:02:34\r\n                            And this is, the rest of the verse tells us that this is what you're depositing in your PRA.\r\n                            1:02:39\r\n                            This is what you benefit now. You receive interest now, fringe benefits.\r\n                            1:02:48\r\n                            [2:110] ....Any good you send forth on behalf of your souls, you will find it at GOD. GOD is seer of everything you do.\r\n                            1:02:54\r\n                            111. [2:111] They said, \"No one will enter Paradise unless he is Jewish or Christian!\" Such is wishful thinking on their part. Say, \"Show us your proof, if you are truthful.\"\r\n                            1:03:07\r\n                            And the Muslims, so called Muslims, fall in the same trap. They say \"the Jews and the Christians will not go to Heaven.\"\r\n                            1:03:15\r\n                            Well, the Quran tells us otherwise. It is... anyone who worships God alone will make it to Heaven.\r\n                            1:03:22\r\n                            The criterion is to worship God alone. There's a book circulating in the United States now\r\n                            1:03:29\r\n                            that was written in Saudi Arabia. And in it, they say \"if you meet a Christian or a Jew, you must ask them to repent. If they don't repent, you must kill them.\"\r\n                            1:03:40\r\n                            This is in the book. Yes.\r\n                            1:03:45\r\n                            It's a book entitled \"the Muslims believe.\" Imagine that.\r\n                            1:03:53\r\n                            It's unbelievable, right? I mean, I don't blame you if you don't believe me. But this is true. You can come and read it for yourself. I have it. I have the review of it on my desk.\r\n                            1:04:04\r\n                            It's incredible. Edip: Doctors. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Both of them. Yes.\r\n                            1:04:10\r\n                            Edip: Doctors. The translator and the writer are both doctors from WAMY, World Assembly of Muslim Youth.\r\n                            1:04:20\r\n                            Edip: I was a member of WAMY. Dr. Khalifa: You were?\r\n                            1:04:25\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Edip used to be a member of WAMY. Don't worry. We all were.\r\n                            1:04:38\r\n                            Edip: Ahmad (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Yes, of course. He was the first president of... Edip: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: I know him very well.\r\n                            1:04:47\r\n                            112, [2:112] Indeed,... Here's the answer. [2:112] ...those who devote themselves absolutely to GOD...\r\n                            1:04:54\r\n                            And it doesn't tell you if it's a Hindu or a Buddhist or a Muslim or what. [2:112] ....those who devote themselves absolutely to GOD alone, while leading a righteous life, will receive their recompense from their Lord; they have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve.*\r\n                            1:05:08\r\n                            This is similar to the verse 62 that names names says \"the Jews, the Christians, the converts, the Muslims, any of them, who devotes\r\n                            1:05:19\r\n                            themselves absolutely to God and lead a righteous life, they will receive the recompense from their Lord. They have nothing to fear nor will they grieve.\"\r\n                            1:05:26\r\n                            The advantage that you have over the Jew or the Christian is that they lost the Contact Prayer.\r\n                            1:05:33\r\n                            You have the Contact Prayer. You have the complete message from God and you have the complete practices. Nothing was lost.\r\n                            1:05:39\r\n                            So, the difference is that it's like a person who's going to Boulder, Colorado without a map and a person who's going with a map. You have a map.\r\n                            1:05:56\r\n                            A woman: But they don't have the right map. Dr. Khalifa: They have a map from 1800. They don't even have the map. They lost it. Sura 19.\r\n                            1:06:03\r\n                            So, God says \"He will give them credit for any worship that they do but it is the hard way. It takes longer. They don't grow at the same as you do.\r\n                            1:06:13\r\n                            Because what you're following... did you see the mathematical coding of Al-Fãtehah? They don't have Al-Fãtehah. God gave us this and it causes you to grow much faster, more efficiently.\r\n                            1:06:23\r\n                            But they're still... they get credit for worshiping God alone.\r\n                            1:06:35\r\n                            113. [2:113] The Jews said, \"The Christians have no basis,\" while the Christians said, \"The Jews have no basis.\" Although they both read the scripture.\r\n                            1:06:45\r\n                            Not the same scripture. Both of them read the scripture. [2:113] ...those who possess no knowledge have uttered the same kind of utterances. GOD will judge them all on the Day of Resurrection, regarding their disputes.\r\n                            1:06:58\r\n                            What does this say? It says, [2:113] The Jews said, \"The Christians have no basis.\" The Christians said, \"The Jews have no basis.\" Even though both read the scripture.\r\n                            1:07:06\r\n                            So, God is saying that you can reach God through either way as long as you or they worship God alone, devote yourself to God alone and lead a righteous life.\r\n                            1:07:18\r\n                            Did you say something? Edip: I said \"those who possess no knowledge have uttered the same kind of utterances.\" They're just Muslims today.\r\n                            1:07:24\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yes, exactly.\r\n                            1:07:30\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yes, sir?\r\n                            1:07:40\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yes, a few, quite a few. In fact, we passed... maybe coming up, and we passed a couple of them.\r\n                            1:08:08\r\n                            113. 114. You Shall Frequent the Mosques\r\n                            1:08:13\r\n                            This is why we are here. [2:114] Who are more evil than those who boycott GOD's mosques, where His name is commemorated, and contribute to their desertion? These ought not to enter therein except fearfully. They have incurred humiliation in this life, and severe retribution in the Hereafter.\r\n                            1:08:32\r\n                            So, we must encourage each other to frequent the mosque. The Quranic study is a perfect example. Of course, the people who need this advice are not here.\r\n                            1:08:44\r\n                            115 [2:115] To GOD belongs the east and the west; wherever you go there will be the face of GOD. GOD is Omnipresent, Omniscient.\r\n                            1:08:57\r\n                            You must also observe God wherever you may be,\r\n                            1:09:02\r\n                            in addition to coming to the mosque. Gross Blasphemy [2:116] They said, \"GOD has begotten a son!\" Be He glorified; never! To Him belongs everything in the heavens and the earth; all are subservient to Him.\r\n                            1:09:16\r\n                            Of course as we increase, our knowledge increases and we realize how vast our universe is,\r\n                            1:09:22\r\n                            and how vast the other universes are and that they're all in God's hand. With this knowledge, we realize how ridiculous such a statement is.\r\n                            1:09:34\r\n                            It's like... it's not even like that, but it's like saying \"you're the father of a virus. Here's your son.\r\n                            1:09:41\r\n                            Go find an electronic microscope to see him, your dear son.\"\r\n                            1:09:51\r\n                            \"Don't you love your son? Right here, at the tip of my finger,\" there are a few viruses probably.\r\n                            Attains certainty one can see miracles.\r\n                            1:10:01\r\n                            So ridiculous.\r\n                            1:10:06\r\n                            [2:117] He is the Initiator of the heavens and the earth: to have anything done, He simply says to it, \"Be,\" and it is.\r\n                            1:10:13\r\n                            [2:118] Those who possess no knowledge have said, \"If only GOD could speak to us, or some miracle could come to us!\" Others before them have uttered the same kind of utterances; their minds are similar. We do manifest the miracles for those who have attained certainty.\r\n                            1:10:32\r\n                            This is a very important principle. When you attain certainty, you see miracles.\r\n                            1:10:39\r\n                            119 [2:119] We have sent you* with the truth as a bearer of good news, as well as a warner. And you are not answerable for those who have incurred Hell.\r\n                            1:10:52\r\n                            I'm going to stop right here. Dr. Sabahi, are you gonna take the Quranic study next week?\r\n                            1:10:59\r\n                            Did you say only one? Huh? Okay. You don't wanna take the Quranic study as well?\r\n                            1:11:07\r\n                            Oh, you will not be here? Oh, okay.\r\n                            1:11:14\r\n                            Where is Laurie? You didn't come last week, right? You did?\r\n                            1:11:19\r\n                            Oh, I thought you had a football game or something.\r\n                            1:11:26\r\n                            In fact, I meant to call you the next morning. Then, I forgot.\r\n                            1:11:31\r\n                            Oh, okay. I thought I asked a few people, but anyway. So, Laurie will give us the Quranic study next week, IN SHAA ALLAH.\r\n                            1:11:49\r\n                            Are there any questions before we close this study?\r\n                            1:11:56\r\n                            It's okay, any general questions.\r\n                            1:12:07\r\n                            Was it the... Yes, it is Divine.\r\n                            1:12:12\r\n                            And it is Barã'ah (Ultimatum). No. It was Barã'ah until about a hundred years ago, when they changed it.\r\n                            1:12:23\r\n                            So, what I'm doing here is taking everything back to the original, including the names of the Suras. The names of the Suras are Divine.\r\n                            1:12:33\r\n                            No, I didn't need to, because it is known actually equally as Barã'ah and Tawbah, so I didn't need to, I didn't.\r\n                            1:12:45\r\n                            It probably does, probably does. But we're not aware yet of it. Because the names must stay the way they came down.\r\n                            1:13:02\r\n                            Let me see. The numbers of the Suras, yes. But the names...\r\n                            1:13:08\r\n                            Edip: I have some significant news, but it's not all about the Suras.\r\n                            1:13:14\r\n                            Edip: There are some Suras that the names of the Suras are related with some very interesting news. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            1:13:20\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: I'm sure there are... I'm sure there will be, because everything in the Quran is mathematically coded.\r\n                            1:13:25\r\n                            So far we don't have anything established yet. Edip: But this Sura, according to also traditional knowledge, also has two names.\r\n                            1:13:35\r\n                            It is Tawbah or Barã'ah. Some people use Barã'ah, but it's also Barã'ah.\r\n                            1:13:41\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yes, it is well known as Barã'ah and Tawbah, but Tawbah is a strange name. It's a foreign name.\r\n                            1:13:46\r\n                            In fact, I see it here. We should have changed that to Arabic. Sorry about that. Yes.\r\n                            1:13:53\r\n                            In the next edition, I will change this Arabic name also to Barã'ah.\r\n                            1:14:03\r\n                            Yes. I'm sure there is some mathematical basis for it. That's a good question.\r\n                            1:14:08\r\n                            The names of the Suras were divinely inspired. This is why this is The Heifer (Al-Baqarah), for example, and not anything else.\r\n                            1:14:16\r\n                            Even though there are many important subjects in this Sura. But if you look at the old books, all of them say \"Barã'ah,\" up to 100 years ago.\r\n                            1:14:27\r\n                            Then, this name Tawbah started to appear in less than 100-year-old books.\r\n                            1:14:36\r\n                            Any other questions? Well, let us... We're celebrating Apamea's birthday today.\r\n                            1:14:46\r\n                            Edip: Did she born in two days? Dr. Khalifa: Well, her birthday was in the middle of the week, so she gets two Fãtehahs.\r\n                            1:14:54\r\n                            Edip: Mã Shã Allãh Dr. Khalifa: Also, it's a good excuse to have some cake.\r\n                            1:15:00\r\n                            It's nobody's birthday until... October 12 is Gatut, this year.\r\n                            1:15:07\r\n                            The next birthday is October 12. That's Gatut. So,...\r\n                            1:15:13\r\n                            You didn't know that, did you?\r\n                            1:15:19\r\n                            Yes. Yes. You want it for what? I forgot.\r\n                            1:15:26\r\n                            Very good. Ok, this is Al-Fãtehah for Frank's trip. He have a good one. And Al-Fãtehah for Apamea that may God give her a very happy year coming up.\r\n                            1:15:36\r\n                            And maybe a little one at the end of that year. IN SHAA ALLAh\r\n                            1:15:44\r\n                            And every year to be even happier, every year after that. Al-Fãtehah\r\n                            1:15:49\r\n                            Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem (1:1) Al hamdu Lillahi Rabbil ‘Alameen (1:2) Arrahman Arraheem (1:3) Maliki Yawm Eddeen (1:4) Eyyaka Na’abudu Wa Eyyaka Nasta’aeen (1:5) Ehdina Al-Serata Al-Mustaqeem (1:6) Serata Al-Lazeena An’amta ‘Alayhim Ghayri Al-Maghdoobi ‘Alayhim Wa Laddaalleen (1:7)\r\n                            1:16:07\r\n                            Congratulations. God bless you. Very fortunate. You're a fortunate believer. Mã Shã Allãh.\r\n                            1:16:19\r\n                            Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem In the name of GOD, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.\r\n                            1:16:25\r\n                            Congratulations for reading the Quran. And congratulations on starting with the new translation.\r\n                            1:16:35\r\n                            And I want to tell you right now that this was made obsolete before it came out of the press.\r\n                            1:16:44\r\n                            Which is a very great sign that we must be congratulated about. Because we are advancing faster than the press can work.\r\n                            1:16:52\r\n                            For example, you see, you see the title page, down this is \"Islamic Productions Tucson.\"\r\n                            1:16:58\r\n                            The next edition, \"The United Submitters International, Tucson\", for example, just to give you an idea of why this was obsolete before it came out of the press.\r\n                            1:17:06\r\n                            And throughout the translation, \"Islam\" would be \"Submission.\" And \"Muslim\" will be \"Submitter.\"\r\n                            1:17:12\r\n                            And the translation will be universalized.\r\n                            1:17:19\r\n                            It is not appropriate. This word, production, is not appropriate. Islam is Arabic. Production is English.\r\n                            1:17:29\r\n                            In Arabic, we call the Christian person Nasrani (نَصْرَانِي) But when you say Christian productions, you don't say Nasrani productions. You say Christian productions. The whole thing is English.\r\n                            1:17:41\r\n                            Also, this is a stage. You can see that God wants to put the whole world to test.\r\n                            1:17:51\r\n                            When the miracle of the Quran appeared first, the title was \"The Perpetual Miracle of Muhammad.\"\r\n                            1:17:57\r\n                            It was in Arabic \"(unintelligible) معجزة محمد\" And it was distributed as such.\r\n                            1:18:04\r\n                            I still have the labels as such, but the Arabs and the Muslims still do not understand the miracle.\r\n                            1:18:14\r\n                            So, it is not the current excuse that Rashad Khalifa has gone crazy or whatever excuses they used are not true, are not accepted.\r\n                            1:18:24\r\n                            They don't... Even if they say \"we don't accept this miracle of the Quran because Rashad Khalifa is crazy.\" They cannot do that.\r\n                            1:18:31\r\n                            Because, initially, the miracle was titled \"The Miracle of Muhammad, The Perpetual Miracle of Muhammad\" which is true because it came through the Prophet Muhammad.\r\n                            1:18:39\r\n                            God sent it to the world through the Prophet, in the Quran, and was there the whole time.\r\n                            1:18:45\r\n                            And still the Arabs, as you see from the last issue, mainly the Arabs could not understand it, were not permitted to understand it.\r\n                            1:18:53\r\n                            And then, it progressed. God willed that it progresses and it became universalized. It became just (unintelligible) the miracle.\r\n                            1:19:02\r\n                            And it didn't matter how they accepted it or not. Same with the first translation and with this translation, they cannot say \"this is off\", you see.\r\n                            1:19:12\r\n                            They can look on the spine of the book and it says \"Islamic Productions\" on there and also it says \"the Only Religion acceptable to God is Islam.\"\r\n                            1:19:22\r\n                            I mean, just go flip a couple of pages, see \"proclaiming one religion for all the people.\"\r\n                            1:19:30\r\n                            And you can see the translation in the first rectangle saying \"the Only Religion acceptable to God is Islam.\"\r\n                            1:19:36\r\n                            So, even though it is very clearly in harmonizing with their language, you will note pretty soon that they don't accept this translation\r\n                            1:19:45\r\n                            because God wants to prove something, prove their defiance, regardless of... Even if you agree with them.\r\n                            1:19:54\r\n                            Because even if you agree with them and you present the truth to them of worshipping God alone and upholding the word of God alone, they're just not having it in their hearts.\r\n                            1:20:03\r\n                            And God will not allow them, does not permit them, as we read in many, many verses in the Quran. God does not permit them to accept the truth.\r\n                            1:20:13\r\n                            In Sura 43, we're told that on the Day of Judgment, they will say to guardian of Hell \"Let your Lord finish us off.\"\r\n                            1:20:23\r\n                            And the Guardian of Hell, the angel of Hell will tell them \"No, you're gonna stay like this forever.\"\r\n                            1:20:28\r\n                            \"We have brought the truth to you, we have presented the truth to you, but most of you hate the truth.\"\r\n                            1:20:34\r\n                            Which is true, they really hate the truth. It is something that was incomprehensible.\r\n                            1:20:40\r\n                            How can people hate the truth? But it happens, they demonstrate it continuously, they hate the truth.\r\n                            1:20:47\r\n                            And they will hate anything to do with God, or anything to do with the truth.\r\n                            1:20:53\r\n                            And they want to stay away from it as far as possible. And this is documented in the Quran.\r\n                            1:20:59\r\n                            So, this is why, I'm just trying to explain to you why this was obsolete before it came out of the press.\r\n                            1:21:07\r\n                            It's also, every step of this book, every step was guided by God. And we had many, many signs that we'll be talking about in the future, from now on.\r\n                            1:21:16\r\n                            But I want to share with you the last sign about this book.\r\n                            1:21:22\r\n                            I was supposed to pick it up from the press on the 18th, Friday the 18th, which is the last day of the week.\r\n                            1:21:28\r\n                            And this was done 50 days before that time. We submitted the originals and they put the schedule and it was scheduled to be released on the 18th, which is the end of the week.\r\n                            1:21:42\r\n                            On the 17th, when I called, I said \"OK, I'm coming to pick it up.\" They were very apologetic and they said they will work the weekend because the book will be finished on the 19th, which is a Saturday.\r\n                            1:21:56\r\n                            So, this is another vital sign because there are so many departments.\r\n                            1:22:01\r\n                            As you see from the book, it's a big printer. It is the same printer that prints books for the University of Arizona Press and to some of the most famous universities around the country.\r\n                            1:22:13\r\n                            And there are many departments and every department has its own problems and delays and so on, but the book was finished on the 19th.\r\n                            1:22:21\r\n                            And on the 19th, I was in Washington, D.C. and I was driving with Ihsan.\r\n                            1:22:28\r\n                            I just decided to be a tourist. So, I went out to the tourist areas, Lincoln Memorial, Washington Memorial, the Capitol and so on.\r\n                            1:22:36\r\n                            And we were just leaving Lincoln Memorial, driving back to Ihsan's house.\r\n                            1:22:42\r\n                            And all of a sudden, all the license plates... now this may be superstition, but God gives us messages through our superstitions.\r\n                            1:22:51\r\n                            I want you to know this, too. From my experience, and probably you all had these experiences. If you were superstitious, for example, that if you wake up in the morning and see a butterfly\r\n                            1:23:00\r\n                            standing in the northern corner, northwest corner of your house, in the roof, this means you'll have a good day.\r\n                            1:23:07\r\n                            Ok. This is superstition. Then, God will speak to you through that superstition and you'll have a good day.\r\n                            1:23:12\r\n                            If God wants to tell you so, He'll send you a butterfly in the northwest corner of the roof of your house. That's what you know.\r\n                            1:23:19\r\n                            So anyway, about 1 o'clock on Saturday, 19th of August, and I was driving back from Lincoln Memorial, and all of a sudden\r\n                            1:23:28\r\n                            all the license plates around us, almost all of them were divisible by 19 on both sides people parked and in the cars parked on both sides.\r\n                            1:23:36\r\n                            And it was really a very strange phenomenon. I've never in my life seen so many divisible numbers of license plates.\r\n                            1:23:43\r\n                            I said \"what is going on? What is happening?\" I said \"what is this?\" And then we came to a street that is only about 6 or 7 blocks from Ihsan's house called Reed.\r\n                            1:23:53\r\n                            The street, the name of the street is Reed. And in the corner is Perpetual Savings. We have also two people from Washington, D.C.\r\n                            1:23:59\r\n                            Do you know the area, Gale and Mobile? Perpetual Savings on Reed Street, and the first car in front of us that's gonna turn left is number 114.\r\n                            1:24:08\r\n                            I said \"this is it. The book is being finished now. So, I'm gonna check with the press.\" I said \"this is it. It must be that the book is being finished now.\"\r\n                            1:24:16\r\n                            And sure enough, when I went there, I said \"I'm curious. When did you finish yesterday? You know, You worked on the weekend. I really appreciate it. What time did you finish?\"\r\n                            1:24:24\r\n                            \"Oh, between 1 and 2 o'clock.\" I said \"hmm, we knew that.\"\r\n                            1:24:29\r\n                            So, that was the last sign. So anyway, every step of this, when you find any typing errors or anything, you can be\r\n                            1:24:38\r\n                            sure that they are designed by God, because God creates loopholes for the disbelievers who insist on going to Hell.\r\n                            1:24:48\r\n                            And so every step of this book was designed by God. And this fits in with Edip's Khutba today, by the way.\r\n                            1:24:56\r\n                            If you find any, already Emily found a minor mistake where I forgot to put Arabic, the Arabic word next to it.\r\n                            1:25:09\r\n                            So, all these things are guided by God.\r\n                            1:25:15\r\n                            I think it is in the beginning of Sura 7. I wanted... The first verse I wanted to look at in the new translation is in Sura 7 at the beginning, or 6.\r\n                            1:25:27\r\n                            6 or 7. I'm gonna find out exactly the Sura... the Sura and the verse number.\r\n                            1:25:38\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Give me just a second. I'll find it. Right. Yeah. Edip: Definitely.\r\n                            1:25:43\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Sura 6, verse 9. Ok? Let's read it together. Sura 6, verse 9.\r\n                            1:25:55\r\n                            The top of page 129. Subtitle is \"Requirements of the Test.\"\r\n                            1:26:04\r\n                            And it says, [6:9] Had we sent an angel, we would have sent him in the form of a man, and we would have kept them just as confused as they are confused now.\r\n                            1:26:13\r\n                            So, that was Edip's Khutba today. God said \"Even if I sent an angel, I will send him in the form of a human being,\r\n                            1:26:19\r\n                            a goofy one, and confuse the heck out of them just as they are confused now.\"\r\n                            1:26:26\r\n                            So, it is a requirement that God... number 10 says, [6:10] Messengers before you have been ridiculed. Those who mocked them had incurred the consequences of their ridiculing.\r\n                            1:26:38\r\n                            It's because the disbelievers God creates these loopholes for the disbelievers to perfect it.\r\n                            1:26:44\r\n                            If God sends an angel, the whole world will believe. If there is an angel who is mighty and strange looking, has these powers and so on, what is the big deal? What is the test?\r\n                            1:26:57\r\n                            But we are fortunate in that sense that, that we are passing very difficult tests at very special times and I am passing them along with you\r\n                            1:27:07\r\n                            and telling you because more than 90% of the time, I am required, just as you are\r\n                            1:27:12\r\n                            to believe certain things that I did not know before in the past.\r\n                            1:27:17\r\n                            So, I know it is very difficult. In fact, I probably was the, the most lax of power among... there were many of you who may have more courage than me because for eight years I was a secret, a secret agent.\r\n                            1:27:41\r\n                            Even now I can't bring out the word. So, it is just as difficult. I realize how difficult it is. So, congratulations to all of you.\r\n                            1:27:48\r\n                            You're very... you're very fortunate people. Alhamdu Lillah. I know you know it.\r\n                            1:27:54\r\n                            Okay, we'll just take the book from the cover. A woman: I have a question. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            1:28:02\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Oh, we planned it this way for a long time. No. That's another good sign, you know, cause\r\n                            1:28:08\r\n                            Here, well, the first time we got hold of the new Quran, we were starting from the beginning of the Quran.\r\n                            1:28:18\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: ISBN. A woman: ISBN.\r\n                            1:28:29\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Oh, yeah. I see. Wow. Did you tell me this before? No, you already forgot it, but this is really something.\r\n                            1:28:37\r\n                            Yeah. The ISBN number, this stands for International Standard Book Number.\r\n                            1:28:45\r\n                            And it is a unique number that no other book in the world has it. So, I guess if you add 934894 plus 57 plus 1, you get a divisible number. We didn't plan it. We didn't design it this way.\r\n                            1:28:58\r\n                            Okay.\r\n                            \r\n                            \r\n                            20 Quran Study From Behrouz 1020 Sura 3 By M Sabahi Insurance Fear Worry\r\n                            \r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ We seek refuge in God from Satan\r\n                            0:05\r\n                            I ask God to keep him away from us. We are his prime targets.\r\n                            0:12\r\n                            Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem In the name of GOD, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.\r\n                            0:20\r\n                            We're on page 51. Sura number 3, starting at verse 10.\r\n                            0:28\r\n                            And our teacher is Dr. Mahmoud Sabahi.\r\n                            0:34\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem\r\n                            0:42\r\n                            As usual, I ask God to help me and all of us to understand that we are better and better every day.\r\n                            0:53\r\n                            If you don't mind, I would like to start from the beginning of the Sura.\r\n                            0:59\r\n                            For the specific reason of Aya 7. Aya 7 that we didn't get a chance to talk too much about it last night.\r\n                            1:08\r\n                            Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem [3:1] A.L.M.* [3:2] GOD: there is no god except He; the Living, the Eternal.\r\n                            1:18\r\n                            [3:3] He sent down to you this scripture, truthfully, confirming all previous scriptures, and He sent down the Torah and the Gospel\r\n                            1:27\r\n                            [3:4] before that, to guide the people. He sent down the statute book. Those who disbelieve in GOD's revelations incur severe retribution. GOD is Almighty, Avenger.\r\n                            1:41\r\n                            [3:5] Nothing is hidden from GOD, on earth, or in the heaven. [3:6] He shapes you in the wombs as He wills. There is no god except Him; the Almighty, Most Wise.\r\n                            1:54\r\n                            [3:7] He revealed to you this scripture, consisting of straightforward verses—which are the essence of the scripture—as well as multiple-meaning verses. Those who harbor doubt in their hearts will pursue the multiple-meaning verses to create confusion, and to seek different meanings...\r\n                            2:14\r\n                            [3:7] ...No one knows their true meaning except GOD and those who possess knowledge. They say, \"We believe in this—all of it comes from our Lord.\" Only those who possess intelligence will take heed.\r\n                            2:28\r\n                            I'll stop at this point. And the first six verses doesn't need much explanation because we have gone through it before.\r\n                            2:45\r\n                            The Sura starts similar to Sura second with Alif Laam Meem (A.L.M.).\r\n                            2:53\r\n                            And with the expression \"there is no god except He\" which is the major expression that we always use,\r\n                            3:07\r\n                            to make sure that we worship God and He is the god of all of us.\r\n                            3:21\r\n                            In 5, God is saying that there is nothing hidden from Him either on the earth or in the heaven.\r\n                            3:32\r\n                            And then in the 6, God gives us something that we can see, we can experience and understand\r\n                            3:43\r\n                            so that we know, we get a glimpse of the greatness of God. Then in 7, which I'd like to go a little bit into it and maybe discuss it because of\r\n                            3:56\r\n                            the importance of it and how it has been used.\r\n                            4:03\r\n                            [3:7] He revealed to you this scripture, consisting of straightforward verses—which are the essence of the scripture—as well as multiple-meaning verses.\r\n                            4:14\r\n                            First, what I would like to focus on is straightforward verses.\r\n                            4:23\r\n                            The reason I'm bringing this out is that this verse and these specific words are the topic\r\n                            4:32\r\n                            of a lot of discussions among the Muslim scholars all over the Muslim world.\r\n                            4:40\r\n                            Straightforward verses are the ones which are straightforward. The Arabic word is Muhkamat (مُّحْكَمَـٰتٌ), which there is nothing, no question about it.\r\n                            4:51\r\n                            You have to do the Salat. You have to pay the charity and things in that nature that\r\n                            4:58\r\n                            we saw it all through Sura number 2 which all of them were explained clearly, exactly that we know all about.\r\n                            5:09\r\n                            Then, God goes on saying \"these straightforward verses are the essence of the scripture.\"\r\n                            5:20\r\n                            The essence of the scripture, I tried to read about it and this is something that we can discuss a little bit.\r\n                            5:35\r\n                            ...is, what it is in English, the essence of the scripture, I don't know how strong it is to an English speaking person.\r\n                            5:44\r\n                            But in Arabic it says Ummul Kitab (أُمُّ ٱلْكِتَـٰبِ), which the literal meaning I think is the mother of all the books.\r\n                            5:51\r\n                            Can we say that? And then, we go to the multiple-meaning verses, which in Arabic they say Mutishabihat (مُتَشَـٰبِهَـٰتٌۭ).\r\n                            6:03\r\n                            These are verses that you can get confused or you can do the interpretation that you want to.\r\n                            6:13\r\n                            And then, God explains that those who harbor doubts in their hearts will pursue the multiple-meaning\r\n                            6:19\r\n                            verses to create confusion and to seek different meanings. This is the most interesting part of it because myself at least being a Muslim and being raised in an\r\n                            6:33\r\n                            Islamic environment, I can very easily, very soundly relate to this because this is\r\n                            6:42\r\n                            exactly what is happening. And we have felt it all throughout our lives, how these multiple-meaning verses\r\n                            6:54\r\n                            are becoming the essence of the scripture. And the essence of the scripture is put aside.\r\n                            6:59\r\n                            So, you see all the time an effort that is put into \"understanding the Quran\" is devoted\r\n                            7:10\r\n                            to the understanding of the multiple-meaning verses, the Mutishabihat (مُتَشَـٰبِهَـٰتٌۭ).\r\n                            7:15\r\n                            And then in that process, people completely forget about the essence of the major points of the scripture.\r\n                            7:24\r\n                            And with that they confuse the other people. And I don't have to go to specific examples of this, but you can see it everywhere.\r\n                            7:33\r\n                            I'm sure you can see it in other religions, but I have no idea of how those things are done, but\r\n                            7:40\r\n                            this clearly shows that how even Satan can use those multiple-meaning verses to divert\r\n                            7:50\r\n                            you from the major issue which are the essence of the book.\r\n                            7:56\r\n                            And then, God goes on and says \"no one knows their true meaning except God.\" Which is something that we have discussed and we know that He is the ultimate, the only teacher of the Quran.\r\n                            8:10\r\n                            And then, says \"those who possess knowledge.\" Who are the people who possess knowledge?\r\n                            8:17\r\n                            The... If you are a person who goes to a religious school, you become dressed in a specific case, in a specific way and then,\r\n                            8:30\r\n                            you spend all of your life dealing with Mutishabihat (مُتَشَـٰبِهَـٰتٌۭ) rather than worrying about\r\n                            8:36\r\n                            the major issues, does that make you a person that you have to possess You are the one who possesses the knowledge?\r\n                            8:43\r\n                            Or everybody else, or anybody can have the possession of that knowledge?\r\n                            8:50\r\n                            The Arabic word for this \"possess knowledge\" is Rasikhuna Fil Elm (رَّٰسِخُونَ فِى ٱلْعِلْمِ).\r\n                            8:57\r\n                            When this... Today, I was listening to Edip. Rasikhun (رَّٰسِخُونَ) I think in Farsi, at least the way we understand, is somebody who is seeking, who is really trying to find new things.\r\n                            9:11\r\n                            It doesn't matter if it is Quran or anything that you wanna find out.\r\n                            9:20\r\n                            And these are the people who are seeking, who are thirsty for the truth or to gain knowledge\r\n                            9:26\r\n                            about any issue, in this case about the Quran. And you acquire that knowledge by going and trying and seeking and reading and researching.\r\n                            9:44\r\n                            How much you do that...\r\n                            9:49\r\n                            I think I have a magnetic field for the children.\r\n                            9:54\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: On tape, there's gonna be whispers.\r\n                            10:05\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: So, this is interesting to see who are the people who possess the knowledge.\r\n                            10:12\r\n                            The people who can bombard you with all these Arabic verses, which I have firsthand experience of it.\r\n                            10:17\r\n                            Because if we dare to ask questions or raise questions about things that cross your mind\r\n                            10:25\r\n                            in school or in society, then those people who supposedly possess the knowledge\r\n                            10:32\r\n                            wouldn't be able to answer you. And they would resort to saying that, you know, you are becoming a disbeliever, you are becoming... you are questioning\r\n                            10:45\r\n                            God and all of these things. You know, when they didn't have an answer, they would relate directly that to God, that you are questioning God,\r\n                            10:52\r\n                            while God has all the answers. Thank God that now that I read the Quran, I find out that everything is here.\r\n                            11:00\r\n                            So, possessing or getting that knowledge only goes to the people who are, I use the Arabic,\r\n                            11:08\r\n                            Rasikhuna Fil Elm (رَّٰسِخُونَ فِى ٱلْعِلْمِ) the ones who are seeking to find the answers and they are after finding the true meaning\r\n                            11:17\r\n                            of the Quran. And then, God says \"they say, those people who possess the knowledge\r\n                            11:24\r\n                            [3:7] ...\"We believe in this—for it all comes from our Lord.\" Only those who possess intelligence will take heed.\r\n                            11:35\r\n                            Nothing to elaborate too much on this. Clearly, it says what it means.\r\n                            11:44\r\n                            I'll stop here and I would like to put it to discussion on this verse specifically.\r\n                            11:52\r\n                            If any additions or any subtractions or any, whatever could be done to this before I go to the next verse.\r\n                            12:07\r\n                            Edip: This is one of the most important verses and has been discussed on it and also\r\n                            12:15\r\n                            many times they use this against the miracle of Quran.\r\n                            12:21\r\n                            Because the Alif Laam Meem (A.L.M.) and these letters has been accepted by them as multi-meaning verses.\r\n                            12:31\r\n                            And they mistranslate this verse and by this way they say \"only God knows the meaning of these letters.\r\n                            12:41\r\n                            Whoever claims that he knows the meaning of these letters, they are liars and they are Munafiq. They are hypocrites.\"\r\n                            12:49\r\n                            And it is very interesting for me because this verse by itself has multi-meaning.\r\n                            12:55\r\n                            Now let's check. Look at the second half of the verse.\r\n                            13:01\r\n                            [3:7] ....No one knows their true meaning except God... Now in Quran, there is no full stops, comma, these kind of things or quotation mark.\r\n                            13:11\r\n                            Now, let's try to understand the puzzle or the multi-meaning of this verse.\r\n                            13:18\r\n                            No one knows their true meaning except God. Put full stop there now.\r\n                            13:24\r\n                            And then end, make it capital. Look at the meaning, just change the opposite.\r\n                            13:31\r\n                            No one knows... according to them, they stop in God. They say \"no one knows their true meaning except God.\"\r\n                            13:38\r\n                            Stop. \"And those who possess knowledge, they say we believe in this.\" According to them, those who possess knowledge, they cannot understand.\r\n                            13:47\r\n                            Because they full stop in God. And I discussed on this subject with them.\r\n                            13:53\r\n                            I said \"according to you, if you stop in God, the meaning just change in opposite.\r\n                            13:59\r\n                            But if you don't stop, if you pass, the meaning just opposite. Somebody can understand.\r\n                            14:07\r\n                            And what is your proof that you have to stop there?\" They said \"there is no proof but many 'Alim, many scholars agree on this subject.\"\r\n                            14:15\r\n                            \"Okay, now do you confess that this verse has two meanings, depends on your stop?\r\n                            14:22\r\n                            If you stop on God, nobody will know. But if you don't stop there, if you put comma, some people will understand, will understand, isn't it?\"\r\n                            14:31\r\n                            \"Yes.\" \"This verse has two meanings, has two meanings. That means this verse is by itself multi-meaning verse.\r\n                            14:40\r\n                            And do you claim that you know this verse? According to you, nobody knows multi-meaning verses.\r\n                            14:48\r\n                            Now, you say this verse by itself has a multi-meaning. And that means, according to you, you contradict with yourself.\r\n                            14:55\r\n                            You cannot claim that you know the meaning of this verse. You cannot speak on this verse.\"\r\n                            15:02\r\n                            And this was a very good discussion but I don't know how could I reflect to you.\r\n                            15:08\r\n                            And I want to give some examples because by examples it may be clarified.\r\n                            15:14\r\n                            For example, word Rasul, messenger, in Quran has multi-meaning.\r\n                            15:19\r\n                            One is, you can use this for prophets, also for messengers that don't receive books.\r\n                            15:25\r\n                            And they manipulate, they try to change the meaning of these words, Rasul (messenger) and Nabi (prophet).\r\n                            15:34\r\n                            And also, for example, word Nafs has double meaning, has three meanings in Quran.\r\n                            15:41\r\n                            Nafs, soul, yourself or your ego. For example, just in the beginning, they fail in the meaning of these multi-meaning words.\r\n                            15:54\r\n                            Edip: Words, For example, chapter 2 verse 50? Dr. Khalifa: 54\r\n                            16:00\r\n                            Edip: 54, they say... God says \"you shall repent to your Creator and kill your egos.\"\r\n                            16:10\r\n                            They... Other translation, they say \"kill yourself\" instead of ego. The word Nafs, they don't understand.\r\n                            16:17\r\n                            In fact, 30 verse later, God says \"you didn't obey Me, you killed yourself.\r\n                            16:23\r\n                            You didn't obey My covenant.\" And it just contradicts with 30 verse later.\r\n                            16:30\r\n                            But they don't understand. God exposed them by these multi-meaning words.\r\n                            16:35\r\n                            But people who have information, full information of Quran, they can understand which words according to text, in the text\r\n                            16:42\r\n                            has which meaning and they can understand better.\r\n                            16:48\r\n                            Thank you. Dr. Khalifa: There's one more thing, Edip. They can't explain why God put, and those who possess knowledge.\r\n                            16:55\r\n                            Why did God put it after? No one knows the explanation except God and those who possess knowledge because it's not necessary.\r\n                            17:04\r\n                            They put full stop after God, then it should be like \"no one knows the expression except God. And God is Omniscient, Omnipotent.\r\n                            17:10\r\n                            A man: Rashad Edip: Sure. Dr. Khalifa: Now, why did God say Dr. Sabahi: Yeah. Dr. Khalifa: No one knows the expression except God and those who are well-founded in knowledge.\"\r\n                            17:18\r\n                            Edip: Also, Rashad, the matter of belief, not information, God would say, none of the...\r\n                            17:29\r\n                            What's happening? Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible) gives a Chinese-Mexican dance.\r\n                            17:36\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: He's trying to catch the cricket. Dr. Khalifa: Those are seeing the cricket. Edip: And...\r\n                            17:48\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: By the way, these tapes go all over the world and the people know that there was a cricket in this room.\r\n                            17:56\r\n                            And it seems it was from Switzerland and Australia and I'm telling you.\r\n                            18:01\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: Go ahead, Edip. Dr. Khalifa: First thing, Behrouz tells Naghmeh, he met her. Behrouz comes in, walks down and says \"Hey, you and your sister go to the bathroom together.\"\r\n                            18:16\r\n                            \"How did you know?\"\r\n                            18:24\r\n                            It's amazing (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Ok. Who was, who was speaking?\r\n                            18:30\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: Edip. Edip: I already gave up. Dr. Sabahi: He gave up. Ok. A man: Come on. Dr. Sabahi: I think the cricket stopped him.\r\n                            18:36\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: He stole the show. Dr. Sabahi: One thing that I can add to what Edip said. If we look at 2:146, God says,\r\n                            18:44\r\n                            [2:146] Those who received the scripture recognize the truth herein, just as they recognize their own children. However, some of them conceal the truth, knowingly.\r\n                            18:55\r\n                            And 147, Sura 2, [2:147] This is the truth from your Lord; do not harbor any doubt it.\r\n                            19:02\r\n                            So, that could help to understand that people who can, have possessed the knowledge,\r\n                            19:10\r\n                            who can gain that knowledge. Everybody can do it.\r\n                            19:15\r\n                            And who you know better than anybody else, hopefully your children. Okay, if there is no... question?\r\n                            19:25\r\n                            Douglas: In the Arabic text, there is a Wa, which means \"and.\" But it's written very small.\r\n                            19:31\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, no, no. It's not very small. Douglas: There's another word... In other words, that Wa (and) is there.\r\n                            19:37\r\n                            In other words, I'm not saying that it was distorted. What they do, what they do is they ignore the Wa (and).\r\n                            19:44\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Exactly. Douglas: They ignore the Wa (and). Douglas: You see, the reason why I raised the question is because we are told in the Quran that\r\n                            19:53\r\n                            the people who are misguided, the unbelievers, that Allah will cause them to see what they wanna see in the verses.\r\n                            20:01\r\n                            And they will, they will, in their minds, say that the Wa (and) is not present.\r\n                            20:09\r\n                            And I think that's critical. That's critical in terms of the interpretation of the verse.\r\n                            20:17\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Good point. Behrouz: The end of verse 7, it says, Ulul Albab (أُو۟لُوا۟ ٱلْأَلْبَـٰبِ), the intelligent.\r\n                            20:27\r\n                            And then in another verse, it is explained as the ones, Dr. Sabahi was asking, why, who are the intelligent.\r\n                            20:36\r\n                            It says \"the ones that they know and understand God.\"\r\n                            20:42\r\n                            Ulul Albab (أُو۟لُوا۟ ٱلْأَلْبَـٰبِ) Dr. Sabahi: Ulul Albab (أُو۟لُوا۟ ٱلْأَلْبَـٰبِ) Behrouz: ...and understand God. So,...\r\n                            20:47\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: The ones who believe. The ones who take heed, believe. Behrouz: But that, this express, explains the last part that (unintelligible).\r\n                            21:06\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: What God is saying instead of saying the negative, God is saying the positive. What God is saying is\r\n                            21:12\r\n                            \"those who disbelieve are very stupid.\" We have to be stupid if we disbelieve in God,\r\n                            21:18\r\n                            if we can't appreciate all this creation. So, God says \"only those who possess intelligence will take heed.\"\r\n                            21:29\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: Ok. (unintelligible). Yes. Farhad: In Persian, I know it. In Arabic, what do you think?\r\n                            21:37\r\n                            There are more books written on Muhkamat (مُّحْكَمَـٰتٌ) than Mutishabihat (مُتَشَـٰبِهَـٰتٌۭ). Farhad: more more arguments... Dr. Khalifa: Mutishabihat (مُتَشَـٰبِهَـٰتٌۭ).\r\n                            21:45\r\n                            Farhad: For example, how many I have seen books called (unintelligible), dependency\r\n                            21:53\r\n                            and three those of the book is the thoughts about how to eat, how to...\r\n                            22:00\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yes, Mutishabihat (مُتَشَـٰبِهَـٰتٌۭ). Dr. Sabahi: it's Mutishabihat (مُتَشَـٰبِهَـٰتٌۭ). Farhad: ...Mutishabihat (مُتَشَـٰبِهَـٰتٌۭ), or how to do the Wudu (Ablution) or... Dr. Khalifa: Muhkamat (مُّحْكَمَـٰتٌ) is to believe in God alone, do the Salat Prayer, Fast the month of Ramadan, pay your Zakat, perform Hajj.\r\n                            22:11\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: These are Muhkamat (مُّحْكَمَـٰتٌ). God is one. A man: These are not, these are not... God has clearly defined in Quran like...\r\n                            22:16\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Actually, this reminds me, you notice that the people who object to the Quran have a certain number of verses that they make up.\r\n                            22:22\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: Yeah. Dr. Khalifa: The Quran says \"beat your wife.\"\r\n                            22:28\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: They have certain verses. I mean, they leave the major things, the worshiping God alone, and leading a righteous life, and they bring certain,\r\n                            22:35\r\n                            mysterious or obscure verses that they totally misunderstand anyway.\r\n                            22:40\r\n                            A man: Without context. Dr. Khalifa: And this keeps them away. Yes. Dr. Khalifa: So, what Farhad is saying is that it is in more ways true. More books written about the\r\n                            22:52\r\n                            allegorical verses than the straightforward verses. Farhad: So, these are straightforward but Ablution is not straightforward?\r\n                            23:00\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, that's (unintelligible). Edip: But it is not the matter of straightforward or multiple-meaning. It is only,\r\n                            23:08\r\n                            how to say, addition and speculation on Hadith. Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible).\r\n                            23:14\r\n                            Edip: On Ablution, for example, it is very straightforward, but (unintelligible) is not something related with it.\r\n                            23:21\r\n                            (unintelligible) Farhad: But there are many arguments on that within people in Shia and Sunni. Edip: Because they don't accept Quran alone.\r\n                            23:27\r\n                            (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Yes, the wiping the feet or washing the feet.\r\n                            23:33\r\n                            These are centuries old arguments.\r\n                            23:39\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Douglas Douglas: I simply wanna clarify further what I was saying. I don't think it was clear. What I, what I was referring to is that the Wa (and), it shows how Satan can misguide one letter in the Quran.\r\n                            23:51\r\n                            One letter, the Wa, which means and, in their minds, in their perceptions, it has no significance, and that's what I meant.\r\n                            23:59\r\n                            That they can be misguided. Satan can misguide them with one letter, let alone a word.\r\n                            24:05\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Exactly, this is the case with the washing the feet or wiping the feet. One letter that decides that the feet should be washed. And they ignore that letter which is\r\n                            24:16\r\n                            wipe the... (بِرُءُوسِكُمْ) Wipe your hair, and this letter B makes it wash the feet, not wipe them.\r\n                            24:26\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: Okay, I'll continue, verses 8 and 9. [3:8] \"Our Lord, let not our hearts waver, after You have guided us. And shower us with Your mercy; You are the Grantor.\r\n                            24:40\r\n                            [3:9] \"Our Lord, You will surely summon all the people on a day that is inevitable. GOD never breaks a promise.\"\r\n                            24:47\r\n                            These two verses are like prayers that the believers should use to ask God to always help them\r\n                            25:02\r\n                            and guide them and ask for the mercy from God.\r\n                            25:08\r\n                            And the meanings are very clear, but this is something that we always have to, as Rashad frequently reminds us,\r\n                            25:17\r\n                            that you have to ask God all the time, don't be shy. You know, just talk to Him, ask Him, and remind yourself of Him.\r\n                            25:27\r\n                            These are what these two verses are. Verse 10,\r\n                            25:33\r\n                            [3:10] Those who disbelieve cannot be helped by their money or children, against GOD. They are the fuel of Hell.\r\n                            25:43\r\n                            [3:11] Like Pharaoh's people and others before them, who rejected our revelations. GOD punished them for their sins. GOD is strict in enforcing retribution.\r\n                            25:53\r\n                            [3:12] Say to those who disbelieve, \"You will be defeated, then gathered in Hell; what a miserable abode!\"\r\n                            26:00\r\n                            I'll stop. These three verses are related to each other.\r\n                            26:07\r\n                            It is, explains about the disbelievers and God is clearly telling us that those who disbelieve\r\n                            26:18\r\n                            cannot be helped. And you can see, a very... you know, every day in your life, you can see people who think their money or children\r\n                            26:30\r\n                            or whatever they have in this world can help them and they think they can use that against God.\r\n                            26:40\r\n                            But my experience is that even with those people that they think they don't believe in God,\r\n                            26:47\r\n                            if you try to pinpoint, tell them \"okay, okay, let's go down to the bottom of the whole issue.\r\n                            26:56\r\n                            Is there any God or not?\" People usually, when you get to that point, are not ready to say it.\r\n                            27:02\r\n                            There is some, some kind of, not all of, but there are people who would say it, but my experience is that this is the basic.\r\n                            27:10\r\n                            Even those that they disbelieve, there's something, it's like they are afraid of saying it.\r\n                            27:18\r\n                            And God is saying that, you know, these people are not gonna be helped by their money or children.\r\n                            27:26\r\n                            The example is Pharaoh and people before them that have rejected the revelations.\r\n                            27:37\r\n                            And God tells us how to deal with the disbelievers, that He's telling us that those disbelievers will be defeated and gathered in Hell.\r\n                            27:47\r\n                            And this is what their destiny is.\r\n                            27:54\r\n                            I'll go on. Verse 13. Believers: The Ultimate Victors\r\n                            28:00\r\n                            [3:13] An example has been set for you by the two armies who clashed— one army was fighting in the cause of GOD, while the other was disbelieving. They saw them as twice as many with their own eyes. GOD supports with His victory whomever He wills. This should a lesson for those who possess vision.\r\n                            28:21\r\n                            14. [3:14] Adorned for the people are such pleasures, as women, children, piles upon piles of gold and silver, trained horses, livestock, and crops. Such are the vanities of this world. GOD possesses a far better abode.\r\n                            28:41\r\n                            15. [3:15] \"Let me inform you of something that is far better than that: for those who lead a righteous life, at their Lord, gardens with flowing streams, and pure spouses. They rejoice in GOD's approval.\" GOD is Seer of His worshipers.\r\n                            28:59\r\n                            16. [3:16] They say, \"Our Lord, we have believed. Forgive us our sins, and spare us the agony of hellfire.\"\r\n                            29:08\r\n                            [3:17] They are steadfast, truthful, submitting, charitable, and meditators at dawn.\r\n                            29:15\r\n                            I'll stop at 17. Go back to 13.\r\n                            29:20\r\n                            We have quite often discussed it about how God protects the believers.\r\n                            29:25\r\n                            When you believe in God, as the verse that Rashad has continuously reminded us of,\r\n                            29:34\r\n                            those who believe, they have nothing to grieve, they have nothing to fear.\r\n                            29:39\r\n                            And this is exactly what it means. If you can, during everyday life, you can test yourself very easily.\r\n                            29:50\r\n                            Things come up. And if you find that fear or that grief in your system, I think it's a very good indication\r\n                            29:59\r\n                            that you are forgetting who is the, who is the one who is God.\r\n                            30:05\r\n                            And I think, at least for me, this is a great reminder that during everyday experience in life, you see this.\r\n                            30:17\r\n                            And if you practice it, you'll see that God always helps you. My personal experiences through my life has been that I have been in situations that nobody\r\n                            30:30\r\n                            except God could have saved me or could have helped me. And it has always happened.\r\n                            30:36\r\n                            I didn't know it. Now that I look back and see the things or the adventures or the situations that\r\n                            30:46\r\n                            myself and my family have gone through, we have been in places and situations that only God could have\r\n                            30:52\r\n                            helped us to be able to stay out of trouble or things in that region. So,...\r\n                            31:00\r\n                            And I think this is when God says that they saw them as twice as many with their own eyes,\r\n                            31:08\r\n                            it should be referring to a specific incident in history. I don't know what it is.\r\n                            31:15\r\n                            But was there a war or something that happened, which Rashad can tell us.\r\n                            31:22\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: This is... Dr. Sabahi: [3:15] \"....approval.\" GOD is Seer of His worshipers. These allegorical flowing streams and pure spouses that are used in here,\r\n                            31:35\r\n                            usually flowing streams are something that in nature, wherever you go, you see that it's beautiful.\r\n                            31:42\r\n                            It's just something that reminds you of the beauty of a place.\r\n                            31:48\r\n                            And pure spouses, I guess, I don't wanna go too far into this one, specific.\r\n                            31:54\r\n                            But again, this is a human nature that this is what people want.\r\n                            32:00\r\n                            So, God is using this. It's not telling us that you'll have a lot of water, H2O, and a lot of women or men over\r\n                            32:07\r\n                            in the Heaven. But to tell you how beautiful it is if you get there.\r\n                            32:14\r\n                            And at the end, God says \"God is Seer of His worshippers.\" So, if you worship God alone, He is the One who sees it all.\r\n                            32:23\r\n                            These people who are worshipping God alone, [3:16] They say, \"Our Lord, we have believed. Forgive us our sins, and spare us the agony of hellfire.\"\r\n                            32:33\r\n                            This is something that we should always remind ourselves to say and ask God for the sins\r\n                            32:41\r\n                            that we have committed in the past or may commit every day to be, be forgiven.\r\n                            32:48\r\n                            And God is Merciful, Gracious, and He is the Forgiver. If you are sincere in your asking God and God is the Knower of what is in your heart,\r\n                            32:59\r\n                            then you'll see the result.\r\n                            33:04\r\n                            And then in 17, God very clearly, God is describing those worshippers, those believers.\r\n                            33:20\r\n                            \"They are the steadfast.\" [3:17] They are steadfast, truthful,... They don't lie. They are truthful.\r\n                            33:26\r\n                            [3:17] ...submitting, charitable, meditators at dawn. which includes the Salat,\r\n                            33:32\r\n                            which includes the Zakat, which includes that you are submitting yourself to God alone and you are steadfast at what you are doing.\r\n                            33:40\r\n                            You don't... I use the word vacillate, or you don't go back and forth.\r\n                            33:45\r\n                            You are steadfast in what you believe and what you practice. I'll stop at here and, as they say, open the floor for discussion.\r\n                            33:57\r\n                            Any questions? Dr. Khalifa: I want to go to what you mentioned about no grief and no worry, no grief, and no fear.\r\n                            Dr. Rashad Khalifa explains topic of no “Insurance” can take years to come round. “No grief and no Fear”. Earth provides “food for the prisoners”.\r\n                            34:10\r\n                            Well, this seems to come up every time we do a Quranic study, as you noticed, because it is very difficult for us,\r\n                            34:17\r\n                            the human nature, it is very difficult for us to come through with this full confidence in God.\r\n                            34:23\r\n                            And I've noticed it over many, many years with many, many believers. They eventually come around.\r\n                            34:28\r\n                            But it's very difficult to talk them out of insurance, for example. They just don't have that confidence. It takes a long time to grasp that.\r\n                            34:37\r\n                            It is also, it takes a long time to use this criterion.\r\n                            34:42\r\n                            No grief and no fear. So, I want you to listen to me. I'm gonna repeat it again since God repeats in the whole Quran.\r\n                            34:51\r\n                            And it seems to float over our heads. So, just for the moment, including myself, I want to imagine that this is for you.\r\n                            34:58\r\n                            Don't let anybody or your companion tells you \"this is for somebody else.\" \"It is not for me.\"\r\n                            35:03\r\n                            I want you to, this is directed to you. If you have, if you grieve, grieve over anything you missed,\r\n                            35:12\r\n                            or if you're worried about anything in the future, you are not in God's dominion.\r\n                            35:18\r\n                            You have to apply this criterion to yourself. So, ask yourself if you heard me.\r\n                            35:24\r\n                            I'm gonna repeat it. If you're grieving over anything you missed, or if you're worried about anything in the future, you are not in God's dominion.\r\n                            35:33\r\n                            So, for heaven's sake, find out what is it that is grieving you because you missed something, you lost something.\r\n                            35:39\r\n                            Or what is it that is causing you to worry about the future. Find out what it is, get rid of it, get back into God's dominion.\r\n                            35:47\r\n                            A believer, a criterion of the believer is no grief and no fear. You don't have any grief. You don't have any fear.\r\n                            35:54\r\n                            Whatever situation you're in, you tell God \"Okay God, I'm a submitter. I accept whatever you have given me, cheerfully.\"\r\n                            36:02\r\n                            And underline \"cheerfully.\" Because God knows best. If you go apply for a job and you don't get it, you don't grieve, you understand that\r\n                            36:10\r\n                            this is, God doesn't want this for you for some reasons that God knows. He sees the roads ahead of you.\r\n                            36:16\r\n                            And He will pick out the road that is best for you. So, you must have that confidence in God.\r\n                            36:23\r\n                            And He runs everything. Remember verse 5, it says,\r\n                            36:28\r\n                            [3:5] Nothing is hidden from GOD,... It's a very black statement. [3:5] Nothing is hidden from GOD,...\r\n                            36:34\r\n                            Including minor affairs. And God guarantees the believers. The believers are God's people. They're in His domain.\r\n                            36:43\r\n                            And God is the Sovereign of the universe. And He sees to it that you have no grief and no worry.\r\n                            36:49\r\n                            So, if you have that, you're not in God's dominion. So, He lures you to find out why.\r\n                            36:56\r\n                            The second part I want to touch here is number 14. It says,\r\n                            37:01\r\n                            [3:14] Adorned for the people are the material things of this world,... Now, I want to remind you. I have an article by a good believer that I may put in the Perspective.\r\n                            37:10\r\n                            It's in my desk. And she describes us as prisoners of war.\r\n                            37:16\r\n                            We declared war on God billions of years ago. We are the bad creatures.\r\n                            37:21\r\n                            We are the rebels. We have been banished from God's kingdom out here. But we are having a chance.\r\n                            37:28\r\n                            This is halfway house to Heaven from Hell. And the pleasures we have in this world are the things that are given to the prisoners of war.\r\n                            37:40\r\n                            So, can you imagine the things that are for the good creatures in Heaven? I mean, these are, you know, the lobster and the steak and the filet mignon and the shrimp\r\n                            37:50\r\n                            and the apples and the bananas and the peaches. These are the food for the prisoners.\r\n                            37:57\r\n                            And they are adored for the people. There was another verse where it says that \"the disbelievers mock and ridicule the believers.\"\r\n                            38:05\r\n                            Because they're having these things. But in the Hereafter, it's gonna be the other way around.\r\n                            38:11\r\n                            Because these things that we have here, all these pleasures and good things, are ridiculous compared to the Hereafter.\r\n                            38:21\r\n                            Just think. This is the food for the prisoners of war. We send our best people, the astronauts, in space, and we give them food that you will not give your dog.\r\n                            38:31\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Right, Lydia? Lydia: Right. Dr. Khalifa: So, it's adored in the eyes of the people. And this...\r\n                            38:40\r\n                            We have to remember this. And God says in 15,\r\n                            38:45\r\n                            [3:15] \"Let me inform you of something that is far better:... Also at the end of verse 14, \"God possesses a far better abode.\"\r\n                            38:54\r\n                            Far better. These are the things for the rebels.\r\n                            38:59\r\n                            Can you imagine that somebody declares war on you, and you catch him as a captain, put him in prison. What kind of food will you give him?\r\n                            39:06\r\n                            Are you gonna cook your best food? Your best food? A man: Dog. Dr. Khalifa: Huh? A man: Dog.\r\n                            39:13\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Right. Dr. Khalifa: You give him dog food.\r\n                            39:19\r\n                            Except dogs are far better than we are. The new movie is called \"All dogs go to Heaven.\" Have you seen that?\r\n                            39:28\r\n                            Hollywood is learning, reading the Quran.\r\n                            39:36\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Are there any questions on this? A man: Yes, I have a suggestion. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Farhad: This verse 15, as you said before that, you know, they choose, you know, the verse, you know, beating your wife, and\r\n                            39:48\r\n                            the disbelievers choose on that and they try to mock you. Farhad: This also has been a tool at the hand of disbelievers. Dr. Khalifa: Right.\r\n                            39:55\r\n                            Farhad: You know, telling you that, you know, \"Oh, God promises you many spouses in the Heaven. Farhad: God promises you rivers full of honey and milk in the Heaven. What is this?\" Dr. Khalifa: That's right.\r\n                            Allegorical description of Heaven.\r\n                            40:04\r\n                            Farhad: That's mocking Dr. Khalifa: Right. Dr. Khalifa: Because this is close to verse 7, where the multiple-meaning verse is.\r\n                            40:10\r\n                            The allegorical descriptions. Because if you, if you want to describe your wedding night to a child that is 5 years old, 7 years old, how would you describe that?\r\n                            40:30\r\n                            You have to give the child the allegorical description. Say \"like eating candy.\"\r\n                            40:36\r\n                            Right? I'm sure you'll agree that your wedding night is a little better than eating candy.\r\n                            40:43\r\n                            But this is how you approximate it to the child because the child will never understand.\r\n                            40:50\r\n                            I mean, I find this is as the best example. Because it's something that only adults will appreciate.\r\n                            40:57\r\n                            The children can never comprehend. Edip: Rashad, (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: So, the same with Heaven.\r\n                            41:02\r\n                            It's something that you can never comprehend. There's no way God can describe to you.\r\n                            41:08\r\n                            As a matter of fact, this is why if you go to Sura 55 when God speaks to the humans and the jinns,\r\n                            41:16\r\n                            God says \"there's Heaven for the humans and Heaven for the jinns.\" Because for the humans, they like steak and McDonald's.\r\n                            41:24\r\n                            No, I mean... Depends on how old we are. But the jinns don't give a hoot about these things.\r\n                            41:31\r\n                            So, if God says \"Heaven is this and this.\" The jinns \"Oh, we are not interested.\" So, the Heaven's description is allegorical. Edip, you had a good idea.\r\n                            41:40\r\n                            Edip: Oh yes, I had other example, not so interesting.\r\n                            41:48\r\n                            Edip: Ok. The other example is this, Rashad. Edip: If you... Dr. Khalifa: Don't be embarrassed. Edip: Yeah, I...\r\n                            41:56\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: What is your allegory? Edip: If you can communicate with a baby in mother's belly, for example, doesn't know this earth, this world, anything,\r\n                            42:05\r\n                            he knows only very little space and he doesn't know light, also ocean and all this kind of anything that we have.\r\n                            42:15\r\n                            For example, if you want to describe that baby and this world, how can you describe?\r\n                            42:21\r\n                            You can describe about only the things that he knows, very limited things.\r\n                            42:28\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, you can even go back 4 generations and describe to your grandfather the TV.\r\n                            42:33\r\n                            Edip: Yes. Dr. Sabahi: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: And if he has a baseball bat, he will use it on you. He would think you're kidding, you're mocking him, and ridiculing him.\r\n                            42:42\r\n                            If somebody's sitting in Washington, I mean, watching this in Tucson. I mean, this is something real. This is something that we have now. Just go back 4 generations, try to describe that.\r\n                            42:53\r\n                            We're talking about Heaven which is billions of light years from here.\r\n                            42:59\r\n                            Notice, all Tucson is what, 20 miles and 100 years from town? Heaven is billions of light years from town. Try to describe that.\r\n                            43:11\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: Martha has a question. Martha: (unintelligible)\r\n                            43:20\r\n                            And I'm just wondering that it might not be possible to state that (unintelligible)\r\n                            43:26\r\n                            For me, it's like (unintelligible).\r\n                            43:33\r\n                            that I haven't understood. But I've also understood that what I need to do is, going from this, is just say (unintelligible).\r\n                            43:42\r\n                            I may not be able to (unintelligible). But He lets you know. So, it's almost as if both of (unintelligible).\r\n                            43:51\r\n                            One is that there are those who have knowledge, who have knowledge, but at the same time if you are not, you don't,\r\n                            43:59\r\n                            you don't just throw up your hands and say, \"well,...\" You know that 95% of it you accept, you know, but\r\n                            44:07\r\n                            (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: That's exactly what the verse says at the end. It says \"the believers who say we believe in it, all of this is from God,\r\n                            44:17\r\n                            whether they understand it or not. But they accept it and believe it first. Martha: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            44:24\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Back to Dr. Sabahi. Dr. Sabahi: Right. I wanted to add something to Edip's example of a child,\r\n                            44:35\r\n                            and not knowing what is going on in the world. I have seen very very grown ups that they don't know what is going in the world.\r\n                            44:42\r\n                            And an example was that, which is a little bit funny, one of the religious leaders got a chance to travel Got a chance to travel...\r\n                            44:52\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Get Aisha take her to the babysitter. Get Aisha take her to the babysitter.\r\n                            45:00\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Ok. Excuse me. Dr. Sabahi: ...got a chance to leave the country, our country, and go to\r\n                            45:06\r\n                            to Africa, and over there, I guess, they took him to a place that these tribes lived, and these tribes\r\n                            45:12\r\n                            didn't have anything on. They just were naked. So, this gentleman comes back and says\r\n                            45:18\r\n                            this is the true, the true life. This is what it should be, and these are the people\r\n                            45:24\r\n                            who force women to cover their hair, and, you know, they are so picky about how the women dress, but\r\n                            45:31\r\n                            he hasn't seen anything outside where he was. He goes and sees it and now he says \"wow that's the right way to do it, not the way we do it.\" But still they don't wanna do it that way in our country.\r\n                            45:42\r\n                            So, it doesn't take to be a baby not to know what is going on in the world. Ok, I go back to verse 18, the first pillar of Islam, God first witnessed\r\n                            45:49\r\n                            The First Pillar of Islam* [3:18] GOD bears witness that there is no god except He, and so do the angels and those who possess knowledge.\r\n                            46:00\r\n                            Again, who possess knowledge. About people who possess knowledge. [3:18] ....He is the absolute god; there is no god except He, the Almighty, the Wise.\r\n                            46:11\r\n                            [3:19] The only religion approved by GOD is \"Islam.\" Those who received the scripture dispute this fact, knowingly. This is due to jealousy on their part. For those who reject GOD's revelations, GOD is most strict in reckoning.\r\n                            46:28\r\n                            20, [3:20] If they argue with you, then say, \"I have submitted myself to GOD; Me and those who follow me.\" And say to those who received the scripture, as well as those who did not receive any scripture, \"Do you accept Islam as your religion?\" If they do accept Islam, then they are guided. If they turn away, then your sole mission is to deliver the message. GOD is Seer of all the people.\r\n                            46:59\r\n                            I go back to 18. I remember last time I asked the question \"how many times this sentence\r\n                            47:08\r\n                            \"there is no god except He\" is repeated in Quran?\" Up to that point, there was two. And right away in this verse, there are two more of them.\r\n                            47:17\r\n                            I don't know how many more are after it. But clearly, God is telling us\r\n                            47:27\r\n                            who are the ones who are able to say \"La Elaha Ella Allah.\" There is no god except He,\r\n                            47:33\r\n                            and don't add anything after it. He says \"the angels, God Himself\" is bearing witness to the fact\r\n                            47:41\r\n                            and then in addition to God, \"the angels, and the people who possess the knowledge.\"\r\n                            47:48\r\n                            Again, the same thing that was in verse 7.\r\n                            47:54\r\n                            So, these are the, these are the only people who can say this, this sentence without adding or subtracting anything from it.\r\n                            48:06\r\n                            \"He is the Absolute God.\" Again, \"there is no god except He, the Almighty, the Wise.\" And two of\r\n                            48:15\r\n                            the names of God, the Almighty and the Wise are after it. So, this is a very strong verse, clearly,\r\n                            48:22\r\n                            showing that there is no god except He, and for the believers and people who possess knowledge, this is the main pillar of Islam.\r\n                            48:33\r\n                            I have one question myself. In the translation of \"He is the absolute god\"\r\n                            48:38\r\n                            the reason is that I read the Farsi book, that's... I think it's the translation for Qaiman Bilqisti (قَآئِمًۢا بِٱلْقِسْطِ)\r\n                            48:47\r\n                            which they have translated or interpreted, either literally or interpretation, that\r\n                            48:55\r\n                            \"He is the God that spreads the justice.\"\r\n                            49:05\r\n                            \"He is the one, the Just. And He is the one who\r\n                            49:10\r\n                            the justice is in His own hands. And He is the one who makes sure that justice is done all over the world.\"\r\n                            49:19\r\n                            which is translated \"He is the absolute god.\" I just wanted to see what is... what...\r\n                            49:27\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Well, I think I wanted it to mean justly and fairly and truthfully, He is the only god.\r\n                            49:34\r\n                            He is the only one that is truthfully and honestly and justly, equitably and fairly the one God.\r\n                            49:42\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: So again, the difference is that you translate this as, as describing what that god is. La Elaha Ella Allah.\r\n                            49:52\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: There's the whole verse (unintelligible). Dr. Sabahi: Yeah. Yeah. Dr. Sabahi: Ok. Ok. Dr. Sabahi: It's not saying any other attribute of God except that. In other words, for example, Satan wanted to be a god,\r\n                            50:02\r\n                            but it's not fair for Satan to be a god. It's not just, because he doesn't... he's not worthy of godhood.\r\n                            50:09\r\n                            God is the only one who is worthy of godhood. That's what this verse says. Dr. Sabahi: Ok. Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible) Edip\r\n                            50:16\r\n                            Edip: Can be Qaiman Bilqist (قَآئِمًۢا بِٱلْقِسْط) an attribute of Ulul Ilmi (أُو۟لُوا۟ ٱلْعِلْمِ)? They judge very correctly judgement. They have correctly judgment.\r\n                            50:24\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, this is referring to God. Qaiman Bilqist (قَآئِمًۢا بِٱلْقِسْط). Qaiman (قَآئِمًۢا) is God. Bilqist (بِٱلْقِسْط) means truthfully, and honestly, justly, He is the only God.\r\n                            50:31\r\n                            Or the only one worthy of godhood. So, I translated it as absolute god.\r\n                            50:37\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: Ok.\r\n                            50:42\r\n                            And 19, [3:19] The only religion approved by GOD is \"Islam.\"\r\n                            50:50\r\n                            And as you know [3:19] ...Those who received the scripture dispute this fact, knowingly. This is due to jealousy on their part. For those who reject GOD's revelations, GOD is most strict in reckoning.\r\n                            51:03\r\n                            Everybody, I think, here knows about how people react when you tell them about\r\n                            51:13\r\n                            the final scripture, and they dispute you. You can see this. You can... You have experienced this. And you see it every day in life.\r\n                            51:24\r\n                            And God is saying that \"this is due to jealousy on their part.\"\r\n                            51:30\r\n                            And God is promising that there is going to be a strict reckoning for those people.\r\n                            51:38\r\n                            20 is a verse which I find it very interesting, and I think it is something that we have to really keep in mind.\r\n                            51:48\r\n                            God is guiding us, telling us how to react to those people who argue with you.\r\n                            51:55\r\n                            This is God's words says. You know, if they argue with you or anyone who believes in the scripture,\r\n                            52:02\r\n                            and they dispute with you, God is saying, \"tell them, [3:20] ...\"I have submitted myself to GOD; Me and those who follow me.\"\r\n                            52:10\r\n                            And then again says [3:20] ...say to those who received the scripture, as well as those who did not receive any scripture,...\r\n                            52:17\r\n                            ask them [3:20] ...\"Do you accept Islam as your religion?\" If they accept Islam, then they are guided. If they turn away, then your sole mission is to deliver the message. GOD is Seer of all the people.\r\n                            52:38\r\n                            I've seen this, something relating to verse 20, and how you react or you argue or talk to other people.\r\n                            52:51\r\n                            Because those people who are aware of the scripture, and they believe that they are Muslims or\r\n                            52:56\r\n                            Christians or Jews, I haven't had any interaction with anybody other than Muslims,\r\n                            53:02\r\n                            somewhere in their heart, they believe that they are the ones who are the righteous, they are the right ones.\r\n                            53:07\r\n                            And they argue with you. And if you try to go too far, and try to use or try to\r\n                            53:18\r\n                            judge them, usually you lose the, you lose the major part of your intention. You lose the point.\r\n                            53:31\r\n                            God is telling us that you have to give them the message, and tell them that this is what I think,\r\n                            53:38\r\n                            this is what I believe, which is directly from this Quran. I'm not making up anything on my own.\r\n                            53:44\r\n                            This is what it is in this Quran. If they accepted it, that's fine. If they didn't, then I have no right to tell them that they are disbelievers,\r\n                            53:55\r\n                            they are gonna go to Hell Because this is not my... God is saying that \"if they turn away, then your sole mission is to deliver the message.\"\r\n                            54:05\r\n                            Because God is the one who leads the people to righteousness or to disbelieving.\r\n                            54:16\r\n                            And my personal experience is that when you get to such an argument,\r\n                            54:25\r\n                            usually the other people that talk to you, they pull you towards things are not the major issues.\r\n                            54:34\r\n                            They try to bring out the minor issues, and then if you play in their\r\n                            54:40\r\n                            ballgame, then you get lost into petty arguments, arguments, not the point that you wanna\r\n                            54:50\r\n                            raise and that's delivering the message that \"this is what I believe, and my belief is in Quran.\r\n                            54:58\r\n                            And one thing that I remember once we asked here from Rashad\r\n                            55:03\r\n                            about this point, that whether I can label someone as \"you are a disbeliever.\" There is another verse, we'll get to it, IN SHAA ALLAH,\r\n                            55:10\r\n                            that \"don't take friends among the disbelievers.\" How can I decide whether this guy is a believer or not?\r\n                            55:17\r\n                            If he says that \"I am a disbeliever,\" that's fine. But if you don't know, he thinks that he is a believer.\r\n                            55:23\r\n                            What was said that night was that any time, any day, God is the one who is\r\n                            55:30\r\n                            is capable of leading a person to righteousness or averting him from righteousness.\r\n                            55:36\r\n                            So, any day that can happen to someone. And I have seen it, even in the short period of time that\r\n                            55:42\r\n                            I have been exposed to the true Quran and have been reading it. So,\r\n                            55:50\r\n                            you have to be very patient. We have to be very patient. And we have to always keep in mind that\r\n                            55:56\r\n                            the sole mission is to deliver the message whether they take heed or they don't, whether they reject it or not,\r\n                            Spreading the message, Gradual release of the Miracle.\r\n                            56:03\r\n                            that is something that God is Seer of all the people. And He is the one who does it.\r\n                            56:10\r\n                            So, I stop here and leave it for discussions or questions.\r\n                            56:18\r\n                            A man: May I ask a question? What is responsibility of a believer? For example, I wanna compare a Muslim with the Christians and other sects.\r\n                            56:27\r\n                            I can see Christian missionaries go in the heart of Africa and spread the Christianity.\r\n                            56:32\r\n                            For example, right now in the places that war is going on in Nicaragua, right?\r\n                            56:40\r\n                            You will see, you know, all these nuns that they are in the heart of the war. But I don't hear a Muslim doing that.\r\n                            56:45\r\n                            And over here, you read that \"do not argue.\" What is my responsibility to spread the word of God? How can I spread it to other people?\r\n                            56:57\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Just telling, actually, there's the sole way of saying to the... say to those to...\r\n                            57:04\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: Yeah, you sole mission is... A woman: Where is the \"reminding?\" Dr. Khalifa: 20, it says [3:20] If they argue with you, then say, \"I have submitted myself to GOD; Me and those who follow me.\" And say to those who received the scripture, as well as those who did not receive any scripture, \"Do you accept Islam as your religion?\" If they do accept Islam, they have been guided. If they turn away, then your sole mission is to deliver the message. GOD is Seer of all the people.\r\n                            57:28\r\n                            A man: Do you invite other people, you know, to your religion and if they don't accept...? Dr. Khalifa: We deliver, we deliver the message all over the world. There are believers everywhere.\r\n                            57:36\r\n                            And they're believer in the message wherever they are. Keikhosrow is doing it in Atlanta and Behrooz did it in his area.\r\n                            57:44\r\n                            And he made the summary of the miracle and he delivered them to the mathematics department known college and university in the area and he went to the churches.\r\n                            57:53\r\n                            He wrote to the churches to 100,000 people all over us. In fact, he did, he carried out this verse correctly.\r\n                            58:01\r\n                            We have people in Australia, New Zealand, England, doing this. They're very active.\r\n                            58:08\r\n                            Wherever they are, it's... you can't help it. When you see a miracle like this, you see a treasure and you want the people to partake of it.\r\n                            58:15\r\n                            You're telling them everywhere. And of course, they are being ridiculed and... they're getting believers. Ihsan did it in Washington. Kathy did it in Atlanta.\r\n                            58:25\r\n                            She went to all the churches and she was shocked. They're not interested, are they?\r\n                            58:33\r\n                            Yeah, before she came here. So, she gave up in Atlanta and said \"I'm going to Tucson,\" where she is.\r\n                            58:38\r\n                            So, the believers do that. They deliver the message. And then, that's all they can do.\r\n                            58:45\r\n                            Robert Nadib sat at the university in the morning and delivered the message to a number of people.\r\n                            58:52\r\n                            Edip: And Apamea. Dr. Khalifa: I don't see Apamea. I see Naghmeh.\r\n                            59:00\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: And Apamea, too. A man: I have a simple observation.\r\n                            59:06\r\n                            In communicating the truth to people, naturally we need to be equipped\r\n                            59:15\r\n                            with tools. The tools, the best tools are the best words that can carry the true meaning out.\r\n                            59:25\r\n                            Since the word \"Islam\" in Arabic, as it was revealed to you that we should use the meaning\r\n                            59:35\r\n                            and carry the meaning to the people. My observation is that the reception is by far greater.\r\n                            59:42\r\n                            \"Would you submit? Are you a submitter to God? Do you believe in God? Do you submit to Him?\"\r\n                            59:51\r\n                            This is a door opener. Hardly you can find anyone who can dare saying \"I do not,\" unless he says\r\n                            1:00:01\r\n                            \"I'm an atheist and I don't believe in God.\" So, the word \"Muslim\" may introduce an element of prejudice.\r\n                            1:00:12\r\n                            Immediately say \"wow, you know, why should I?\" But the meaning, the meaning is carried forward, it is effective.\r\n                            1:00:20\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Ok. This is a very good point. I want to mention here that God wanted this message\r\n                            1:00:28\r\n                            to come here gradually. Even the miracle of Quran, at the beginning, it was titled \"the perpetual miracle of Muhammad.\"\r\n                            1:00:37\r\n                            And they still rejected it. They still turned it down, because God wants to tell them and show them on the Day of Judgement that even when it was called \"the perpetual miracle of Muhammad,\"\r\n                            1:00:46\r\n                            they could not see it. And because of their arrogance, they would not accept it. Also, the Quran now says \"the only religion acceptable to God is Isalm.\"\r\n                            1:00:57\r\n                            Islam was given a bad name by thanks to Khomeini and Gaddafi and Islamic revolutionaries.\r\n                            1:01:06\r\n                            In the new, in the final and official translation that I'm doing now, and IN SHAA ALLAH that's the one that will be printed by the millions.\r\n                            1:01:16\r\n                            It says \"the only religion approved by God is submission.\" And \"Muslim\" will be changed to \"Submitter.\" The \"Muslim Perspective\" has been changed to Submitter's Perspective.\"\r\n                            1:01:28\r\n                            But we are delivering the message. All of us are doing it automatically. Every one of you is doing it. I know that.\r\n                            1:01:36\r\n                            I think the luckiest ones have been Farhad and Mahvash. Farhad talked to his sister and Mahvash talked to her brother and they hit the jackpot.\r\n                            1:01:43\r\n                            Both of them believed. They're real believers. Of course, you've seen them. You've seen Abdul Hayy and Farbani, real believers. So, it's not always failure or ridicule.\r\n                            1:01:54\r\n                            We meet with success a lot. And now Abdul Hayy and Farbani are starting a nice group in Scottsdale.\r\n                            1:02:02\r\n                            Very nice group. Because they're doing it. Every one of us is doing this.\r\n                            1:02:09\r\n                            Look Masoud is lucky by meeting Naghmeh and Apamea.\r\n                            1:02:16\r\n                            A man: Mahmoud, Mahmoud. We know each other for 25 years. Dr. Khalifa: Mã Shã Allãh. And Malihe started the whole chain.\r\n                            1:02:23\r\n                            \"Here's a group. Ok. Let me go investigate.\"\r\n                            1:02:29\r\n                            And then she found... So, God guides in many different ways. And there is a lot of success.\r\n                            \r\n                            \r\n                            21 Quran Study From Behrouz 1121 Sura 9;52 By Rashad The Hypocrites Apology To Parivash Sura 56;75 B\r\n                            \r\n                            \r\n                            The messenger: In God the believers shall trust. In other words, if you're a believer, you must trust that God will take care of you. God guarantees it for you.\r\n                            0:13\r\n                            And if something appears to be bad,  you must know that there's a good reason for it.\r\n                            0:21\r\n                            [9:52] Say, \"you can only expect for us  one of two good things in war (victory  \r\n                            0:31\r\n                            or martyrdom) while we expect for you condemnation from GOD and retribution from Him,\r\n                            0:37\r\n                            at our hands... or at our hands. Therefore, wait, and we will wait along with you.” \r\n                            0:44\r\n                            [9:53] Say, “Spend, willingly or unwillingly. Nothing will be accepted from you, for you are evil people.”\r\n                            0:52\r\n                            Rejectors of God's messenger observe the Salat prayers. [9:54] What prevented the acceptance of their spending is that they disbelieved in GOD and His messenger, and when they observed the Contact Prayers (Salat), they observed them lazily, and when they gave to charity, they did so grudgingly.\r\n                            1:14\r\n                            This is an important verse. You should remember it, 9:54. Remember it. When the people tell you that \"we  \r\n                            1:21\r\n                            think that Salat began with Muhammad. We think there was no Salat before the Prophet Muhammad.\r\n                            1:28\r\n                            You should remind them with this verse. These  are people who rejected the Prophet. They disbelieved in God, but they were doing the 5 contact prayers. The word Salat is very specific.\r\n                            1:38\r\n                            Because Salat existed before the prophet. Just at the time, it had been... they had been corrupted  \r\n                            1:44\r\n                            by idol worship.\r\n                            1:51\r\n                            Exactly. Same thing today. 9:54 is another proof that the contact prayers (Salat) existed before the Quran.\r\n                            2:20\r\n                            Yes, this is a good point because this, this verse was revealed probably less than a year before the prophet's death.\r\n                            2:29\r\n                            And this is my chance to give Parivash a public apology because I misunderstood\r\n                            2:35\r\n                            her question yesterday. She was saying that  the the verse is at the end of Sura 15,\r\n                            2:41\r\n                            they are people who accept the Quran partially could not possibly be applicable to the the time of\r\n                            2:48\r\n                            the prophet because the Quran itself was being revealed. So, it was not in existence really.\r\n                            2:55\r\n                            Even when the Prophet died, they left the Quran in the  chronological sequence with instructions in  \r\n                            3:01\r\n                            the side was... is not organized at all into a Quran. Now, we have the Quran. This is the Quran  \r\n                            3:09\r\n                            the format that God wants, and did not exist until 20 years after the prophet's death. They decided to put it together.\r\n                            3:20\r\n                            Parivash: This is very... this only one verse is very very strong. It says proclaim to whom... proclaim the messenger... if messenger... that I'm messenger and after that...\r\n                            3:35\r\n                            The Messenger: (15:89) وَقُلْ إِنِّىٓ أَنَا ٱلنَّذِيرُ ٱلْمُبِينُ And say I am the... Parivash: One verse is enough to know that after Muhammad, a messenger comes.\r\n                            3:44\r\n                            The Messenger: Mã Shã Allãh. Yeah, I misunderstood the question.\r\n                            3:54\r\n                            The Messenger: 196, at the top, 55 says \"Do not be impressed by their money, or their children. GOD turns these into means of retribution for them in this life, and their souls depart while they are disbelievers.\r\n                            Disbelievers that look happy.\r\n                            4:10\r\n                            This is a common thing that you may come across \"Look at those people. They are not believers but they are happy and rich and this and that.\" But they are not happy. You have to take that word out. Because God says \"He  \r\n                            4:21\r\n                            will cause the money and the children to be to be the source of misery for them.\"\r\n                            4:31\r\n                            Then, after all this misery, they leave the world as disbelievers.\r\n                            4:38\r\n                            56, They swear by GOD that they belong with you, while they do not belong with you; they are divisive people.\r\n                            4:46\r\n                            They will create division. They'll create confusion because the statements that come out of their mouth is disbelief.\r\n                            4:58\r\n                            [9:57] If they could find [any] refuge, or caves, or a hiding place, they would go to it, rushing.\r\n                            5:03\r\n                            [9:58] Some of them criticize your distribution of the charities; if they are given therefrom, they become satisfied, but if they are not given therefrom, they become objectors.\r\n                            5:18\r\n                            [9:59] They should be satisfied with what GOD and His messenger have given them. They should have said, “GOD suffices us. GOD will provide for us from His bounties, [through] His messenger. We are seeking only GOD.”\r\n                            5:33\r\n                            And here's the distribution system   for charities other than ZAKAT. Those apply to ZAKAT.\r\n                            5:41\r\n                            [9:60] Charities shall go to the poor So, on ZAKAT, it says your parents first. They have to be poor. If they are not poor, then you go to the next line which is relatives, cousins, aunts, nephews, nieces, uncles.\r\n                            6:04\r\n                            [9:60] Charities shall go to the poor, the needy, the workers who collect them, the new converts, to free the slaves, to those burdened by sudden expenses, in the cause of GOD, and to the traveling alien. Such is GOD’s commandment. GOD is Omniscient, Most Wise.\r\n                            6:29\r\n                            [9:61] Some of them hurt the prophet by saying, “He is all ears!” Say, “It is better for you that he listens to you. He believes in GOD, and trusts the believers. He is a mercy for those among you who believe.” Those who hurt GOD’s messenger have incurred a painful retribution.\r\n                            6:47\r\n                            62, They swear by GOD to you, to please you, when GOD and His messenger are more worthy of pleasing, if they are really believers.\r\n                            7:00\r\n                            Retribution for Opposing God and His Messenger 63, Did they not know that anyone who opposes GOD and His messenger has incurred the fire of Hell forever? This is the worst humiliation.\r\n                            7:14\r\n                            [9:64] The hypocrites worry that a sura may be revealed exposing what is inside their hearts. Say, “Go ahead and mock. GOD will [bring out] what you are [worried about].”\r\n                            7:26\r\n                            [9:65] If you ask them, they would say, “We were only [joking and playing].” Say, “Do you realize that you are mocking GOD, and His revelations, and His messenger?”\r\n                            7:37\r\n                            [9:66] Do not apologize. You have disbelieved after having believed. If we pardon some of you, we will punish others among you, as a consequence of their [transgressions].\r\n                            7:48\r\n                            [9:67] The hypocrite men and the hypocrite women belong with each other − they advocate evil and prohibit righteousness, and they are stingy. They forgot GOD, so He forgot them. The hypocrites are truly wicked.\r\n                            Dr. Rashad Khalifa Talks about Hypocrites.\r\n                            8:01\r\n                            [9:68] GOD promises the hypocrite men and the hypocrite women, as well as the disbelievers, the fire of Hell, they abide [therein] forever. It suffices them. GOD has condemned them; they have incurred an [unending] retribution.\r\n                            8:17\r\n                            So, here we read four pages, most of the them about the hypocrites because they sit, sit with us and they... we look on them as believers and then\r\n                            8:27\r\n                            they talk to some of us and people listen  to them and what comes out, they cause doubt in the hearts of them\r\n                            8:37\r\n                            in the heart of the believers. But God reserves the lowest pit of Hell for them because of this.\r\n                            8:45\r\n                            Because they look like believers, act like believers. We have to be...we have to be aware as we grow. Just because\r\n                            8:56\r\n                            we're all here at the same rung doesn't mean we have to be perfect in our religion. This is a test   for all of us.\r\n                            9:07\r\n                            They could be very very loving  friendly people and, you know, they are with us and...\r\n                            9:15\r\n                            Then, they stab you.\r\n                            9:21\r\n                            Yes, in fact, there are many examples of this. They are with us and very strong. We became very close and very friendly but now we know they are not believers.\r\n                            9:32\r\n                            Cause things are happening progressively and there's a drop-out point for some people. So, even though they believe\r\n                            9:41\r\n                            when the messengership point came, for example, they couldn't take it. But they continue to come  \r\n                            9:47\r\n                            with us and talk with us. You know a few of them.\r\n                            10:10\r\n                            OK. We'll have 5 minutes of discussion.\r\n                            10:24\r\n                            Charity is something that don't stop. Storm could come and destroy San Francisco and the people on the street hungry and... you don't even know their names. You help them.\r\n                            10:39\r\n                            Right. Because it's limited by you and me by not being too extravagant. Go ahead.\r\n                            Zakat to Family who are not fighting you because of religion.\r\n                            11:12\r\n                            Yes, give the ZAKAT to the relatives first unless...unless he's fighting you. He's just disbelieving and has made a decision he doesn't know but he's not fighting  \r\n                            11:24\r\n                            you actively when you have to give the ZAKAT to the relatives first. God says that.\r\n                            11:31\r\n                            Because your cousin who's not fighting you, maybe next  week, he reads the Quran, discover God and becomes\r\n                            11:37\r\n                            better than you and me, right? And maybe when you  help him, this will cause him to believe.\r\n                            11:44\r\n                            He says \"wow, this is a good statement that believers are charitable.\" So, God tells us to consider them potential believers.\r\n                            12:11\r\n                            IN SHAA ALLAH.\r\n                            12:38\r\n                            He got the message from another source?\r\n                            12:44\r\n                            Oh, I see. Well, if the circumstances come up, we're supposed  to give the message, any way, when the circumstances come up.\r\n                            12:55\r\n                            God will create the circumstances for us to  deliver the message but we must strive. We need to strive. We need to do something.\r\n                            Believers Vs Strives. Loaning money.\r\n                            13:08\r\n                            You know, as it is the majority of people  believe in God alone, worship the Quran alone, worship God alone. And that's it. They're believers. They're good. They're going to Heaven. But they are not the same as  \r\n                            13:24\r\n                            people who strive who are just aflame. Hey, look who's here. The Turners are here. Come on in. Come on in. Mã Shã Allãh.\r\n                            13:51\r\n                            You left Omnia home.\r\n                            13:57\r\n                            ʿAlaykumu Al-Salam Kid sleep here in Tucson? Oh, OK. I know how it is.\r\n                            14:08\r\n                            Mã Shã Allãh.\r\n                            14:27\r\n                            Written down? If... if in your mind, you don't care if she keeps the money\r\n                            14:35\r\n                            and you never get it back, then it's okay.  But if you want it to be repaid, God tells us  \r\n                            14:43\r\n                            to write it down, so you don't forget how much you give her and she doesn't forget how much she borrows.\r\n                            14:49\r\n                            If you don't care if she ever pays it, then it's okay. This... this you write it down if you expect it  \r\n                            14:58\r\n                            to be paid back because I'm telling you you'll  forget. You may give her $500 and then after a  \r\n                            15:05\r\n                            month, you'll be absolutely positive you had given her 1000. Sometimes Satan will see to it.\r\n                            15:20\r\n                            The person who's giving the loan is in control. So, it is the person's right. But the person who's taking the loan is the one who dictates the terms or writes down, writes down \"I received.\"\r\n                            15:36\r\n                            \"I received $500 from Roxana and I promise to pay it $50 a month gradually and finish\r\n                            15:46\r\n                            the payments on a certain date.\" This is... God gives us the details of what to write. Because it'll be written in the hands of the borrower.\r\n                            15:57\r\n                            And then you have two witnesses. This is why there'll be no  confusion at all. Subhan Allah. I mean, this was... this came down at an age when there were no accountants.\r\n                            16:39\r\n                            Yeah, this is true in all countries and seems here also. No, but this is a specific situation talking about the community of believers. And we've seen it also within the  \r\n                            16:51\r\n                            community of believers.\r\n                            16:58\r\n                            We live... we are living the Quran.\r\n                            17:03\r\n                            So, why don't we finish question 9? As much as you can.\r\n                            17:16\r\n                            We're talking about believers who believe in God, the Hereafter, follow the Quran alone and worship God alone, but that's the extent of it.\r\n                            17:24\r\n                            They're good people. They're going to Heaven but they're not at the same rank, as far as God is concerned, like the people who, who strive.\r\n                            17:37\r\n                            Right. Yeah, right. You have to see all circumstances and how it is working, but God says\r\n                            17:47\r\n                            لَّا يَسْتَوِى ٱلْقَـٰعِدُونَ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ غَيْرُ أُو۟لِى ٱلضَّرَرِ وَٱلْمُجَـٰهِدُونَ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ بِأَمْوَٰلِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ ۚ فَضَّلَ ٱللَّهُ (4:95) ٱلْمُجَـٰهِدِينَ بِأَمْوَٰلِهِمْ وَأَنفُسِهِمْ عَلَى ٱلْقَـٰعِدِينَ دَرَجَةًۭ\r\n                            17:56\r\n                            God raises the strivers.\r\n                            Sharing the message “don’t chase them away” “keep the door open”.\r\n                            18:02\r\n                            So, I don't, I don't push unless this comes from the people who care.\r\n                            18:17\r\n                            Yeah. Yeah, you're gonna see to it that the message is delivered in the best possible and the most effective manner. It all depends on the circumstances. Again,\r\n                            18:28\r\n                            (16:125) ٱدْعُ إِلَىٰ سَبِيلِ رَبِّكَ بِٱلْحِكْمَةِ وَٱلْمَوْعِظَةِ ٱلْحَسَنَةِ Invite to the path of God with wisdom and great diplomacy.\r\n                            18:37\r\n                            You're gonna do it so you don't chase him away and you don't.... keep the door open. If they are not going to believe now, you keep the door open for them.\r\n                            18:47\r\n                            So, you're right. Yeah. Mã Shã Allãh. So, is it good? Good. Alhamdu Lillah\r\n                            19:44\r\n                            But there's a point of... where God asked us to  give up and then the question in Sura 13\r\n                            19:53\r\n                            so \"is it not time for the believers  to give up on the disbelievers and realize   that God guides whomever He wills?\"\r\n                            20:03\r\n                            Usually they catch it if God wants it one day. Somebody's gonna believe this. That's it. They see it. You can tell if they're blind and deaf or if there's a concrete wall around them or if they are wide open to the message.\r\n                            20:21\r\n                            I don't know. It's been rare to see somebody who's completely blocked and then all of a sudden they, they could see.\r\n                            20:30\r\n                            Well, Lisa and Susan go to work. Don't go through this door.\r\n                            20:35\r\n                            I think Parivash finished cooking so you can have some breakfast. You're gonna go help them? Yeah.\r\n                            21:00\r\n                            Ok. Wait. Stay, stay where you are, stay, stay just one minute.\r\n                            21:05\r\n                            Lisa and Susan have to go to work soon. So, just wait. Wait a minute.\r\n                            21:30\r\n                            Lisa: أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ\r\n                            21:50\r\n                            Lisa: بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ Lisa: As Rashad said we're starting with verse 75\r\n                            22:02\r\n                            Lisa: In Sura 56 verse 75\r\n                            22:11\r\n                            Lisa: The honorable Quran [56:75] I swear by the positions of the stars. [56:76] [And it] is an [awesome] oath, if you only knew\r\n                            22:27\r\n                            Lisa: We could talk about that all night. Lisa: We know now, though it was not known 1500... 1400 years ago, how awesome an oath this truly is.\r\n                            22:43\r\n                            1400 years ago, they could see the stars and looking up in the sky being awed by them as we are today. But for us, having the knowledge that we have  \r\n                            22:54\r\n                            we know that what you can see in the night sky is the minutest fraction of the stars there.\r\n                            23:02\r\n                            I'd like to read a little bit of passage, talking  about how big our galaxy and the universe  \r\n                            23:15\r\n                            really is. I don't wanna go too far with  it, but to give us a little bit of a feel  \r\n                            23:21\r\n                            again on how awesome an oath this truly is because it  is a more awesome oath than we could really  \r\n                            23:27\r\n                            comprehend. Even though intellectually we  can try, it's beyond our comprehension.\r\n                            23:37\r\n                            Our sun is only one of perhaps a million stars  within our galaxy, Milky Way. The stars of the  \r\n                            23:44\r\n                            Milky Way is awesome. It would take us a hundred  thousand years at the speed of light to cross it from one end  \r\n                            23:51\r\n                            to the other bearing in mind that the sun's  light travels 93 million miles in 4 minutes.\r\n                            24:06\r\n                            We can appreciate the vastness of the Milky Way, the hundred thousand light years across.\r\n                            24:13\r\n                            From the outer limit of our galaxy how significant the  planet Earth of the solar system is? Our next-door gal... neighbor  \r\n                            24:22\r\n                            galaxy, the closest galaxy to our Milky Way  is 2 million light years away. These are all  \r\n                            24:32\r\n                            established scientific facts that a civilized  and highly educated generation is fortunate to  \r\n                            24:37\r\n                            know. If we go to the center of our neighbor galaxy, can you visualize the planet Earth of the  \r\n                            24:44\r\n                            Milky Way galaxy? How significant is it at that  distance? By moving away from our galaxy to the  \r\n                            24:52\r\n                            nearest galaxy close to us, we are already  talking about incredible distances, millions  \r\n                            24:58\r\n                            of light years. Yet our universe contains a  great number of galaxies. Back in the 1950s\r\n                            25:06\r\n                            (unintelligible) drew the first map of the universe  and its galaxies. One thousand galaxies were surveyed then.\r\n                            25:14\r\n                            And since then, scientists have discovered  1 billion galaxies, more than a million times  \r\n                            25:21\r\n                            what was known 30 years ago. Can you imagine the  vastness of our universe with its billion galaxies  \r\n                            25:30\r\n                            and billion trillion stars? We are now talking  about billions of light years within our universe.\r\n                            25:42\r\n                            Have you lost track of our planet Earth?  How significant is our planet Earth?\r\n                            26:02\r\n                            It is very important to keep this size and  our significance or perspective in order to  \r\n                            26:09\r\n                            appreciate the significance or insignificance  of teeny creatures who inhabited this planet for  \r\n                            26:14\r\n                            brief period of time. And then we have one of the psalms. This is psalm... from psalm 8. \"when I behold your  \r\n                            26:25\r\n                            heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and  stars which you set in place, what is man that You  \r\n                            26:32\r\n                            should be mindful of him or the Son of Man that You  should care for him.\"\r\n                            26:43\r\n                            And yet we get up in the morning and we think (unintelligible). This is truly an awesome oath and God is swearing. [56:75] I swear by the positions of the stars.\r\n                            26:57\r\n                            [56:76] [And it] is an [awesome] oath, if you only knew. [56:77] This is an honorable Quran. [56:78] In a [perfectly preserved] book.\r\n                            27:06\r\n                            [56:79] None can [touch] it except the [righteous]. [56:80] [It is] A revelation from the Lord of the universe.\r\n                            27:14\r\n                            We have in our hand the only thing that we need. God  has blessed us with this incredible blessing.\r\n                            27:23\r\n                            This is our roadmap back to God. And we know that it is, it is an  honorable Quran and it has been perfectly preserved. \r\n                            27:35\r\n                            We, in this mosque, know that better than any people on  earth or we've been incredibly what? incredibly...\r\n                            27:47\r\n                            The miracles continue to come, flooding us, absolutely flooding us, showing with no uncertain... in no uncertain terms that this book is perfectly preserved.\r\n                            28:01\r\n                            And that not only is it perfectly preserved, but it is so incredibly coded that there is no way that  \r\n                            28:08\r\n                            any human being could have even approached the slightest... to the slightest degree approached writing it even more thoroughly.\r\n                            28:17\r\n                            It's beyond, beyond us and truly great. And  we know now also that none can touch it except  \r\n                            28:25\r\n                            the righteous. What does that mean? I mean, that doesn't  mean physically touch it, but it means that no  \r\n                            28:31\r\n                            one can get from this Quran unless they are righteous. Unless they... Unless they're truly thinking of God. And beyond that  \r\n                            28:39\r\n                            and more importantly for us to this point, we know  that no one could discover this miracle, not being righteous.\r\n                            28:46\r\n                            There is no way. This miracle is at off limits of anything we can imagine. God has already sworn by the position of the stars that this is an honorable Quran.\r\n                            28:57\r\n                            This Quran is honorable and it's perfectly preserved and that  is... that... it's overwhelming, massive and overwhelming. So, we know first  \r\n                            29:08\r\n                            of all, we know that this Quran has been preserved. We're also given very clear, very... the strongest of proofs that the discoverer of this code is indeed righteous which is something that obviously all of us realize\r\n                            29:25\r\n                            because (unintelligible)\r\n                            29:33\r\n                            But we know very clearly and that this miracle and the revelation itself has come from God.\r\n                            29:45\r\n                            There is no way, there's no way we could... we could have  made it up or it could have been tricked from God\r\n                            29:53\r\n                            that anyone could even trick God to discover the miracle any more than they could have tricked God to....(unintelligible)\r\n                            30:08\r\n                            Verse 81, [56:81] Are you [then evading] this [message]? [56:82] Do you make it your [share] that you [reject it]?\r\n                            30:16\r\n                            [56:83] [you soul will reach your throat someday] [56:84] [then] you will look around. [56:85] We are closer to it than you are, but you [can] not see. [56:86] [If you do have any power, you should reclaim your soul] [56:87] if you are truthful?\r\n                            30:35\r\n                            Look at how many people are fighting, fighting these verses. These verses, to me, are... are specifically directed  \r\n                            30:43\r\n                            to them as well as obviously to those who reject the Quran.\r\n                            30:49\r\n                            \"Are you... are you evading this message?\" God has already said that the Quran is perfectly preserved that none can touch it except the righteous,\r\n                            30:58\r\n                            and yet there are those who say that they  are Muslim and say that they study the  \r\n                            31:04\r\n                            Quran and yet they reject the miracle and they do it out of ego. They don't like what we do. We're just worshipping God alone, removing all additions, all of the falsehood, all of the garbage and coming back to the very simple truth.\r\n                            31:22\r\n                            It is very simple. It's not easy and until you  make it easy, until you allow it to be easy.\r\n                            31:31\r\n                            It's very simple. And it's very straightforward and clear-cut.\r\n                            31:37\r\n                            Those who are evading  this message and that's truly what it is. I mean,   anyone who reads this, reads this Quran have to, have to evade it or follow it. If you follow it,\r\n                            31:48\r\n                            there's no way you can, can follow Hadith and Sunnah. There's no way you can accept all the other garbage if you're  \r\n                            31:54\r\n                            following the Quran. So, if you're reading it and you're  still following Hadith and Sunnah, you're evading the Quran.\r\n                            32:06\r\n                            [56:82] Do you make it your [share] that you [reject it]? Well, they take the very... it takes a lot of work\r\n                            32:12\r\n                            I think on some level not to accept the truth. You have to... you have to work at rejecting the truth.\r\n                            32:22\r\n                            When you intend to do that or when you do that, then you become a  fanatic person. I think that's a lot of what we've seen.  \r\n                            32:34\r\n                            And it's very clear from the next verses that  none of us can help our lives. None of us can  \r\n                            32:41\r\n                            stop death when it comes. God is closer to  us than our jugular vein. He stands between us  \r\n                            32:50\r\n                            and our hearts. We know that God is in control of every... the minutest detail in the universe. He controls every  \r\n                            33:00\r\n                            atom, every subatomic particle within our body, within the rest of the universe. That power is so  \r\n                            33:11\r\n                            awesome and so incomprehensible to us that it's  probably easier for all people to ignore it because  \r\n                            33:16\r\n                            it's too scary to realize that there is a powerful....\r\n                            33:25\r\n                            And yet we're here to come back to that realization. We're here because we did not remember that when we were in God's Heavenly plain and we're here again, as Laurie so beautifully\r\n                            33:44\r\n                            expressed. We're here again to try and come back within a second chance. Should I... can I stop here? Are there any questions or comments?\r\n                            34:17\r\n                            I'm sorry. Thank you. Excuse me\r\n                            34:23\r\n                            The footnote: the Quran is by no  means a regular book. Only the sincerest seekers of  \r\n                            34:28\r\n                            the truth will be allowed to understand it (see 41:44). The insincere will be prevented from acquiring any  \r\n                            34:35\r\n                            knowledge from the Quran. In fact, those who are prevented by God from learning the Quran. Plainly, this verse means  \r\n                            34:43\r\n                            that no one can physically touch the Quran unless he satisfies certain ablution requirements.\r\n                            34:48\r\n                            Obviously, this distortion is a clear Satanic plot to prevent people from studying God's message to them.\r\n                            34:54\r\n                            Our salvation is in reading, studying, and heeding the Quran.\r\n                            Dr. Rashad Khalifa explains “none can touch it except the righteous”\r\n                            35:02\r\n                            The messenger: It's not really \"touch\", the English word. The Arabic word does not mean \"touch.\" And we have to find another word, but still in English, you can say that.\r\n                            35:15\r\n                            The messenger: It means that nobody can derive anything out of the Quran unless they are sincere.\r\n                            35:23\r\n                            But in Arabic the word is يَمَسُّهُ And it's different from يلمس\r\n                            35:28\r\n                            یلمس is physical touch but يَمَسُّهُ is touch in this meaning that they cannot take, derive, understand anything from letters they see.\r\n                            35:40\r\n                            Cause your teacher is God. When you read this book, you're directly being taught by God as we read in Sura 55. It's not a regular book.\r\n                            35:51\r\n                            This is why you read it over and over a thousand times and you still find new things every time, unlike a novel. You read a novel and that's it.\r\n                            36:00\r\n                            (unintelligible) Cause every time you look in it, God gives you new information.\r\n                            36:09\r\n                            This is.... in verse 77, the Quran in Arabic is described as KARIM. In other places, it is called Quran 'AZIM. And in Sura 50, it is described as Quran MAJEED,\r\n                            36:21\r\n                            Glorious, 'AZIM, Great, KARIM, honorable. So, these are actually a sequence of God's names. I mean, this is awesome to describe the Quran with the same names of God.  \r\n                            36:36\r\n                            'AZIM, MAJEED, KARIM tell you how great this book is. Your salvation is in this book. And we're really... we're really fortunate to be  \r\n                            36:46\r\n                            studying it every week. I mean, the Quran study. Hopefully, you're reading it everyday, at least one verse every day. Make it a duty upon yourself.\r\n                            36:56\r\n                            Cause it... you know, it's a blessing. None can touch it except the righteous. And we have... we have an international\r\n                            37:09\r\n                            observation to prove this in the... the miracle of Quran that is  coming up in this mosque that it is... it is a miracle that\r\n                            37:19\r\n                            is like the Quran, ranges from the very simple  to the very complex. Yet, nobody was allowed to  \r\n                            37:26\r\n                            make any discovery in this miracle except those  who are connected with with us, connected with...\r\n                            37:32\r\n                            to believers, only believers who believe like we do. They believe in worshipping God alone and upholding the word of\r\n                            37:41\r\n                            God alone. Just look at the people made discoveries. I wanna pass this around. Just do it very\r\n                            37:47\r\n                            fast. Just take one and pass on to the next.... This is a summary of the miracle in one page. When you look on the back and there are other  \r\n                            37:57\r\n                            features of the miracle, you'll see that the first verse is 19 letters. The number of Suras is 114, 19 x 6.\r\n                            38:04\r\n                            Is this simple enough? The first verse is 19 letters. The number of Suras is a multiple of 19. Rachel, the first revelation was 19 words.\r\n                            38:14\r\n                            The last revelation 19 words. These are famous first revelations and famous last revelations.\r\n                            38:21\r\n                            And they are very simple. They don't require a computer. But not a  single person outside the fold of believers\r\n                            38:29\r\n                            was allowed to touch it. It's a monopoly. You look at the  people who made major discoveries, Abdullah,\r\n                            38:40\r\n                            Mahmud, Ihsan, Lisa, many others, Feroz, Ismail. These are the people that we know. And they are all... Gatut.... they're\r\n                            38:52\r\n                            all people who firmly believe like we do. And for a long time, I was surprised why doesn't  \r\n                            38:59\r\n                            anybody else find these things, you know? Because  I needed some support. That's very simple.\r\n                            39:06\r\n                            When you look at the back, you see how simple it is. From the missing BISMILLAH to the extra BISMILLAH\r\n                            39:11\r\n                            19 Suras. Is this difficult? I mean, the consistency in repetition of the number 19, it's so simple.\r\n                            39:20\r\n                            Yet, nobody, a billion Muslims in the world but none of  them was allowed to find these very simple facts  \r\n                            39:32\r\n                            unless they upheld the Quran alone. They believed in Hadith and Sunnah and mentioned other names\r\n                            39:40\r\n                            in their prayer. They are not permitted to touch it. This is verse  77. By the way on the wall, you'll see a very  \r\n                            39:51\r\n                            complex miracle, in the circle. This was, it's no  longer the biggest number in the world because this is\r\n                            40:00\r\n                            already obsolete. Abdullah, on his birthday  yesterday, made it obsolete. In this circle,\r\n                            40:09\r\n                            the number begins with the first verse in the Quran, 1. So, if you look on the left, there's an asterisk on the left\r\n                            40:15\r\n                            side of the circle and you see right... you start by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. these are the  \r\n                            40:22\r\n                            verses in the first Sura. 7 verses followed by  the total number of verses in the Sura which is 7.\r\n                            40:29\r\n                            Then, you move on to the next Sura, 1 2 3 4 5 6 all the way to 286,   the number of verses in Sura 2. When you put the total number  of verses in Sura two, 286 and you do this all the way to the  \r\n                            40:40\r\n                            end of the Quran. When you get to the end of the Quran, if you look on the right side, you see this big   arrow that says \"total number of verses in the Quran\", you put that. Now, you have a very long number that is... I like  \r\n                            40:51\r\n                            it in the (unintelligible). It is 1 kilometer long. And it consists of 12,696 digits. And it is a multiple of 19.\r\n                            41:03\r\n                            If you go on, if you see now, if you look on the right  side of the circle in the middle of it with  \r\n                            41:10\r\n                            the big arrow that says \"total number of verses in the Quran.\" After the asterisk comes the total number of\r\n                            41:15\r\n                            verses in the first Sura which is 7. And next to it is the  seven verses 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.\r\n                            41:22\r\n                            Then, you put the total number of verses in Sura  number 2 and so on. So, what we're doing in  \r\n                            41:28\r\n                            the lower half is we are reversing the position of  the total number of verses (unintelligible) at the end of  \r\n                            41:33\r\n                            every Sura. We're putting this in the beginning of every Sura. And brothers and sisters, the number is divisible and go to\r\n                            41:39\r\n                            the end. So, now this is a circle and connect the  two numbers. We have what was until yesterday,\r\n                            41:47\r\n                            the day before yesterday, the longest number in the world, 25388\r\n                            41:52\r\n                            digits. And that's a multiple 19. Now, what  Abdullah did to make this number obsolete,\r\n                            41:59\r\n                            he added the number of ever Sura. Okay, let's go now to the asterisk from the left side in the circle.\r\n                            42:07\r\n                            It begins with the numbers in the first Sura, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\r\n                            42:12\r\n                            followed by the total number of verses in this Sura which is 7. Now, between the two 7s there, he put the\r\n                            42:18\r\n                            number of the Sura, 1. And he did this with every Sura and you get this, the number is still divisible.\r\n                            42:26\r\n                            It's just incredible. And there's more. If you put  the number of the Sura at the beginning or at the\r\n                            42:33\r\n                            end or in the middle, it's still divisible. So, this  would be in the Ramadan issue. In the Muslim Perspective, you're gonna\r\n                            42:43\r\n                            get more, more of the details. So, now I don't know  how many digits there are from the first Sura to the last Sura, the numbers.\r\n                            42:52\r\n                            1 2 3 4, you counted the digits? 114. Sura 1, Sura 2, Sura 3, Sura 4, all the way to Sura 114. How many digits? 472, you add that...\r\n                            43:25\r\n                            OK. This... there's a by-the-way miracle, you know. 1 2 3 4 all the way to the end of the Quran 114, and you put the digits next to each other. 474 digits\r\n                            43:35\r\n                            and it's a multiple of 19. So, you... you put that, you add this to this number which is 25698 digits,\r\n                            43:43\r\n                            you add 474, now you have the biggest number   in the world. It came out of this Quran. 2 4 25 388 plus 1... about. 25800 numbers, digits and that is divisible.\r\n                            44:06\r\n                            In the middle meaning between the last verse and the total number of verses. If you look on   the left side of the circle, you see the asterisk  and above it, you see the number of verses in Sura Al-Fãtehah,\r\n                            44:17\r\n                            number one. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 followed by the total number of verses\r\n                            44:23\r\n                            in the Sura which is another set. So, he put the 1 between the two 7s that you see there. That's the number of the Sura and you do this in all the Suras, it's divisible. If you move the  \r\n                            44:32\r\n                            number of the Sura, put it at the beginning, so you have 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7\r\n                            44:37\r\n                            that's divisible. And if you put the total number  of verses at the beginning, so you have 1 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\r\n                            44:44\r\n                            you still have a divisible number. So, it is.... it sounds like almost a physical impossibility but it locks... it locks  every verse... somebody called today and said\r\n                            44:57\r\n                            \"how do you know it's only the two verses in Sura 9?\" You notice the Sura 9\r\n                            45:03\r\n                            is mentioned here. If you look in the upper right corner of the circle, it says total number of verses in Sura 9.\r\n                            45:08\r\n                            It has to be 127. This fellow was calling from Louisville, Kentucky and he said \"how do you know it's know only  \r\n                            45:14\r\n                            the two verses in Sura 9 that violate  the code?\" So, I thought it was every single verse what we see  \r\n                            45:20\r\n                            here is every single verse in Quran is authenticated as Divine from God, every single one, except these two.\r\n                            45:30\r\n                            So, it's just it is fitting to mention why God swears by the position of the stars  \r\n                            45:38\r\n                            that this is a.... this is a Quran KARIM. By the way, AL-QURAN AL-KARIM has a gematrical value that is 684, a multiple of 19,\r\n                            45:49\r\n                            the numerical value of this... the official name of the Quran, AL-QURAN AL-KARIM.\r\n                            45:56\r\n                            Just to change the subject to make it a little bit lighter. You know how they count the stars? Just some of you do. But any way, they go out\r\n                            46:04\r\n                            in the night and take a picture of the sky, just take a picture and they put in the computer and\r\n                            46:10\r\n                            they count... the computer will count the number of the stars in that area in the picture and there's a formula that tells you what the circumference\r\n                            46:19\r\n                            from the inside of a circle is and then you can... you  can tell from this picture how many are in the  \r\n                            46:26\r\n                            whole circumference of the whole sky and you do  this a hundred times and then you take the average of  \r\n                            46:34\r\n                            a hundred times and you have exactly, almost  exactly, the number of stars, a billion trillion of them.\r\n                            46:41\r\n                            And these are the ones that we see. Because of this... our Sun is in the next galaxy, you will not be able to see it because it is one of the dim stars.\r\n                            46:52\r\n                            What we're seeing are only  the bright stars. This is... this is how we counted them.\r\n                            46:59\r\n                            [56:75] I swear by the positions of the stars. Because they are in perfect positioning, perfect orbits. They don't crash into one another.\r\n                            47:17\r\n                            There was something else also I wanted... the notes are here.\r\n                            47:25\r\n                            Are there any questions?\r\n                            47:52\r\n                            Right, right. We have two halves that are divisible by 19. So, what I'm doing here is just making them into a circle. Well, the upper half is a multiple of 19 and you have the  \r\n                            48:04\r\n                            total number of verses at the end of each Sura. The lower half is a multiple of 19 and connecting them has nothing to do with\r\n                            48:12\r\n                            anything, but in the lower half, you have the number of verses at the beginning   of every Sura. If you look on the right side of  the circle. Look at the right side of the circle at the big  \r\n                            48:22\r\n                            arrow that says \"total number of verses in the Quran.\" We know that you see Sura Al-Fãtehah with the total number of verses which is 7 at\r\n                            48:29\r\n                            the beginning, not at the end. So, you have 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 instead of\r\n                            48:36\r\n                            1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7. Both of  them are independently divisible by 19. And I just  \r\n                            48:42\r\n                            put them next to each other. And this because the  upper half was a discovery by Feroz Karmally.\r\n                            48:54\r\n                            And he put... he ended up... he ended up putting the total number of verses in the Quran at the end of the number.\r\n                            49:02\r\n                            The lower half is Abdullah's discovery and the total number of the verses comes ahead of the Suras. So, the total number of verses in  \r\n                            49:11\r\n                            the Quran fits right there, ahead of the whole Quran. This circle is now obsolete, great but obsolete. We have better circles made. Any other questions? Back to Lisa and verse number? What?\r\n                            49:35\r\n                            Lisa: Verse number 88.\r\n                            49:41\r\n                            [56:88] [Thereafter] If he is one close to Me— [56:89] then [happiness], flowers, and gardens of bliss.\r\n                            49:47\r\n                            [56:90] And if he [belongs with those on] the right— [56:91] [then] peace [to you from] those on the right. [56:92] But if he is one of the [rejectors], the strayers—\r\n                            49:56\r\n                            [56:93] then an abode of [retribution]— [56:94] and burning Hell. [56:95] This is the [inevitable] truth.\r\n                            50:02\r\n                            [56:96] You shall glorify the name of your Lord, the Great.\r\n                            50:10\r\n                            Verse 88 and 89, actually all of these verses, refer back to the beginning\r\n                            50:17\r\n                            verses of this Quran...this Sura where it talks about the High Heaven, the Lower Heaven and Hell. And we see  \r\n                            50:24\r\n                            again in 88 how beautiful the Highest Heaven is.  We know, of course, that these are all allegorical  \r\n                            50:31\r\n                            descriptions. That God uses allegory because  there's no way that we in our present states can  \r\n                            50:38\r\n                            even begin to understand really what is in store  for us. But we know from, from the allegory of the  \r\n                            50:45\r\n                            Highest Heaven that it is truly blessed and that  it is wonderful beyond our dreams. God says that  \r\n                            50:53\r\n                            anything we wish for, anything those who are in the Highest Heaven, IN SHAA ALLAH we'll be there, anything they wish  \r\n                            51:01\r\n                            for and even more. So, God's grace is even greater  than anything we can comprehend or, or desire, wish for.\r\n                            51:14\r\n                            And then those on the right, those in the Lower  Heaven, for them also, it's incredibly beautiful  \r\n                            51:23\r\n                            and it's peace. Peace to you from those on the  right, an incredible incredible triumph to be  \r\n                            51:32\r\n                            among those on the right. But if he is one of  the rejectors strayers, then the retribution  \r\n                            51:40\r\n                            and burning Hell. We know again that we can't  comprehend really the awfulness of Hell.\r\n                            51:53\r\n                            We have a slight idea because we are... it's far from  God as anything in the universe at this point  \r\n                            52:02\r\n                            and we know how hellish this world and how  awful it is particularly when you step out   of God's kingdom. We're incredibly blessed  to be in God's kingdom, IN SHAA ALLAH, but as soon as you  \r\n                            52:13\r\n                            step out, you know how, what an incredible hell  that is and that is nothing compared to the ultimate Hell.\r\n                            52:25\r\n                            [56:95] This is the [inevitable] truth. [56:96] You shall glorify the name of your Lord, the Great.\r\n                            52:33\r\n                            Mã Shã Allãh.\r\n                            \r\n                            \r\n                            22 Quran Study From Behrouz 1222 Sura 39;11 By Rashad Admission Test I Don't Compromise With A Littl\r\n                            \r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem God ALONE\r\n                            0:08\r\n                            Verse 11 says, [39:11] Say, \"I have been commanded to worship GOD, devoting the religion absolutely to Him alone.\r\n                            0:17\r\n                            [39:12] \"And I was commanded to be the utmost submitter.\" [39:13] Say, \"I fear, if I disobeyed my Lord, the retribution of a great day.\"\r\n                            0:31\r\n                            [39:14] Say, \"GOD is the only One I worship, devoting my religion absolutely to Him alone.\r\n                            0:38\r\n                            These are all commandments from God to you.\r\n                            0:46\r\n                            I'm gonna read them again, starting at 11. God is telling you to say, [39:11] ...\"I have been commanded to worship GOD, devoting the religion absolutely to Him alone.\r\n                            0:56\r\n                            So, there is no room for Jesus or Moses or Muhammad or the saints.\r\n                            1:03\r\n                            Huh? Yes. [39:12] \"And I was commanded to be the utmost submitter.\"\r\n                            1:10\r\n                            The utmost submitter never complains. It's a sign of submitter or not.\r\n                            1:18\r\n                            The utmost submitter is content with whatever God gives him and understands.\r\n                            1:25\r\n                            13, [39:13] Say, \"I fear, if I disobeyed my Lord, the retribution of a great day.\"\r\n                            1:32\r\n                            Submitters also realize that everything has a price.\r\n                            1:38\r\n                            And this is now after passing all the tests. And you... You've passed your final test. You're in good shape. And you cannot deviate outside\r\n                            1:48\r\n                            the path that God drew for you. Because if you deviate, it's very expensive.\r\n                            1:56\r\n                            It seems out of proportion, but really it is not.\r\n                            2:01\r\n                            You know, when I got pinched in the past, I'd say \"No! This is too much! I didn't do that bad.\r\n                            2:07\r\n                            And the answer would come back \"yes.\" This is it. You didn't do too bad, but this is the price for it. Yeah.\r\n                            2:15\r\n                            The pinch is always way out of proportion, it seems.\r\n                            2:21\r\n                            I guess because, you know, somehow we grew up with the notion that God is Forgiving, Merciful which is true, but we tend to abuse this.\r\n                            2:30\r\n                            Son.\r\n                            2:37\r\n                            God wants to make you perfect. And the system that I have noticed personally, and maybe you too, is that God will take one of\r\n                            2:46\r\n                            your defects at a time.\r\n                            2:51\r\n                            And He will keep after you until you get rid of that defect. Then, He will start another one, until you cleanse out of that one.\r\n                            3:01\r\n                            The end result is a perfect human being, if there is such a thing.\r\n                            3:06\r\n                            You'll be following God's commandments perfectly. And you'll be a perfect human being.\r\n                            3:16\r\n                            So, the utmost submitter understands all these things.\r\n                            3:24\r\n                            Remember that the utmost submitter has a perfect life.\r\n                            3:30\r\n                            The only reason you have a headache is because of something you have done.\r\n                            3:36\r\n                            I don't think there are any exceptions to that. There are no exceptions. You don't get a scratch or a headache without something you have done.\r\n                            3:44\r\n                            So, it behooves you to find out what it is that you have done.\r\n                            3:50\r\n                            Don't defend yourself either. I used to laugh when I tell some people \"what did you do wrong?\"\r\n                            3:56\r\n                            \"I didn't do anything wrong.\" You know, they become defensive. I say \"hey, wait a minute, you're supposed to join me in attacking your \"self\" and find out what you did wrong.\"\r\n                            4:08\r\n                            They become very defensive. But we're supposed to do this ourselves.\r\n                            4:13\r\n                            We have to find out what did I do wrong. But if I, if I'm too egotistic to pinpoint what I did wrong, then I just go on.\r\n                            4:22\r\n                            Because the punishment will continue until you know what it is. When you know what it is and you repent, it never happens again.\r\n                            4:30\r\n                            The problem is solved. So an utmost submitter means no problems of any kind.\r\n                            4:46\r\n                            It's almost unbelievable. But you see, God taught us repeatedly.\r\n                            4:52\r\n                            God used me as a guinea pig, a happy guinea pig.\r\n                            Dr. Rashad Khalifa talks of a personal experience – demonstrated perfect happiness. Edip doubts perfect happiness. Quran verses proves perfect happiness.\r\n                            5:00\r\n                            I mean, I put myself in situations where a problem should have happened.\r\n                            5:06\r\n                            But it wasn't the cause of God, so a problem didn't happen. And the reason I'm saying this is because Ihsan is sitting here, and she expected a big problem.\r\n                            5:16\r\n                            Thank you. I had... I was busy with this translation, and I slept here three nights in a row. I didn't go home for three days.\r\n                            5:27\r\n                            And then, the answering machine... the telephone rang, the answering machine came on. My wife was on the phone. This is Stephanie. So, Ihsan started to run away.\r\n                            5:35\r\n                            She said \"this is it.\" She's gonna divorce you. You're finished. This is it. A big fight.\r\n                            5:42\r\n                            So, as she was approaching this door here to run away, she heard her say \"I made a batch of Italian cookies, but they were so delicious.\r\n                            5:50\r\n                            I'm sorry we finished all of them. So, I'm gonna make you another batch.\"\r\n                            5:55\r\n                            She couldn't believe it. She, until now, she can't believe it. But this is... God manipulates the minds and the hearts of the people.\r\n                            6:06\r\n                            In fact, this happened again when three or four weeks ago... Huh? A few days ago when this visit.\r\n                            6:13\r\n                            I slept here two nights in a row. And she called.\r\n                            6:18\r\n                            What did she say this time? What did she want?\r\n                            6:26\r\n                            No, say it again. What did... I want to chat. I forget what she wanted, but it was peaceful. She was also running away.\r\n                            6:36\r\n                            Oh, yes, yes, yes. She said \"I'm the happiest person in the world.\" I said \"what?\" Now, now I, I was insulted.\r\n                            6:46\r\n                            \"Ok. Wait a minute.\" Honest, this is what she said. Yes, I remember now. She said \"I'm the happiest person in the world.\"\r\n                            6:51\r\n                            I said \"what's happened?\" She said \"I found the car I've been looking for, for a long time.\"\r\n                            6:56\r\n                            \"I'm like a baby. I'm like a child who found a toy.\" This is exactly what she said.\r\n                            7:02\r\n                            She's been looking for a car.\r\n                            7:09\r\n                            So, I mean, this is a situation that warrants a problem, right, with most people. \"Where have you been?\"\r\n                            7:18\r\n                            \"You're a half hour late.\" \"If you left your office at 2:30, you should have been here at 3 o'clock. It's 4 o'clock now.\"\r\n                            7:30\r\n                            So, what I'm saying is that God's Mercy and Grace allowed us to learn from experience.\r\n                            7:37\r\n                            We really have a track record. And it is... Edip is not comfortable with my statements.\r\n                            7:45\r\n                            Because you have to go through what I went through. When I make a blank statement, blanket statement.\r\n                            7:50\r\n                            \"A believer has a perfect life. No problems, no headaches, no traffic tickets.\" He says, he always says \"What if we grow and we have a lot of people and problems happen?\"\r\n                            7:59\r\n                            They don't happen. God can handle them.\r\n                            8:04\r\n                            God's law is absolute. Let me just read it with you again.\r\n                            8:10\r\n                            Because I wanted to pass this on to the people. Let's look at 10:62 or 11:62. What is it?\r\n                            8:23\r\n                            Page 216.\r\n                            8:29\r\n                            I think Edip will appreciate that because the Arabic is so powerful and he knows it. He knows the Arabic.\r\n                            8:34\r\n                            The top of page 216 says, [10:62] Absolutely, GOD's allies have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve.\r\n                            8:44\r\n                            In Arabic, (10:62) أَلَآ إِنَّ أَوْلِيَآءَ ٱللَّهِ لَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ Very strong Arabic. It says \"Absolutely.\"\r\n                            8:50\r\n                            I tried to bring it in the English as close as possible. [10:62] ...GOD's allies have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve.\r\n                            8:57\r\n                            The next verse identifies who are they. [10:63] They are those who believe and lead a righteous life.\r\n                            9:02\r\n                            That's it. If you believe and lead a righteous life, you have nothing to fear, nor will you grieve.\r\n                            9:16\r\n                            Why are you peeking through the, why are you peeking through the crack? Come on in.\r\n                            9:21\r\n                            A woman: Hi. Is it okay? Dr. Khalifa: Okay, what? A woman: I had to peek over at the museum and I just wanted to come by to pray.\r\n                            9:27\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Sure. That's fantastic.\r\n                            9:37\r\n                            Number 64 says, [10:64] For them, joy in this world,...\r\n                            9:43\r\n                            We don't have to die first before we enjoy Heaven. It happens here. [10:64] For them, joy in this world, and the Hereafter. This is GOD's unchangeable decree. Such is the greatest triumph.\r\n                            Admission tests usually within the first 5yrs can be within the first month. Follower claims she has a cold and fever, Dr. Rashad Khalifa tries to help identify why. Talk of disbelieving family members.\r\n                            10:00\r\n                            So, this is it. God's law.\r\n                            10:05\r\n                            You have to realize that there is an admission test.\r\n                            10:11\r\n                            And the admission test is very exacting, very exacting.\r\n                            10:18\r\n                            It's usually in the first five years after you claim that you've come to worship God alone.\r\n                            10:25\r\n                            It doesn't mean it will last five years. Don't be scared. It comes within the... If you're proven to be a total submitter completely in the first month, then it is over.\r\n                            10:36\r\n                            But you must realize it happens. And all the while, you're in God's hands. The test is very tough.\r\n                            10:43\r\n                            Where is Mahmoud?\r\n                            10:48\r\n                            Did he leave? Yes, so, he's going to take his car. Mahmoud is undergoing a test like this.\r\n                            10:55\r\n                            He temporarily lost his wife, his kids, his cars, his computers. And he's very cheerful as you see. But it's all temporary.\r\n                            11:06\r\n                            Everything will be restored and twice as much. He knows that.\r\n                            11:12\r\n                            He's a good believer. And we know that. But what I wanna say is that when you have a problem, you understand, you must understand the root of the problem. What is it?\r\n                            11:22\r\n                            Why am I having this problem? So, if you're not in the admission test, then you did something wrong.\r\n                            11:29\r\n                            In the admission test, simply, you say that you're gonna worship God alone, and Satan says otherwise.\r\n                            11:36\r\n                            You know, \"Behrouz doesn't mean it. He's just saying that.\" And God tells him \"OK, you can go and beat him up, but within a limit. You cannot do this and this to him.\"\r\n                            11:47\r\n                            So, Satan starts on Behrouz, beats him up, gives him backache, a few other problems.\r\n                            11:54\r\n                            But it doesn't fear Behrouz. He continues to worship God alone. Then, he's proven to be worshiping God alone. Then, all the blessings open up.\r\n                            12:03\r\n                            Just, just watch. Pardon?\r\n                            12:08\r\n                            A woman: I also have a cold and fever, you know, I must be (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: You have cold and fever now? A woman: Yes, (unintelligible)\r\n                            12:14\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Oh, well, this is part of the fun of traveling, you know.\r\n                            12:30\r\n                            The only thing wrong that I can think of that you did may be feeling sympathy for the people who, out of ignorance, were idolizing Muhammad and Ibrahim and so on which is...\r\n                            12:40\r\n                            A woman: I do feel that they were idolizing (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Yes. A woman: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            12:48\r\n                            A woman: (unintelligible)\r\n                            12:53\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Well, their judgment is in God's hand. But I don't think...\r\n                            12:59\r\n                            I think your cold and fever will go away as soon as you're convinced that that was wrong.\r\n                            13:07\r\n                            You do that. Just a little principle, a reminder from God to us to make everything right.\r\n                            13:17\r\n                            But this is a common... By the way, this is a common thing that I went through and everybody goes through\r\n                            13:23\r\n                            that we feel for our grandparents and so on. They were, they were all nice people. We loved them very much.\r\n                            13:29\r\n                            And our wishful thinking tells us \"maybe, they didn't know or their intention were good\" and so on.\r\n                            13:35\r\n                            A woman: But we have come to know because you have come in our time. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. A woman: (unintelligible) and perhaps. they would have believed. Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, but...\r\n                            13:41\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, but see they had the Quran. They had the message there. Dr. Khalifa: Ok, Lisa, you better get going. Yeah.\r\n                            13:46\r\n                            A woman: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            13:52\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yes, but you see, if they deserved better, God would have seen to it that they received the corrections.\r\n                            14:01\r\n                            A woman: Because exactly this line my father would say, like \"if there's a true believer, nothing A woman: can harm him and God will give him Heaven in this world.\" Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            14:08\r\n                            A woman: And he will enjoy life. There can't be a happier person. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. A woman: And he was one (unintelligible) wherever he went. Dr. Khalifa: Mã Shã Allãh.\r\n                            14:18\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: This, yeah... Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, but this is fine, but you cannot generalize it to the population.\r\n                            14:25\r\n                            If you know a person personally and you see very well that he is worthy of Heaven, he probably did go to Heaven.\r\n                            14:31\r\n                            Probably God understood his situation. I'm sure, not probably, I'm sure God understood his situation. But we cannot generalize this and we cannot sympathize with that\r\n                            14:40\r\n                            for our own good because if I say \"maybe, these people had good intentions\" and we defend them, Satan will capitalize on that.\r\n                            14:50\r\n                            He says \"see, he or she is defending the idol worshippers.\"\r\n                            14:57\r\n                            A woman: I got a terrible headache yesterday because I was questioning this (unintelligible) about the... Dr. Khalifa: Yes, the case of the first cousin. I'm glad, I'm glad you knew that, yeah.\r\n                            15:07\r\n                            This is a good example, actually. And 99.9%, this is exactly the connection.\r\n                            15:15\r\n                            A woman: (unintelligible.) Then, I started to understand. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: And it's wonderful to know that, because you probably never again question the wisdom of the Quran.\r\n                            15:24\r\n                            A woman: I didn't mean to, but the way I sounded, I probably... Dr. Khalifa: Yes, exactly. It is the way it sounds.\r\n                            15:30\r\n                            You see, Mrs. Amirali was perfectly innocent when she was talking about those past generations. But Satan will take that innocent statement and then make a big mountain out of it.\r\n                            15:39\r\n                            He will actually say \"she is defending the idol worshippers.\" And there is a law in the Quran that you do not defend idol worshippers, even if they were your parents, your... and so on.\r\n                            15:52\r\n                            Remember, he's a liar. Satan is a liar. And if we don't word our statements carefully, especially when we're touching on the issue of idol worship,\r\n                            Satan capitalizes on our wrong utterances. Do not compromise with a “little insurance”. Follower talks of backache.\r\n                            16:03\r\n                            he will take that and will capitalize. If I say the slightest thing in defense, away from God. So, this is why I don't compromise when they ask me about\r\n                            16:12\r\n                            white lies and little insurance and things. I don't compromise because if I say anything\r\n                            16:18\r\n                            that is a little, just slightly away from God's law, Satan will capitalize on it. And say \"see, he doesn't follow your law.\"\r\n                            16:26\r\n                            Then, I'll get smashed on the head. Because God invariably calls Satan's excuses.\r\n                            16:35\r\n                            And He says \"okay, go test him.\" Because God puts limits on him.\r\n                            16:41\r\n                            When He sends him to test you, He puts limits on you. He says \"you can give her a cold and fever, but that's about it. You cannot give her a headache,\" for example.\r\n                            16:56\r\n                            We need to understand this mechanism. We believe in God. God told us \"there is Satan.\" And we need to understand what does Satan do.\r\n                            17:04\r\n                            We read the other day, some of you were here, some were not, that Satan will come from your right, your left, from your right, right, left, front and back.\r\n                            17:13\r\n                            He will come to you from every direction. And he will exactly catch those sentences that may be misunderstood to mean that you're defending the idol worshippers or deviating from God's law.\r\n                            17:27\r\n                            And he'll say \"this person... .\" He will lie.\r\n                            17:33\r\n                            But he will use your words. So, we don't wanna give him a chance to do that.\r\n                            17:39\r\n                            Like Roxana said, she didn't mean to question God's wisdom. She was just discussing the thing intellectually.\r\n                            17:44\r\n                            But it sounded like, if I didn't know her, I would think she was questioning God's wisdom. \"Why didn't God prohibit first cousins?\"\r\n                            17:51\r\n                            \"Why are the Christians wiser than God, for example, in prohibiting first cousins marriages?\"\r\n                            17:57\r\n                            Satan will do that. Satan will say \"Roxana means that You're not wise, as wise as the Christians.\"\r\n                            18:07\r\n                            Roxana: I think it takes a while before we realize that every letter of the Quran has to be followed, otherwise we makes mistakes. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            18:14\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yes, exactly. It takes a while. It takes a while.\r\n                            18:20\r\n                            Where is Martha? Martha.\r\n                            18:26\r\n                            No jumping, honey. Sit down. Sit down. Don't jump.\r\n                            18:32\r\n                            Shut the door. Oh, are you there? Oh, you're praying?\r\n                            18:39\r\n                            Okay. I just wanna keep the kids under control, because they're jumping now. A woman: Nora, thank you.\r\n                            19:00\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Mrs. Amir-Ali is not supposed to have a headache or cold or flu or anything like that.\r\n                            19:15\r\n                            I think also we have to realize the limitations of our bodies, I guess.\r\n                            19:21\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, I don't wanna compromise with that. A woman: No, no. Behrouz: Well, my problem is...\r\n                            19:26\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: I just remembered... Behrouz: My back problem is (unintelligible). I knew that I was not supposed to pick up anything. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            19:34\r\n                            Behrouz: But surprisingly, in four days, I didn't have any pain.\r\n                            19:40\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: It's just part of the test. You took Mehdi's... Behrouz: Yes. At this time... Dr. Khalifa: You love him so much that you said \"I'm gonna take you backache. Behrouz: Yes.\r\n                            19:48\r\n                            Behrouz: I don't know if he's gonna love me this much. Dr. Khalifa: Because it's his anniversary.\r\n                            19:54\r\n                            God will love you and will remove it. God loves you and will remove it, IN SHAA ALLAH.\r\n                            “If you give God the credit you can brag” about God’s blessings. Satan and the Angels do not know what’s in your mind. Only God knows what’s in your innermost thoughts. Your “companion” plants bad thoughts.\r\n                            20:02\r\n                            The reason I said... I stopped in the middle of the sentence, we have to realize the limitations of our bodies.\r\n                            20:07\r\n                            I'm gonna say Alhamdu Lillah, Mã Shã Allãh, Subhan Allah, and all these, because you can brag when you say that.\r\n                            20:13\r\n                            You give God the credit, you can brag about it. Brother Abdul Hayy was here, and he came and looked at my computer, my chair.\r\n                            20:21\r\n                            And he said \"you're supposed to have a terrible backache.\" Because I'm sitting at the computer, on average, ten hours a day.\r\n                            20:28\r\n                            He said \"this computer is too high or too low. The chair is this and that.\" He said \"do you have back problems?\" I said \"no.\"\r\n                            20:35\r\n                            He said \"you're supposed to.\" But, so, this is what I mean by even the body limitations.\r\n                            20:42\r\n                            God will heal you somehow. You're in your admission test, so don't complain.\r\n                            20:50\r\n                            You're not complaining. Alhamdu Lillah. A woman: Ok. Satan (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Right.\r\n                            21:01\r\n                            A woman: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Mã Shã Allãh. A woman: (unintelligible) Does he know what is in your mind? But sometimes... Dr. Khalifa: No.\r\n                            21:10\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, he doesn't know what's in your mind. A woman: (unintelligible) what you say orally? Dr. Khalifa: Right.\r\n                            21:15\r\n                            Satan and even the Angels do not know what's in your mind. But, but, there's a big but.\r\n                            21:23\r\n                            God knows what's in your mind. You see, this is at the end of Sura 2. God is the only one who knows what's in your innermost thoughts.\r\n                            21:32\r\n                            Not only He knows what's in your mind, He knows what's in your mind ten years from now. That's in Sura 20.\r\n                            21:39\r\n                            God knows, He knows what is more secret than the secret. So, what's more secret than the secret?\r\n                            21:45\r\n                            The future secret. So, So, Satan doesn't know what's in your mind, but God does.\r\n                            21:53\r\n                            So, and God says \"do not have anything wrong inside, inside your mind.\"\r\n                            21:59\r\n                            Go ahead. A man: So, even thoughts that come into your mind, Satan doesn't put them there.\r\n                            22:09\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Your companion does. Yes. Your companion is in there. And your companion puts those thoughts, and it is your job to sift through them.\r\n                            22:18\r\n                            And if it's... In fact, remember the verse that says \"the believers, when a whisper from the devil comes to them, they seek refuge in God.\"\r\n                            22:29\r\n                            Your companion is your devil. And it's your job to counter those bad thoughts.\r\n                            22:39\r\n                            He will ask you to do all kinds of bad things, to lie, cheat, lose your temper.\r\n                            22:45\r\n                            A child: Ok. Ok. Dr. Khalifa: Does this mean Batul lose her temper? No. No way.\r\n                            22:53\r\n                            Then, look at her like that.\r\n                            23:01\r\n                            \"Are you telling me that Princess Batul loses her temper? No.\" With two kids like that.\r\n                            23:11\r\n                            A man: So, your companion is not in touch with Satan? Dr. Khalifa: No. Dr. Khalifa: He is Satan. He represents Satan.\r\n                            23:20\r\n                            He already has his built-in natural instinct to tell you not to Pray, not to worship God alone, not to be honest, etc., etc.\r\n                            23:28\r\n                            It's already, that's his nature. A man: So, Satan has no... is not in touch with them until...\r\n                            23:35\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: That's his seed. That's his seed. And it's inside your brain. So, this is the, this is the only access he has to your brain.\r\n                            23:45\r\n                            But it's your job and my job to convert this seed of Satan into a God-worshipping jinn.\r\n                            23:53\r\n                            A woman: So, it's about your practices in (unintelligible) and living the righteous life that converts Satan? Dr. Khalifa: See, he's reading the Quran now, as you are reading. She is reading the Quran now, excuse me.\r\n                            People who use Jinns.\r\n                            24:02\r\n                            Yeah, as you read the Quran, she too is reading the Quran. And she's thinking about it. Edip: You convinced her and him. Now you are beginning to hear it. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Exactly.\r\n                            24:13\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: She tried her best to keep you from doing this. But you won, and you brought her.\r\n                            24:22\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: In Sura 72, verse 6, that human beings sometimes use the jinn and they end up in trouble.\r\n                            24:30\r\n                            And I know some people who used the jinns, and the jinns became their gods.\r\n                            24:38\r\n                            And on the Day of Judgment, God will ask some of those jinns about that, and they will disown each other.\r\n                            24:50\r\n                            I know one person who called the jinn jinn, and the jinn said \"I am Ali Ibn Abi Taaleb.\"\r\n                            24:57\r\n                            And they will ask about these things, you know, and the jinn will play around with them, will give them information that they actually believe,\r\n                            25:09\r\n                            And that caused their destruction. A man: That information (unintelligible) wrong.\r\n                            25:16\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Of course, it's wrong. A man: They are the big jinn of Ali, for example?\r\n                            25:23\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, probably not the jinn of Ali, but the companion of Ali. Because Ali died too long ago.\r\n                            25:29\r\n                            I haven't heard of a jinn that's 1400 years old.\r\n                            25:35\r\n                            If the jinns want to play around, they can say anything they want, whatever they say. If the person is crazy about Elvis Presley, they will come and say \"I'm Elvis.\"\r\n                            25:44\r\n                            They'll even sing. Just to fool the humans.\r\n                            25:53\r\n                            See what can keep the kids quiet? What can you do to keep them quiet?\r\n                            26:06\r\n                            No, I have a better idea of separating them. Everybody call your kid next to you.\r\n                            26:13\r\n                            Let them sit next to you.\r\n                            26:21\r\n                            They can hear something useful sometimes. Oh yeah, I've got my kid here.\r\n                            26:46\r\n                            Okay, Mã Shã Allãh, it's nice and quiet this way.\r\n                            26:54\r\n                            Yes. 159 says, [37:159] GOD be glorified; far above their claims. [37:160] Only GOD's servants who are devoted to Him alone (will be saved).\r\n                            Invoke angels by saying Mashallah.\r\n                            27:05\r\n                            [37:161] Indeed, you and what you worship. [37:162] Cannot impose anything on Him. [37:163] Everyone of you will burn in Hell.\r\n                            27:13\r\n                            All those people who blaspheme against God and are misled by the jinns, etc. etc.\r\n                            27:21\r\n                            Those who are not devoted to God alone have chosen, insisted on going to Hell.\r\n                            27:28\r\n                            The Angels [37:164] Each one of us has a specific job.\r\n                            27:36\r\n                            So, when you look at your kid and you say \"Mã Shã Allãh.\" There's an angel specializing in protecting that kid.\r\n                            27:44\r\n                            \"Mã Shã Allãh\" invokes that protection. There's a mechanism for everything.\r\n                            27:55\r\n                            When you get up in the morning and you say \"Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem. La Elaha Ella Allah,\" this invokes an angel to stay with you all day and see to it that you have a nice day.\r\n                            28:09\r\n                            165, the angels say, [37:165] We are the arrangers. Organizers.\r\n                            28:14\r\n                            [37:166] We have duly glorified (our Lord). [37:167] They used to say, [37:168] \"Had we received the correct instructions from our parents, [37:169] \"we would have been worshipers; devoted to GOD alone.\"\r\n                            28:29\r\n                            [37:170] But they disbelieved, and they will find out. Victory for the Messengers Guaranteed\r\n                            28:35\r\n                            [37:171] Our decision is already decreed for our servants the messengers. [37:172] They are surely the victors. [37:173] Our soldiers are the winners.\r\n                            28:49\r\n                            [37:174] So disregard them for awhile. [37:175] Watch them; they too will watch. [37:176] Do they challenge our retribution? [37:177] When it hits, they will be sorry; they have been warned.\r\n                            29:01\r\n                            [37:178] Disregard them for awhile. [37:179] Watch them; they too will watch. [37:180] Glory be to your Lord, the great Lord; far above their claims.\r\n                            29:10\r\n                            [37:181] Peace be upon the messengers. [37:182] Praise be to GOD, Lord of the universe.\r\n                            29:17\r\n                            You notice the Quran is teaching us to make no distinction among the messengers.\r\n                            29:22\r\n                            So, God says [37:181] Peace be upon the messengers.\r\n                            29:28\r\n                            The next Sura In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful [38:1] S. (Saad),* and the Quran that contains the mathematical code.**\r\n                            29:37\r\n                            The message, or the miracle. And the Praying that we went through this today. We looked at the references, and where this word was used.\r\n                            29:52\r\n                            And it seems to point, among the other things, to the mathematical code of the Quran.\r\n                            29:58\r\n                            [38:2] Those who disbelieve have plunged into arrogance and defiance.\r\n                            30:04\r\n                            [38:3] Many a generation before them we annihilated. They called for help, but to no avail.\r\n                            30:10\r\n                            [38:4] They wondered that a warner should come to them, from among them. The disbelievers said, \"he is a magician; a liar.\r\n                            30:18\r\n                            [38:5] \"Did he make the gods into one god? \"Oh, no. How strange.\"\r\n                            30:24\r\n                            [38:5] ...This is really strange.\" Because every messenger came with the message \"there is no god except the one God.\"\r\n                            30:30\r\n                            \"You must forget about the saints, the prophets, the messengers, as idols.\"\r\n                            30:39\r\n                            [38:5] \"Did he make the gods into one god? This is really strange.\" [38:6] The leaders announced, \"Go and steadfastly persevere in worshiping your gods. This is all you need.\r\n                            30:51\r\n                            [38:7] \"We never heard of this from the religion of our fathers. This is a lie. These are the things that we hear exactly.\r\n                            Cannot follow the parents blindly. “Heaven and Hell start here”. Talk of a suicidal billionaire who committed suicide and went to heaven.\r\n                            31:01\r\n                            [38:7] \"We never heard of this from the religion of our fathers...\r\n                            31:06\r\n                            This is their problem. And repeatedly, the Quran says \"when they are told \"follow God's revelations.\" They say \"no, we follow what our parents taught us.\"\r\n                            31:15\r\n                            So, one needs to have an open mind and a free freedom.\r\n                            31:21\r\n                            You can't follow the parents blindly. There's too much at stake.\r\n                            31:28\r\n                            And this means perfect happiness here in this world. There's terrible misery here in this world. Heaven and Hell begin right here.\r\n                            31:36\r\n                            And all we need to do is step into God's kingdom. Then, we are guaranteed perfect happiness.\r\n                            31:43\r\n                            You step into Satan's kingdom and you're guaranteed perfect misery. Even if you make millions and live in mansions and...\r\n                            31:53\r\n                            What did Christina Onassis do with all her billions? She tried to commit suicide six times.\r\n                            32:01\r\n                            Finally, she succeeded and went to Heaven because she was really in... she was... her circumstances.\r\n                            32:10\r\n                            She was... what is it, abused, oppressed, misguided, mistreated, whatever.\r\n                            32:17\r\n                            God knows her circumstances. She died at the age of 38.\r\n                            32:22\r\n                            But she was a very unhappy person.\r\n                            32:30\r\n                            How about her father, one of the richest men in the world? And all, all God did was nullify the muscles in his eyelids.\r\n                            32:39\r\n                            I mean, these are the weakest muscles in our body. He couldn't, he couldn't open his eyes.\r\n                            32:46\r\n                            He was willing to pay a hundred million dollars to fix that. He couldn't.\r\n                            32:52\r\n                            He had the scotch tape. He had to keep it completely open all the time.\r\n                            32:58\r\n                            And this is suffering, you know, because it burns. Imagine keeping your eyes open all the time. Just try it for two minutes, see what happens.\r\n                            33:06\r\n                            You cannot do it. It's the simple design that we take for granted.\r\n                            33:11\r\n                            But God designed it to clean our eyes, wipe our eyes, and scratch our eyes.\r\n                            33:19\r\n                            Yes. But it also moistens our eyes. There's a continuous flow of liquid in there.\r\n                            33:35\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Are we going with you? A man: No. Dr. Khalifa: Alright.\r\n                            33:40\r\n                            Yeah, go ahead. The question.\r\n                            33:45\r\n                            Come, it's your problem. Thank you, Edip.\r\n                            34:16\r\n                            173 says, [37:173] Our soldiers are the winners. by the way. [37:173] Our soldiers are the winners.\r\n                            34:22\r\n                            The believers are guaranteed victory, guaranteed. You know, every page of the Quran tells us that God is controlling everything.\r\n                            34:31\r\n                            It just takes a believer to take advantage of that and enjoy it.\r\n                            34:44\r\n                            There's a distinction going on between God's kingdom and Satan's kingdom. God's kingdom is characterized by perfect happiness, perfect health, perfect wealth, perfect peace of mind.\r\n                            34:57\r\n                            Satan's kingdom is characterized by misery no matter what. It is proven over and over again that money, power, all the things that people work hard for do not guarantee happiness.\r\n                            “All happiness is in God’s hand”.\r\n                            35:13\r\n                            All these people who have attained everything, money, mansion, power, fame, good looks, they come...\r\n                            35:22\r\n                            The front page is telling us they're unhappy. So, I think this principle is very well established, that money, power, fame, good looks do not guarantee happiness at all.\r\n                            35:41\r\n                            There's a statement in Quran says that all happiness is in God's hand, all dignity, happiness is in God's hand, all of it.\r\n                            35:53\r\n                            And the same expression, (10:65) ٱلْعِزَّةَ لِلَّهِ جَمِيعًا Does this mean anything in Farsi?\r\n                            35:58\r\n                            (10:65) ٱلْعِزَّةَ لِلَّهِ جَمِيعًا All Izzat (power) belongs in God's hand.\r\n                            36:05\r\n                            And God decreed, made a law that He will give it only to the believers.\r\n                            36:18\r\n                            God controls everything with all the gifts. \"The more you thank Me, the more I give you.\" God says.\r\n                            36:25\r\n                            So, what does this mean? The more we are appreciative, the more God will give us.\r\n                            36:32\r\n                            If we turn unappreciative, we lose everything.\r\n                            36:37\r\n                            Just make a point of thanking God every chance you get for everything you have.\r\n                            36:44\r\n                            Excuse me. Then, God will give you more.\r\n                            36:53\r\n                            A woman: (unintelligible) appreciate what God has given us. A woman: And we praise that, but in the meanwhile we say that \"thank you Lord, this is from You.\"\r\n                            37:03\r\n                            A woman: (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: Sure. Dr. Khalifa: This is how we thank God for whatever He gave you.\r\n                            37:10\r\n                            Thank God for your health, for getting your children.\r\n                            37:20\r\n                            How much would you pay to have (unintelligible) next to you?\r\n                            37:26\r\n                            A million dollars, right? I knew of times when you were willing to pay a million dollars for this.\r\n                            37:33\r\n                            All it took was Surah Al-Hamd.\r\n                            37:41\r\n                            Yes. Yes.\r\n                            37:48\r\n                            God never turned us down.\r\n                            37:55\r\n                            How is your back, Mehdi? (unintelligible)\r\n                            38:02\r\n                            Behrouz has been carrying furnaces for the last week.\r\n                            38:07\r\n                            He did it in Stockton and again in Tucson. So at the end of this session, IN SHAA ALLAH, we read Al-Fãtehah for him and tomorrow he wakes up as good as new, IN SHAA ALLAH.\r\n                            38:20\r\n                            Yes. Just take the back pain and throw it away from here.\r\n                            38:26\r\n                            IN SHAA ALLAH Oh no worries, they're not disbelievers.\r\n                            38:34\r\n                            Plenty of them, don't worry. Number nine says,\r\n                            38:40\r\n                            [38:9] Do they own the treasures of your Lord's mercy. He is the Almighty, the Grantor. But number eight, we didn't read yet.\r\n                            38:47\r\n                            Because they question God's wisdom about choosing His messengers.\r\n                            38:52\r\n                            Number eight, [38:8] \"Why did the message come down to him, instead of us?\" Indeed, they are doubtful of My message. Indeed, they have not yet tasted My retribution.\r\n                            39:02\r\n                            [38:9] Do they own the treasures of your Lord's mercy. He is the Almighty, the Grantor.\r\n                            39:10\r\n                            [38:10] Do they possess the kingship of the heavens and the earth, and everything between them? Let them promote themselves.\r\n                            39:19\r\n                            [38:11] Instead, whatever forces they can muster—even if all their parties banded together—will be defeated.\r\n                            39:27\r\n                            Look what's happening to communism. God gave them 40 years of communism to clean out the trinity and then He let them do it.\r\n                            39:41\r\n                            Perfect plan. Open up.\r\n                            39:48\r\n                            Wake up, brother. Okay, I believe you.\r\n                            40:00\r\n                            How many years have the East Europe seen communism?\r\n                            40:06\r\n                            Since 1935? A man: Since 44, yeah. Dr. Khalifa: 44, yeah.\r\n                            40:20\r\n                            So, beginning now, the Soviet Union should break up. Did you hear? A man: Yeah, but the ideology does not break up. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            40:28\r\n                            A man: It's just that they are fed up with the old guys. They want to do away with the old guys. Dr. Khalifa: And communism. Did you see the Romanian flag?\r\n                            40:36\r\n                            A man: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: Yeah? What does it look like now? A man: (unintelligible)\r\n                            40:41\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: He was an opponent of Ceaușescu. Well, not for long. The communism is out.\r\n                            40:50\r\n                            Did you say communism succeeded? A man: They are still in power.\r\n                            40:55\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Okay. A man: For for human... With human standards. For all political persons, they are still in power. They still control\r\n                            41:04\r\n                            the secret services. They still control the army. They still control the media. And they control...\r\n                            41:10\r\n                            Because the people in the streets are socialists. They want socialism to work.\r\n                            41:19\r\n                            They are disbelievers. Dr. Khalifa: I see. A man: And they want socialism to work. Dr. Khalifa: So, we have to conclude that communism is a success, basically.\r\n                            41:27\r\n                            A man: The people are still supporting socialism. The people (unintelligible).\r\n                            41:33\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: I'm agreeing with you. Number 11.\r\n                            41:39\r\n                            [38:11] Instead, whatever forces they can muster....will be defeated. Number 12. [38:12] Disbelieving before them were the people of Noah, 'Ãd, and the mighty Pharaoh.\r\n                            41:48\r\n                            [38:13] Also, Thamoud, the people of Lot, the dwellers of the Woods (of Midyan); those were the parties.\r\n                            41:54\r\n                            [38:14] Each of them disbelieved the messengers and thus, My retribution was inevitable. [38:15] These people can expect a single blow, from which they will never recover.\r\n                            42:06\r\n                            They challenged... These people I understand to be the Arabs. And one blow I understand to be an asteroid from space.\r\n                            42:14\r\n                            IN SHAA ALLAH. Number 16. [38:16] They challenged: \"Our Lord, why do you not rush the retribution for us, before the Day of Reckoning.\"\r\n                            42:24\r\n                            They challenged God.\r\n                            42:30\r\n                            This is it. We really read two pages and we leave the floor open for questions and discussion.\r\n                            42:38\r\n                            A man: Why is this the people of the Woods? Dr. Khalifa: Midyan. Midyan.\r\n                            42:46\r\n                            This is another name for Midyan. Which is now Gaza, Gaza Strip.\r\n                            42:52\r\n                            That's what Midyan is. A man: In the translation in this (unintelligible).\r\n                            43:00\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: So? People of the Woods. A man: (unintelligible) Woods.\r\n                            43:05\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: What is KHASHAB? Do you have KHASHAB in Farsi? A woman: KHASHAB? Dr. Khalifa: KHASHAB?\r\n                            43:10\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Wood, what is wood? A woman: KHASHAB? A man: CHOOB (چوب) A child: KHASHAB\r\n                            43:16\r\n                            A child KHESHAB (gun's magazine) Dr. Khalifa: He knows. A woman: He can't take it enough.\r\n                            43:24\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Ok, folks. There's a new word in the Farsi language. The new generation knows.\r\n                            43:30\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: CHOOB (چوب)? A man: CHOOB (چوب) Dr. Khalifa: CHOOB (چوب). So, it will be the people of the CHOOB. A man: The people of the CHOOB. Ok.\r\n                            43:37\r\n                            A man: But the Woods here means JANGAL (jungle).\r\n                            43:42\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Not necessarily, no.\r\n                            43:49\r\n                            A man: Carpenter. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: They would have been carpenting\r\n                            43:54\r\n                            A man: NAJJAR. Do you mean carpenter? Dr. Khalifa: NAJJAR Dr. Khalifa: Don't call NAJJAR. Whatever the Arabic says.\r\n                            44:01\r\n                            The people of the Woods. (38:13) أَصْحَـٰبُ لْـَٔيْكَةِ A man: لْـَٔيْكَةِ Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            44:20\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: We don't have to put around interpretation. Go ahead. A man: It's funny when you say \"they get tricked by big literaries.\"\r\n                            44:30\r\n                            When I was in Tunisia, I was young, I was envious of the Saudis.\r\n                            44:35\r\n                            So, \"they, they are the people who are very closer to God.\"\r\n                            44:41\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: They are the (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Yes. A man: Yes. A man: Because when they are trying to give us (unintelligible), you don't have to do Ramadan.\r\n                            44:53\r\n                            A man: So (unintelligible), they are the people (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            “Jews are God’s chosen people” but were still persecuted, the Arabs deserted the Quran they too will suffer retribution.\r\n                            45:00\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: You see, having this message creates a great responsibility.\r\n                            45:06\r\n                            It's a great privilege and a great responsibility. Because God says that the Jews, for example, are His chosen people.\r\n                            45:15\r\n                            This is in the Quran a few times. So, why are they suffering so much? Why did Hitler kill so many of them?\r\n                            45:23\r\n                            Why were they scattered all over the world? Persecuted and discriminated against.\r\n                            45:29\r\n                            Because of the responsibility. They received the scripture and they didn't follow it. Now, the Arabs received the Quran, which is a lot more powerful.\r\n                            45:39\r\n                            It is the complete message. Every page says \"God alone\" and they abandoned it. And this is documented in the Quran, in Sura 25.\r\n                            45:48\r\n                            That they deserted the Quran. So, you can imagine that their retribution will be a lot worse.\r\n                            45:55\r\n                            And it's inevitable.\r\n                            46:06\r\n                            A man: God says in the Quran that He never destroys a land before bringing a messenger.\r\n                            46:16\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: The bad signs. A man: When the messenger comes, (unintelligible) does that land get destroyed? Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            46:21\r\n                            A man: Yes? Dr. Khalifa: Yes, I can say that 100%. It's in Sura 17, God says \"I will not send a retribution before I send a messenger.\r\n                            46:30\r\n                            I mean, God made it conditional. So, all these miracles that are showing up, and the message, and the messenger, mean that there is severe repudiation coming\r\n                            46:42\r\n                            to the disbelievers. A man: So, land means, what? (unintelligible)\r\n                            46:48\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, there is no land. A man: They are a native nations.\r\n                            46:53\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, God left it blank. He says \"we do not...we do not...\"\r\n                            47:02\r\n                            Let's look at Sura 17.\r\n                            47:08\r\n                            You can see the expression.\r\n                            47:33\r\n                            I'm trying to find a different quote.\r\n                            48:00\r\n                            A woman: 15. Dr. Khalifa: 15?\r\n                            48:12\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, the end of 15.\r\n                            48:20\r\n                            It says, [17:15] ....We never punish without first sending a messenger.\r\n                            48:28\r\n                            Cause the messenger points out, gives a choice to the people and then they have to make a decision.\r\n                            48:33\r\n                            After making the decision, they are held responsible for it.\r\n                            48:49\r\n                            Yes, this life, yes. It's talking about this world. yeah.\r\n                            49:00\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: What's the verse number? A man: It's 24.\r\n                            49:07\r\n                            (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Why don't you read it?\r\n                            49:13\r\n                            Go ahead read aloud so everybody can hear you. A man: 24\r\n                            49:21\r\n                            (unintelligible) page here 454.\r\n                            49:26\r\n                            A man: And (unintelligible) 24\r\n                            49:35\r\n                            (unintelligible)\r\n                            49:40\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: This is an incident where David was in a sanctuary and these two people went in, snuck in.\r\n                            49:50\r\n                            with 99 sheep. Yeah.\r\n                            49:55\r\n                            They were fighting over one sheep. Well, actually, there's a great lesson here, but I wonder why did you take this out.\r\n                            Explanation of the story of David and 99 sheep. Be careful with our judgements.\r\n                            50:04\r\n                            A man: I did it before, actually. 24. Dr. Khalifa: You don't know what it is? A man: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: It's just two brothers, two brothers.\r\n                            50:13\r\n                            One had 99 sheep and the other had one sheep. God wants to teach us a lesson about being very careful when you judge between the people.\r\n                            50:23\r\n                            And this... the fellows, they went to David to judge between them.\r\n                            50:29\r\n                            The fellow with the one sheep said \"I have one sheep and he has 99 sheep and he wants to take mine. And he insists on it.\"\r\n                            50:38\r\n                            So obviously, the one with the 99 sheep... David said \"no, keep your sheep. Don't give it to the fellow. He has with 99 of them. You have only one.\"\r\n                            50:47\r\n                            \"So, if you give him your sheep, you'll have none and he will have 100. Keep yours.\"\r\n                            50:53\r\n                            So, even though this judgment is very clearly fair, David still thought maybe he did the unjust\r\n                            51:00\r\n                            judgment and he repented and he was asking God for forgiveness and everything.\r\n                            51:06\r\n                            You can imagine how careful... This is what made David, David. David is very special in the Quran.\r\n                            51:13\r\n                            One of the preferred, by God, prophets.\r\n                            51:23\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Right. But this is David's judgment. Dr. Khalifa: He told the fellow with the one sheep \"keep your sheep. Don't give it to him.\" A woman: Yes.\r\n                            51:31\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Then, even though this is a very clear and extreme example of a good judgment,\r\n                            51:39\r\n                            he said \"maybe, I did the wrong judgment.\" And he was repenting and asking forgiveness and...\r\n                            51:45\r\n                            I mean, our presidents back home, they kill people. Then, David just said \"keep your one sheep and he keeps his 99.\"\r\n                            51:54\r\n                            They kill people, commit murder and they steal billions of dollars.\r\n                            52:02\r\n                            Yes. A man: (unintelligible)\r\n                            52:23\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, no he wanted it. He wanted it. Maybe, he wanted to buy it.\r\n                            52:29\r\n                            A man: No, he won't Dr. Khalifa: That's okay. They wanted to mix, but he doesn't want to.\r\n                            52:39\r\n                            The fellow with the one sheep didn't want to do it. A man: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: That's not the point.\r\n                            52:51\r\n                            Yes. You got it.\r\n                            52:57\r\n                            That's correct.\r\n                            53:02\r\n                            Yes, he waited, yes, yes, this is... Yeah, he waited, he, he, he waited and he studied and he did everything. And then he judged.\r\n                            53:11\r\n                            Emily got it. And that's it. He was afraid of... he was thinking of God. \"Did he do the right judgment?\"\r\n                            53:20\r\n                            Yeah.\r\n                            53:26\r\n                            Of course. What would you do?\r\n                            53:32\r\n                            A woman: I don't know. Dr. Khalifa: Well,... A woman: I'm not in that situation. Dr. Khalifa: Well, you are now. Somebody came to you and he says \"I have one sheep and my brother has 99 sheep. And he wants to take my one sheep.\"\r\n                            53:44\r\n                            Ok, what would you do? Do you wanna tell him to give his sheep to the other guy? A woman: He can give the brother the sheep, but here everyone's money is his own.\r\n                            53:56\r\n                            If the brother, you know, is giving to his brother, they can make a business (unintelligible).\r\n                            54:03\r\n                            But if you're going... Dr. Khalifa: Okay, but the, but this fellow without the sheep, he will just sit there and do nothing.\r\n                            54:10\r\n                            At least he has one sheep to care about. He will take it in the morning to eat and bring it in the afternoon. And...\r\n                            54:17\r\n                            It's his job.\r\n                            54:25\r\n                            Parivash: I have a question. It is my understanding. I don't know if it's true.\r\n                            54:30\r\n                            About Sura 15 that... Aya 91, alright? And yeah...\r\n                            54:37\r\n                            Because of the... remember the first time, the seven pairs. Ok? And\r\n                            54:44\r\n                            I think it couldn't be the time of Muhammad but I wanna know that (unintelligible) time of Muhammad and you, but\r\n                            54:54\r\n                            my understanding is it could be... Dr. Khalifa: Seven pairs have to do with the end of the world. Parivash: Okay, no, but after that, it says\r\n                            55:01\r\n                            أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ Dr. Khalifa: [15:88] Do not be jealous of what others... Parivash: Ok. Ok. And after Parivash: [15:89] And proclaim: \"I am the manifest warner.\"\r\n                            55:09\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Parivash: [15:90] For we will also deal with the dividers.\r\n                            55:15\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yes, to accept the Quran partially. Parivash: Ok. Parivash: If it was time of Muhammad, it would say \"And Proclaim I am the messenger.\"\r\n                            55:23\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: I didn't say, I didn't say it was the time of Muhammad. Parivash: It was the...they accepted Quran only partially. At the time of Muhammad...\r\n                            55:32\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: There was no Quran. Parivash:... complete that... Dr. Khalifa: Because you're making an assumption that is not there.\r\n                            55:38\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: I didn't say it's been the time of Muhammad. I didn't say it was at the time of Muhammad.\r\n                            55:43\r\n                            Parivash: It wasn't. It couldn't be at... Dr. Khalifa: I didn't say that. Where did you get that? Parivash: No, I think my understanding is wrong. And I wanted your idea.\r\n                            55:52\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, but does it say in the translation that this is the time of Muhammad? Parviash: No.\r\n                            55:58\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: You're making the wrong assumption and then you're carrying on based on that.\r\n                            56:11\r\n                            Which happens quite often. Sometimes we make a wrong assumption and then we build on it. And we keep going on and on.\r\n                            56:17\r\n                            So I'm stopping you before you go on and on.\r\n                            56:24\r\n                            What is the footnote?\r\n                            56:46\r\n                            Parivash: I'm talking about 91. It could be...couldn't be at the time of... now.\r\n                            56:53\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: It's applicable also at the time of Muhammad. But just, I'm leaving it as it is in the Quran.\r\n                            Explanation of Heavens and Earth Vs Paradise.\r\n                            57:00\r\n                            I see what you mean. In other words, at the time of the Prophet Muhammad, the Quran was not complete. It was not in this form. Yes.\r\n                            57:08\r\n                            It has to be now. I see what you mean. Sorry.\r\n                            57:18\r\n                            Your chicken kitchen is sometimes confusing.\r\n                            57:27\r\n                            A woman: We read in the afternoon that...\r\n                            57:34\r\n                            God, God (unintelligible) but in six days, he made heaven and the earth.\r\n                            57:44\r\n                            (Unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Because he will not make it until after the judgement.\r\n                            57:53\r\n                            When all the people are called back And then the bad ones will go to Hell. So, God doesn't wanna do it now.\r\n                            58:02\r\n                            He wants to do it afterwards. God created Heaven. The heavens and the earth are different from Heaven, which is paradise.\r\n                            58:11\r\n                            God created the heavens and the earth in six days. But heaven or paradise is different from heaven. You see, the English language confuses it a little bit.\r\n                            58:21\r\n                            Because there is the heavens and the earth, which were created in seven days. And there is Paradise, which some people also call Heaven.\r\n                            58:29\r\n                            And this is already in existence. But Hell will not be created until after the Day of Judgment.\r\n                            58:38\r\n                            On the Day of Judgment. Good question. Mã Shã Allãh\r\n                            58:44\r\n                            See, the children, they pick up things. You think they're sitting there oblivious? You think this guy is oblivious, but he's observing everything.\r\n                            58:51\r\n                            Right, Hanan?\r\n                            58:58\r\n                            Mã Shã Allãh A man: And Sura 15 says\r\n                            Use of Magic for Good??\r\n                            59:03\r\n                            [15:98] You shall sing the praises of your Lord,... Is that singing like singing (unintelligible)?\r\n                            59:09\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, no, it's the English expression, meaning praise God all the time.\r\n                            59:14\r\n                            A man: It's not singing. Dr. Khalifa: If you wanna do it, do it outside of here.\r\n                            59:27\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Mani can put up with that. Does he sing a lot?\r\n                            59:33\r\n                            Not even in the shower?\r\n                            59:44\r\n                            A woman: Rashad, we previously read that Haroot and Maroot (unintelligible)\r\n                            59:51\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Magic. Witchcraft. A woman: But it says also that people used it in a bad way. Does it mean that people can use it in a good way?\r\n                            1:00:02\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No. God says \"it only brings harm, no good.\"\r\n                            1:00:10\r\n                            A woman: Either way. Dr. Khalifa: That should not be \"abuse.\"\r\n                            1:00:18\r\n                            I don't know. I have to think about it. Dr. Khalifa: But it's the statement... A man: that the jinns are...\r\n                            1:00:23\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, it's using the jinns. A man: ... on the satanic side. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            1:00:32\r\n                            Parivash: If nobody asks it then I (unintelligible).\r\n                            1:00:40\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: You see, if it's something good, it should be temporary. Like the psychic who tried to stop the train, remember?\r\n                            1:00:47\r\n                            It worked for him for a while, but then, at the course of time, the jinn said \"bye.\"\r\n                            Jinns whisper doubts examples given. God matches a believing Jinn with Believers.\r\n                            1:01:03\r\n                            Usually it's in a bad way. We have to stay away from the jinns, I know.\r\n                            1:01:10\r\n                            A woman: (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:01:15\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Right. It could never have anything to do with jinns.\r\n                            1:01:20\r\n                            A woman: Some people are curious about the things that drive them away from God Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Invariably. Yes.\r\n                            1:01:29\r\n                            Invariably, it takes them away from God. A man: So, how come (unintelligible) with the jinns?\r\n                            1:01:35\r\n                            God is the One who put them in his service. God said \"I committed the jinns to serve Solomon.\" Not only the jinns, the jinns, the birds.\r\n                            1:01:48\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Who? Karim? Karim. A woman: Do you mean that convert our jinn by...\r\n                            1:01:57\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Right. A woman: So, it would be converted and then...\r\n                            1:02:03\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: to be come a good one. You're converting him right now by reading the Quran.\r\n                            1:02:12\r\n                            When you read the Quran and think about it, our jinn is also reading the Quran at the same time and thinking about it.\r\n                            1:02:21\r\n                            And your jinn will tell you \"don't pray, don't believe this.\r\n                            1:02:30\r\n                            \"Why go through all the trouble?\" This is his job. And you tell him \"no, I'm gonna Pray five times a day because I want to be happy all my life.\"\r\n                            1:02:40\r\n                            \"I'm going to follow this because this guarantees me victory and happiness.\" And he tells you \"oh, forget it. This is all nonsense.\"\r\n                            1:02:48\r\n                            So, you continue to debate like this until you convert him, IN SHAA ALLAH. A woman: Then, what happens after that?\r\n                            1:02:55\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Then, you become friends, become identical.\r\n                            1:03:01\r\n                            A man: My question was simple. When I hear what the jinn power is I believe everything (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:03:12\r\n                            I mean, for example. But in the outside, the jinn will... Dr. Khalifa: Yes, the jinn will whisper to you.\r\n                            1:03:17\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible) believer Dr. Khalifa: Yes. A man: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Right. A man: (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:03:27\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: The jinn is telling you to sleep. A man: Yeah. A man: But my question is...\r\n                            1:03:32\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, this is all of us. Our jinn is always telling us to not to, not worship God alone.\r\n                            1:03:40\r\n                            A man: You believe all the time \"oh, I don't (unintelligible) because I have a challenge between me and him.\" Dr. Khalifa: No.\r\n                            1:03:45\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: There'll be a time when, like Karim said, there'll be a time when he's completely converted.\r\n                            1:03:51\r\n                            As a matter of fact, he can be ahead of you. Tomorrow, you're gonna be here for the Khutba, Friday prayer?\r\n                            1:03:57\r\n                            A man: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: Yes, IN SHAA ALLAH. A man: IN SHAA ALLAH. Dr. Khalifa: So, you're gonna hear an example of a jinn that is cooperating with you.\r\n                            Star signs are just observations. Manifestation of the Jinns can be a Ghost. Different heavens allegory Human Vs Tree to explain Heaven for Jinns.\r\n                            1:04:08\r\n                            A woman: Our jinn is being Muslim. Then after that, is that possible that our jinn guide us and...? Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            1:04:17\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Sometimes the jinn will be ahead of you. And the Quran, we were reading yesterday, or the day before yesterday, how God matches your companion,\r\n                            1:04:27\r\n                            matches the companion, the jinn and the human companions are matched. So, if you're destined to believe, God matches a believing jinn with you, who is also destined to believe.\r\n                            1:04:39\r\n                            A person who's destined to disbelieve, God will match a disbelieving companion.\r\n                            1:04:45\r\n                            Which makes sense. A man: Rashad, what about astrology? Isn't it a thing that jinn do that?\r\n                            1:04:52\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, this is simply observation. They notice that the sun is in the zodiac and another zodiac this and that, so something happens on earth.\r\n                            1:05:02\r\n                            It notices the people who are born under a certain sign, have certain characteristics. So, they made notes.\r\n                            1:05:09\r\n                            And they compile them and computerize them. Then, if you tell me that you're a Libra, I can tell you what your characteristics are.\r\n                            1:05:16\r\n                            You're more susceptible to colds and things like that.\r\n                            1:05:24\r\n                            They're just observations, Ok, a compilation, but it's very... it has a long way to go.\r\n                            1:05:37\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No.\r\n                            1:05:50\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: See, we cannot see the jinns. But I guess some manifestations of the jinn, people would think they're ghosts.\r\n                            1:06:03\r\n                            Parivash: Rashad, the jinn (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:06:08\r\n                            Parivash: And they, in their first life, they say, they totally admitted the Shaytan. Dr. Khalifa: Satan.\r\n                            1:06:14\r\n                            Parivash: Our difference is the human and the jinn (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:06:20\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: God gives the jinns a longer life and more ability to fly in the universe and study God's signs.\r\n                            1:06:30\r\n                            But the humans are given 7:172. Read it. 7:172, again.\r\n                            1:06:42\r\n                            A man: Rashad, (unintelligible) ability (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:06:50\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, because they already made up their minds very strongly that Satan is right.\r\n                            1:06:56\r\n                            See, here, God said to the children of Adam, not the children of Satan, not the jinns.\r\n                            1:07:07\r\n                            A man: So, did Shaytan know that he is (unintelligible)? Dr. Khalifa: Right.\r\n                            1:07:17\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Not really, no. It's just that there's a different allegorical Heaven for them.

Let us say, compare you with a tree.\r\n                            1:07:35\r\n                            You and a tree. Well, think of it as two creatures. And I'm saying \"I'm gonna put you and the tree, I'm gonna put you both in Heaven.\r\n                            1:07:43\r\n                            I'm gonna give you steak. I'm gonna give you potatoes and rice and fruit.\"\r\n                            1:07:51\r\n                            Do you think the tree will go for that?\r\n                            1:07:58\r\n                            What? Do you understand what I said?\r\n                            1:08:06\r\n                            No, you are a creature and the tree is a creature. And I'm telling you \"I'm gonna put you both in Heaven where you can eat steak every day.\"\r\n                            1:08:15\r\n                            Know what? A woman: Because the tree doesn't like the steak. Dr. Khalifa: Right.\r\n                            1:08:23\r\n                            So, the humans and the jinns are two different creatures. And God is telling us \"I'm gonna put you in gardens with grapes and pomegranates and fruits.\"\r\n                            1:08:34\r\n                            The jinns don't, the jinns don't care about that. So, God is telling them that \"you're gonna have your own Heaven with different things.\r\n                            1:08:43\r\n                            A woman: It's actually going to be... Dr. Khalifa: Yes, actually may be the same Heaven.\r\n                            1:08:55\r\n                            A woman: Are the plants' souls the same as us? Dr. Khalifa: Uhum.

Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: No.\r\n                            1:09:33\r\n                            They're creatures. Well, it's my sleeping time, brothers and sisters. So, I'm gonna retire and see you in the morning, IN SHAA ALLAH.\r\n                            1:09:40\r\n                            People: IN SHAA ALLAH. Dr. Khalifa: I got up at what time? A man: This morning? A man: 4.\r\n                            1:09:49\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, it was one o'clock. A woman: Are you working?\r\n                            1:09:55\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah. Dr. Khalifa: Well, I left home at one. So, I got here about twenty after one.\r\n                            1:10:01\r\n                            This is why people laugh at me when I say \"it's my sleeping time.\"\r\n                            \r\n                            23 Quran Study From Behrouz 1323 Sura 51 By Douglas New Era Believers Are Protected From Accidents &\r\n                            \r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ We seek refuge in God from Satan, who was the basic cause for us being here in this world.\r\n                            0:13\r\n                            And may it back...

I'd like to stop first of all and bear witness that the clouds and the winds have came and\r\n                            2:22\r\n                            they're bringing bounty outside right now.\r\n                            2:27\r\n                            And we know that that promise is true. Today, Abdullah went over some more characteristics of the code, proving\r\n                            2:41\r\n                            that when Allah says He has preserved the Quran, He's preserved it.\r\n                            2:46\r\n                            That Allah has all knowledge and it doesn't make any difference what a person does or they don't do,\r\n                            2:51\r\n                            what disbelievers believe, feel, and think. It doesn't really make any difference what type of power that a person has in this world,\r\n                            2:59\r\n                            influence or whatever. They simply cannot overwhelm Allah. He knows what they have and what they don't have and he controls everything, their thoughts.\r\n                            3:09\r\n                            And just like Allah brings the rain, the bounty, He brings the life by His command.\r\n                            3:17\r\n                            And it's distributed equally. So then in one way or another, all of us are nourished by the water.\r\n                            3:28\r\n                            The very process in creation by which rain is produced is a miracle in itself\r\n                            3:36\r\n                            in terms of the orbit of the earth within a specific angle in relationship to the sun and the change of the seasons.\r\n                            3:46\r\n                            Many people don't know that the 24-hour difference in heat and cold in the earth causes the winds to flow on the earth.\r\n                            3:57\r\n                            That's one of the things that causes the winds to flow, the alternation of light and darkness,\r\n                            4:03\r\n                            of the heat and cold. And just imagine what it would be like if it was night all the time or day all the time.\r\n                            4:11\r\n                            These laws that Allah has created. These winds would not travel as they do in bringing the bounty to us.\r\n                            4:22\r\n                            [51:5] What is promised to you is true. God is telling us, as sure as we can see the rain in front of our eyes, as sure as we can see\r\n                            4:33\r\n                            the majesty of the clouds in the sky and how it becomes saturated and it falls,\r\n                            4:43\r\n                            this is true. What God promises is true. And the Judgment is sure to come.\r\n                            4:54\r\n                            Why do we know that it's sure to come? Because God tells us it's sure to come. That's one of the reasons.\r\n                            5:00\r\n                            As was pointed out in the Khutba, the minimum requirement to be a Muslim is to submit,\r\n                            5:07\r\n                            to submit to what God tells us and what He teaches us.\r\n                            5:16\r\n                            One of the most recent discoveries concerning the time of the Day of Judgment was made the other\r\n                            5:22\r\n                            day by Mahmoud and I think sister Ihsan and Emily.\r\n                            5:28\r\n                            Verse... Sura 72 verse 27 speaks to the fact that only Allah gives His messenger any knowledge of the past, present, and future.\r\n                            5:48\r\n                            Only the messengers that He chooses may be given certain information concerning the past or the future.\r\n                            5:56\r\n                            What Mahmoud and sister Ihsan and Emily had done was they took the gematrical value,\r\n                            6:03\r\n                            the gematrical, I guess it's the gematrical value of the name Rashad and the name Khalifa\r\n                            6:10\r\n                            and the Sura number and the verse number and they added, they put these numbers in a series.\r\n                            6:16\r\n                            Just like Abdullah showed us today when we saw the chapter and the verse and the chapter, he put them in a straight line and it's divisible by 19.\r\n                            6:25\r\n                            So, not only do we know that God's messenger is given the knowledge of the future, we also know that God willed that His Messenger of the Covenant be given knowledge of the future.\r\n                            6:35\r\n                            And if people say \"well, there are millions of individuals named Rashad,\" okay, because you can just take the value of the word \"Rashad\" and put it next to chapter 72,\r\n                            6:47\r\n                            next to verse 27 and it too is a multiple of 19.\r\n                            6:52\r\n                            But there is only one Rashad, Khalifa.\r\n                            6:59\r\n                            Confirmation of the time of the Day of Judgment and what God promises us is true.\r\n                            7:09\r\n                            [51:7] Despite the perfectly created sky.

And just like Prophet Abraham. He looked up at the stars and he realized that this was not an accident.\r\n                            8:21\r\n                            These stars and planets could not be positioned in the sky to produce this beauty, to control\r\n                            8:30\r\n                            the movements of other heavenly bodies. There had to be some higher being responsible for this.\r\n                            8:40\r\n                            And God tells us in the Sura, despite these signs, these magnificent signs that are right before us.\r\n                            8:47\r\n                            When we turn on the faucet, we have a sign. We drink it. Without it, we die,\r\n                            8:54\r\n                            let alone look at the sky. There is dispute. There is confusion.\r\n                            9:07\r\n                            Why is there... what are some of the reasons for the dispute and the confusion?\r\n                            9:13\r\n                            Well, we know that this is Satan's kingdom. He's incompetent. He thought that he could be a god.\r\n                            9:22\r\n                            He entertained thoughts that he could run a universe, a world, with creatures,\r\n                            9:29\r\n                            and God put him to the test.\r\n                            9:34\r\n                            And his incompetence, along with individual decisions, intentions, create this doubt.\r\n                            9:46\r\n                            Although Satan was very incompetent, he is also a master. He's a master deceiver.\r\n                            9:54\r\n                            He's extremely powerful. He's a hypnotist, or whatever names we want to use. He retained the power and ability to mislead us.\r\n                            10:07\r\n                            And he has dedicated himself to that. That's his purpose for existence, to mislead as many of\r\n                            10:13\r\n                            us as possible, to keep us disputing about the truth and confused.\r\n                            10:21\r\n                            We know many times in areas where there are droughts. They will spray the clouds.\r\n                            10:28\r\n                            They will seed the clouds in an effort to make it rain.\r\n                            10:34\r\n                            Seeding the clouds in itself does not make it rain.\r\n                            10:39\r\n                            There's no conclusive proof at all in the first place that seeding a cloud will make it rain or not, because Allah still controls the processes by which it rains.\r\n                            10:50\r\n                            But what man learns is he learns some of the laws and principles governing rainfall.\r\n                            10:59\r\n                            But he forgets the lawmaker. He learns laws. He learns rules, but somehow Satan is hypnotizing where he can't make the\r\n                            11:09\r\n                            logical connection between the law and the rule and the lawmaker and the ruler.\r\n                            11:22\r\n                            So he disputes.\r\n                            11:28\r\n                            Any questions on the first eight verses?\r\n                            11:33\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Well, we need to comment on the first, on the title of the Sura.\r\n                            11:41\r\n                            You know, a believer appreciates God differently from people who are unaware,\r\n                            11:47\r\n                            or who are not strong believers. You can see here that the title of the Sura is the Winds.\r\n                            11:54\r\n                            And we learn from the first few verses that the winds, their main job is to carry clouds\r\n                            12:00\r\n                            and bring bounties. We need that water. So, in order to appreciate God and these simple words, just imagine yourself sending ten astronauts to space.\r\n                            12:14\r\n                            You, sending ten astronauts to space, and you tell them \"okay, you're gonna be out\r\n                            12:20\r\n                            there for three years, and when you need water, I made an invention in the spaceship,\r\n                            12:25\r\n                            so there'll be these clouds on top of you, and they will give you water.\" You're sending them into space.\r\n                            12:33\r\n                            And you devise that system that will give them water, clean water.\r\n                            12:38\r\n                            When they pollute the water they have on the spaceship, it's gonna, you know, one of...\r\n                            12:44\r\n                            number one purification processes is distillation.\r\n                            12:49\r\n                            So, when they pollute, their own water is gonna evaporate, it's gonna be pure water, and come down again. So, you tell them that to assure them that they will have enough water supply for three years, or five years, ten years, or whatever.\r\n                            13:00\r\n                            You're sending them. Just imagine that. See, God sent this spaceship with five billion astronauts.\r\n                            13:07\r\n                            You and me, we are astronauts. That's right. And God gave us this system. God devised this system, where the water evaporates\r\n                            13:17\r\n                            and then comes down by... the winds drive the clouds here. How far are we from the ocean?\r\n                            13:24\r\n                            We're far from the ocean. But these clouds came to us from the ocean, by the wind.\r\n                            13:30\r\n                            It's a traveling system. And it sends down pure water. You appreciate God if you think, if you imagine sending ten astronauts in space and you tell them\r\n                            13:42\r\n                            \"I'm going to give you the exact percentage of oxygen for you to breathe.\"\r\n                            13:48\r\n                            Now in 1967, we were technologically advanced people. 1967.\r\n                            13:54\r\n                            But we put three astronauts in a capsule in an atmosphere of 100% oxygen.\r\n                            14:02\r\n                            Pure oxygen, right? To breathe. And all it took was a spark.\r\n                            14:08\r\n                            And the three astronauts were combusted. Ed White, Gus Grissom, and Roger Chaffee.\r\n                            14:15\r\n                            They are not with us today because of that. We were really advanced in science.\r\n                            14:23\r\n                            But when you put anything in pure oxygen and light a match, everything would be combusted. Everything.\r\n                            14:29\r\n                            Everything organic, that is. In fact, this is for chemists.\r\n                            14:35\r\n                            If any chemist is here, this is the last thing you do to find out if there is, for example, radioactivity in the ashes of anything.\r\n                            14:42\r\n                            You put it in a closed thing there. You fill it with 100% oxygen.\r\n                            14:48\r\n                            And you create a spark. And everything will be combusted into ashes.\r\n                            14:54\r\n                            This is what happened to the three astronauts. And this is why God didn't give us 100% oxygen.\r\n                            15:00\r\n                            We have 20% oxygen. The rest is nitrogen. And this is what they do now\r\n                            15:05\r\n                            when they send astronauts into space.\r\n                            15:10\r\n                            But they learned the hard way. So, despite our...\r\n                            15:16\r\n                            I mean, we were sending people to the moon. And we couldn't give them the correct atmosphere.\r\n                            15:24\r\n                            So, these few verses here will make us appreciate God if we think of sending our own astronauts into space.\r\n                            15:37\r\n                            Of course, you know how the oxygen is generated for us. We breathe it, and we get out carbon dioxide, which is not good for breathing.\r\n                            15:45\r\n                            So, God designed the trees, so they will take carbon dioxide and turn it into apples and give us the oxygen.\r\n                            15:51\r\n                            They take the carbon and give us back the oxygen. How do you like that for a system?\r\n                            15:57\r\n                            Can you do that for your astronauts? You tell your 10 astronauts \"you're gonna be out there for 10 years, and you're gonna to breathe out carbon dioxide, so I'm gonna give you\r\n                            16:08\r\n                            a couple of... I invented these plants or something that will take your carbon dioxide, turn it into food for you, and you'll get the oxygen back.\"\r\n                            16:20\r\n                            Such is God's creation. And you think it's all evolution, right?\r\n                            16:32\r\n                            Are there any questions on these? The winds and the rains, bounties.\r\n                            16:39\r\n                            We're talking only about the 5 billion human beings. You forget the 10 Decillion ants, and the... about 200 Billion mice.\r\n                            16:49\r\n                            Ihsan?\r\n                            16:56\r\n                            There may be a few of them in this mosque, running around. The name scares her. This is why I said that.\r\n                            17:04\r\n                            Okay, back to Douglas. Yes, Catherine. Catherine: (unintelligible)\r\n                            17:13\r\n                            Catherine: But there's a verse in the Quran where God talks about those (unintelligible)\r\n                            17:22\r\n                            Catherine: Is that allegorical? Dr. Khalifa: No. Did you take a bath today? Catherine: Yes.\r\n                            17:27\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: What did you use? You used water. Yeah. That's it. That's not allegorical. You actually used water.\r\n                            17:36\r\n                            Catherine: How is that washing (unintelligible)\r\n                            17:41\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Oh, oh, oh. The verse says \"...removes the devil's, the devil's touch.\"\r\n                            17:53\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Well, I have to think about that. Edip: Was that from the Bible? Dr. Khalifa: No, it's in the Quran, yeah.\r\n                            18:03\r\n                            Well, let's... I can think of a few things.\r\n                            18:08\r\n                            A woman: I think your translation (unintelligible) kind of I understand it is probably (unintelligible).\r\n                            18:15\r\n                            I think your translation is that He removes the devil's curse and He sends down water to cleanse you (unintelligible)\r\n                            18:22\r\n                            or something like that. So, it's not... Dr. Khalifa: It's not connected? Yeah. A man: Yeah. Dr. Khalifa: Ok.\r\n                            18:30\r\n                            A woman: I believe this is wrong, I think. Sura 8, verse 11.\r\n                            18:35\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Do you wanna read it? [8:11] He causes slumber to pacify you, and He sent down water from the sky to clean you therewith and removed the devil's curse from you... Dr. Khalifa: And.\r\n                            18:45\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: It's a separate issue. A woman: [8:11] ...He reassured your hearts and strengthened your foothold.\r\n                            18:51\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: These are all separate issues. But one of the things we use water for is taking a bath between ourselves.\r\n                            19:00\r\n                            A man: Which verse? A woman: In Sura 8, verse 11.\r\n                            19:06\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: You can tell your astronauts \"when the water comes down on your spaceship, you can take a bath. A woman: (unintelligible).\r\n                            19:26\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: George. George, go ahead. Douglas: Why?\r\n                            19:37\r\n                            Douglas: However,... Dr. Khalifa: We're taking advantage of his nervousness.\r\n                            19:42\r\n                            Douglas: [51:9] However deviating that those who are supposed to deviate. [51:10] Woe to the falsifiers.\r\n                            19:48\r\n                            [51:11] Who are heedless in their blunders. [51:12] They ask \"When is the Day of Judgment?\"\r\n                            19:55\r\n                            [51:13] That is the day when they suffer in Hell. [51:14] Taste your retribution; this is what you defiantly challenged.\r\n                            20:05\r\n                            [51:15] As for the righteous, they have deserved gardens and springs. [51:16] They receive their Lord's blessings in return for their works.\r\n                            20:14\r\n                            [51:17] Rarely did they sleep the whole night. [51:18] At dawn, they used to implore for forgiveness.\r\n                            20:22\r\n                            [51:19] A portion of their money was set aside for the needy and deprived.\r\n                            20:29\r\n                            [51:20] In the earth, there are signs for those who are certain [51:21] Even within yourselves; do you not see?\r\n                            20:38\r\n                            [51:22] In the heaven is your provision, and everything that is promised to you.\r\n                            20:44\r\n                            [51:23] By the Lord of the heaven and the earth, this is as real as the fact that you speak.\r\n                            20:51\r\n                            In verses 9 through 23, God is telling us in verse 9 that the deviators are doing exactly what they're supposed to do.\r\n                            21:03\r\n                            And one of the reasons why they are supposed to do this is because they've chosen to do it.\r\n                            21:11\r\n                            They have chosen to follow Satan instead of submit to God alone.\r\n                            21:22\r\n                            They've chosen to deviate and because they deviate, they incur.\r\n                            21:28\r\n                            They're going to meet the consequences of it. And the consequences of it as we know are Hell.\r\n                            21:37\r\n                            And we know in this so-called modern age, scientific age, people like to appear what\r\n                            21:44\r\n                            they think is intelligent and have scientific minds. So, there are a lot of people whom you say \"you believe in Heaven and Hell?\"\r\n                            21:50\r\n                            \"Well, I don't know. I'm not too sure about that. There's not too much proof about it.\" People like to pretend as if... some people like to pretend as if they need more information\r\n                            22:00\r\n                            before they can be confident that there is a Day of Judgment. Well, if you say \"there's a Day of Judgment.\" \"When is it coming?\"\r\n                            22:10\r\n                            Well, now, they've asked the question. They continually ask the question. And God knows they were gonna ask the question. And now they've received an answer.\r\n                            22:18\r\n                            And they still don't want it. Now, God has revealed through the code when the Day of Judgment will come and they still do not want it.\r\n                            22:30\r\n                            So, they are deviating because they're supposed to deviate. Their deviation is not because they are sincerely seeking the truth and they're just simply ignorant\r\n                            22:39\r\n                            or they just don't know where to look and when to look. We're told in Sura 74 that the code and everything associated with the code exposes the hypocrites.\r\n                            22:51\r\n                            It exposes the nonbelievers.\r\n                            23:00\r\n                            You know, as we grew up and we were children, every now and then we may,\r\n                            23:06\r\n                            we may, for example, like we're driving down the street of the road and we'll see a warning sign \"don't turn left.\"\r\n                            23:12\r\n                            Somebody said \"you'd. better be careful. Don't walk that way anymore.\" We're surrounded by warnings.\r\n                            23:19\r\n                            We don't take them all with the same degree of seriousness.\r\n                            23:24\r\n                            Many of them we totally ignore. We feel \"well, it's not gonna happen to me.\"\r\n                            23:30\r\n                            And this is the way these disbelievers and falsifiers are.\r\n                            23:38\r\n                            When they're warned about the Day of Judgment and they're warned about Hell, to them,\r\n                            23:44\r\n                            it doesn't make any difference. God says in the Quran \"the human being is prone to only believe in what is in front of his face.\"\r\n                            23:58\r\n                            He only wants to believe what he thinks he can feel and touch in front of his face.\r\n                            24:04\r\n                            And one of the things that I was thinking about the other day is when we\r\n                            24:11\r\n                            when we went along with Satan and didn't come out and declare that only God is god and that He is absolute,\r\n                            24:21\r\n                            we were then put in this world. We could no longer stand the presence of God because we entertained doubt in His power.\r\n                            24:31\r\n                            And when we were brought into this world, our bodies were made visible to us. Now if we listen to what God is telling us, He's saying our bodies were made visible to us\r\n                            24:44\r\n                            when we came into this world. Well, that implies that our bodies and everything else that's visible to us in this world\r\n                            24:53\r\n                            is not permanent or is not absolute because we came from somewhere else that made our bodies visible\r\n                            25:02\r\n                            and made us see the things in front of our face. See?\r\n                            25:07\r\n                            So, what happens? Satan deceives us and whispers to us and we begin to believe that\r\n                            25:17\r\n                            the only thing that's real is what is visible to us despite the proof.\r\n                            25:25\r\n                            So, God in His mercy and His absoluteness revealed a miraculous code, revealed an irrefutable proof\r\n                            25:39\r\n                            in the highest form of, you know, scientific language, mathematics, right in front of his face\r\n                            25:48\r\n                            and he still denies it because he is supposed to deviate.\r\n                            25:57\r\n                            And we see that as a result, the people, the falsifiers have to taste their retribution.\r\n                            26:03\r\n                            And they will suffer in Hell because they defiantly challenged all of the signs of God.\r\n                            26:10\r\n                            They defiantly challenged the revelation. They defied and opposed God's messenger and we know that the Muhammadans, the false Muslims,\r\n                            26:22\r\n                            defiantly opposed the miracle of the Quran. And we know that they also defiantly opposed\r\n                            26:30\r\n                            Rashad as the Messenger of the Covenant.\r\n                            26:35\r\n                            In contrast to these people, the righteous will be rewarded and as we know the descriptions of\r\n                            26:44\r\n                            Heaven and Hell in the Quran are allegorical. They are termed in ways that make us think of pleasure and contentment and happiness, life,\r\n                            26:58\r\n                            fruit, well-being, a garden with water and springs and flowers and food, but we know that\r\n                            27:05\r\n                            we cannot describe Heaven or Hell.\r\n                            27:12\r\n                            What is the bargain? What is the bargain for those who are righteous, who heed the signs of God. They receive their Lord's blessings?\r\n                            27:23\r\n                            There is obviously no greater bargain, but only a believer is guided to see that.\r\n                            27:29\r\n                            Only a person who submits and desires to submit to God is guided to recognize that that is the greatest bargain,\r\n                            27:36\r\n                            that is the greatest promise possible in this world.\r\n                            27:42\r\n                            And it's not free. We're told in the Quran \"do not think that you are going to be allowed to say you believe without being tested.\"\r\n                            27:55\r\n                            We all have to go through tests in life, different circumstances, situations to increase that belief.\r\n                            28:03\r\n                            And, IN SHAA ALLAH, hopefully until it approaches a point of certainty.\r\n                            28:11\r\n                            We don't question what Allah says in the Quran. We don't question His signs with certainty.\r\n                            28:21\r\n                            Mahmoud and I were talking the other day and when you read about the descriptions of the, of Heaven\r\n                            28:28\r\n                            for the believers, in light of the fact that we know that every letter of the Quran is divinely fixed and from Allah,\r\n                            28:35\r\n                            we know that every statement in the Quran is true. We are certain that every statement of the Quran is true.\r\n                            28:42\r\n                            And we were kind of laughing the other day saying that it's a wonder that believers don't commit suicide\r\n                            28:48\r\n                            to get to Heaven as fast as they can, you know, because we know that it's true.\r\n                            28:55\r\n                            No. What are some of the things that the righteous do in order to get this reward?\r\n                            29:06\r\n                            We're told that they don't, during the night or after sunset, they Pray.\r\n                            29:12\r\n                            They make their Evening Prayer, their Night Prayer. Or they spend their time reading the Quran or some form of worship, not the entire night,\r\n                            29:20\r\n                            but they don't spend their night in idle play or things of no benefit to them.\r\n                            29:34\r\n                            And at dawn, at Fajr, wake up and make the Fajr Salat.\r\n                            29:40\r\n                            The righteous recite their Prayers five times a day because they know and they understand that\r\n                            29:50\r\n                            making their Salat is contact with God. Douglas: It's contact and it's building up credits and their soul is growing so that their soul...\r\n                            30:03\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: ...yeah a lot of... Douglas: Okay, I don't know. I don't really know the details of that. Dr. Sabahi: No, this is an example for the phenomenon that...\r\n                            30:11\r\n                            Douglas: I'll give you an example. Dr. Sabahi: ....but you don't see that. Douglas: I'll give you an example. None of us have ever seen an x-ray, but we know what happens if we get exposed to too many of them.\r\n                            30:22\r\n                            Gamma rays. In other words, man is capable of learning that certain things exist\r\n                            30:30\r\n                            that he cannot directly perceive because of the effect that it has on him. If he can rule out all of the possibilities of anything else in the environment,\r\n                            30:40\r\n                            he knows that there's something there that's causing this cancer or\r\n                            30:45\r\n                            causing this genetic mutation to take place. And he tries to learn and discover it. And if God wills, he learns that there is some\r\n                            30:53\r\n                            invisible energy, an x-ray or a gamma ray that passes through his body or something like that.\r\n                            31:00\r\n                            He can't see it himself. Just like when a person goes to the doctor to get x-rays, when you see the picture, that's not the ray itself.\r\n                            31:10\r\n                            See? That's an after-image or a trace that is actually seen.\r\n                            31:16\r\n                            So, the doctor or the nurse looks at the trace and knows that that was an x-ray or a particular type of ray that passes through the person.\r\n                            31:25\r\n                            So, one of the ways we know that, well obviously this is a proof that all that exists isn't\r\n                            31:34\r\n                            limited obviously to what we directly perceive. Because so much around us affects us and influences and we cannot directly perceive.\r\n                            31:44\r\n                            Douglas: Does that, does that... Dr. Sabahi: Yeah, just, I think you quoted another verse that God is saying this and then you (unintelligible) by explaining...\r\n                            31:55\r\n                            Douglas: I was saying you what I would refer to as a fact that like if we look up in the ceiling and we see that light,\r\n                            32:02\r\n                            that's because of certain, right, stimuli. That's because of certain colors and\r\n                            32:08\r\n                            light waves that are hitting our eye, right? That has to do with the light waves and nervous\r\n                            32:14\r\n                            impulses and what have you that eventually lead to the sense that that is a light.\r\n                            32:19\r\n                            I see the light. Okay?\r\n                            32:24\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: But you don't see electricity. Douglas: Right, I don't see the electric. I can't see the actual light wave.\r\n                            32:30\r\n                            See? So, in that sense what I was trying to say is that man really limits himself\r\n                            32:36\r\n                            when he says that he only wants to believe what he can see. Dr. Sabahi: But we know that a lot of people do that, especially these days to advance in science.\r\n                            32:45\r\n                            That's what, that's what makes science advance. When people see things that physically you cannot see it, but if you use up your brain\r\n                            32:57\r\n                            and brain power and imagination, you can see things that (unintelligible) But some people can do it.\r\n                            33:03\r\n                            And that's difference between (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: You're in trouble, Douglas.

I mean, we just don't know. We have no idea how these things happen. And we do it.\r\n                            34:02\r\n                            Four-year-old children do it and two-year-old children do it. And it's language.\r\n                            34:08\r\n                            (unintelligible)\r\n                            34:15\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: This is mentioned specifically as a great miracle in the Koran, you know, the language. Just go to Europe.\r\n                            34:22\r\n                            Martha: So, we don't doubt it.

Douglas: Lessons from the past: Abraham.\r\n                            36:08\r\n                            Have you narrated... Excuse me. [51:24] Have you noted the narration about Abraham's honorable guests?\r\n                            36:13\r\n                            [51:25] When they entered, they said \"Peace.\" And he said, \"Peace to you, strangers!\" [51:26] He then asked his family to prepare a fattened calf.\r\n                            36:22\r\n                            [51:27] He offered it to them, but they did not eat. [51:28] He became wary of them. They said, \"Do not be afraid,\" and they gave him good news of a knowledgeable son.\r\n                            36:34\r\n                            [51:29] His wife came in astonishment, pointing at her face and saying: \"I am a sterile old woman.\"\r\n                            36:42\r\n                            [51:30] They said, \"Your Lord said thus. He is the Most Wise, the Omniscient.\"\r\n                            36:51\r\n                            These honorable guests that came to see Abraham were angels. They were actually on their way to Gomorrah, Sodom and Gomorrah.\r\n                            37:00\r\n                            They were commissioned to go and destroy Sodom and Gomorrah.\r\n                            37:06\r\n                            Because the people of Lot had reached the point of no return, in terms of their opposition against God.\r\n                            37:13\r\n                            The practice of homosexuality and other kinds of wickedness. And so, their destruction was already written.\r\n                            37:20\r\n                            It was already predetermined. And when they went to Abraham's house, he gave them the greeting and welcome as a believer.\r\n                            37:31\r\n                            As we know, God commands us in the Quran to greet the people with a hearty greeting, with a,\r\n                            37:37\r\n                            to give people a sense of welcome. And they returned it.\r\n                            37:44\r\n                            But when he offered them the food, they didn't eat it. And at this particular time, in Abraham's culture, whenever you went to someone's house and\r\n                            37:54\r\n                            they offered you of their table and you did not eat it, this would arouse suspicion and sometimes fear.\r\n                            38:00\r\n                            Because a guest should return, a guest should, you know, eat of the offering that the host meant.\r\n                            38:07\r\n                            And he became somewhat worried as to who they were and what they wanted.\r\n                            38:14\r\n                            And as we see here, they told him not to be afraid. And they told him that he would have a son by his wife, Sarah.\r\n                            38:25\r\n                            And she could not believe it, obviously, because of her age. And she asked in a different way the same question that Mary asked.\r\n                            38:36\r\n                            When the angel went to her and told her that she was gonna have a son. And we know in Sura 4, she said \"How can I have a son when no man has touched me?\"\r\n                            38:47\r\n                            And the angel let her know that Allah could cause life and create the birth of a child\r\n                            38:53\r\n                            or the conception of a child in the womb of a woman anytime He wills. He created Adam and Eve out of nothing.\r\n                            39:06\r\n                            And I think this was Isaac. Dr. Khalifa: Right. Douglas: This was the birth of Isaac. Douglas: And this was a miracle as well.\r\n                            39:13\r\n                            The birth of Isaac was a miracle.\r\n                            39:27\r\n                            So, we see that Abraham... God blessed Abraham with many, many sons.\r\n                            39:32\r\n                            We knew... We know that in the Quran, God told him to place four pieces of a bird on different hills.\r\n                            39:41\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Four birds. Douglas: four birds on different hills and called them together and they would come.\r\n                            39:46\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Many pieces of four birds. Douglas: Here we have his wife having a child well beyond the age which is normally possible for a woman to bear a child.\r\n                            39:59\r\n                            We have the influence of Satan in the dream where he thought he was told to sacrifice Ismail.\r\n                            40:12\r\n                            We also have the miracle when Abraham's father was such a wicked, he was so so defiant, so arrogant and so wicked\r\n                            40:21\r\n                            when Abraham confronted him that he actually built a fire to cremate him, to cremate his own son.\r\n                            40:32\r\n                            And we know in the Quran that Abraham sat in the fire until the flames died down and he walked out.\r\n                            40:41\r\n                            The power of God, the power of Allah. Douglas: Blessed with many miracles, many signs.\r\n                            40:55\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, Ismail.\r\n                            41:02\r\n                            Douglas: Any questions or comments?\r\n                            41:12\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: There you said it, his only son. Isaac was never the only son.\r\n                            41:17\r\n                            You said the truth right there. A woman: But isn't that the reason they say it is because Isaac was his only legitimate son, but we know why.\r\n                            41:25\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: This is how they justify it. A woman: But it still... Dr. Khalifa: It didn't say \"take your only legitimate son.\" It said \"take your only son,\" even if he's illegitimate.\"\r\n                            41:35\r\n                            But he was not illegitimate. Did you say \"you take your only son\" or \"your only legitimate son?\"\r\n                            41:41\r\n                            A woman: According to the Bible, (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: No.\r\n                            41:46\r\n                            Somebody, of course, the Jews and the Christians believe it was Isaac. But that's a racial, that's a racial distortion.\r\n                            41:55\r\n                            They said \"take your only son, Isaac,\" So, they made a boo-boo there, because Isaac was never the only son.\r\n                            42:03\r\n                            So, when you tell them, when you confront them with that only son business, because Ishmael was 14 years older than Isaac.\r\n                            42:11\r\n                            They tell you \"oh, it's because Isaac was the only legitimate son.\" I said \"OK, let's look at the Bible.\" And the Bible consistently calls Ishmael Abraham's son until Abraham dies. And then they say\r\n                            42:22\r\n                            \"when Abraham died, his two sons, Ishmael and Isaac, buried him.\"\r\n                            42:27\r\n                            So, there's no way out.\r\n                            42:34\r\n                            No. No, he didn't. No, you read it in some novel.\r\n                            42:42\r\n                            From who? A woman: It's in the first book of the Bible. I don't know. Dr. Khalifa: No, no, it's not, it's not in Genesis.\r\n                            42:52\r\n                            OK, Abraham had... I mean, Sarah was sterile. She didn't have anything but Isaac.\r\n                            43:02\r\n                            Yeah, there were lots of novels that he said he married this and that.\r\n                            43:13\r\n                            OK. If he had any other children, they're irrelevant, because the Quran and the Bible mention only Ishmael and Isaac.\r\n                            43:23\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Nobody else. A woman: Right, because then the Bible says when Abraham died... Dr. Khalifa: His two sons...\r\n                            43:28\r\n                            A woman: And that would be an internal contradiction, because there is another mention of other sons in that, right in the Bible.\r\n                            43:35\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: I don't think so. I don't remember. But anyway, this is the verse in Genesis 22,\r\n                            43:44\r\n                            A woman: I'm saying that... Dr. Khalifa: In Genesis 22, around 25, it says \"when Abraham died, his two sons, Ishmael and Isaac, buried him.\"\r\n                            43:54\r\n                            So, Ishmael was Abraham's son. He was the only son of Abraham for 14 years.\r\n                            44:00\r\n                            Isaac was never the only son. A woman: Ok. What would be an (unintelligible) Isaac?\r\n                            44:08\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Isaac is the father of the Jews. Ishmael is the father of the Arabs. The Jews wrote the... I mean, played around with the Genesis, the Torah.\r\n                            44:17\r\n                            A woman: So, the idea is that they just wanted the miracle to be a miracle with Isaac?\r\n                            44:23\r\n                            (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Right. They didn't want anything to Ishmael to have anything to to do with anything.\r\n                            44:31\r\n                            So, they made a big mistake, just like the two verses in the Quran. Exactly. They made a glaring error.\r\n                            44:40\r\n                            And they tried to correct it in the newer editions of the Bible. They say \"take your only one.\"\r\n                            44:48\r\n                            Trying very hard, but they make it worse. Your only one what? Donkey? Or...\r\n                            45:02\r\n                            A woman: Ishamael will... How could I... Ishmael lived... God commanded Abraham to send them away.\r\n                            45:10\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: It was just another town. Dr. Khalifa: It was just another town.\r\n                            45:18\r\n                            A woman: Because I was wondering a period of (unintelligible) Ishameal (unintelligible).\r\n                            45:27\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: About three or four weeks. Three or four weeks at a time.\r\n                            45:40\r\n                            Ok. Back to Douglas. And 31.\r\n                            45:46\r\n                            Douglas: Sodom and Gomorrah. [51:31] Abraham said, \"Where are you going, O messengers?\"\r\n                            45:51\r\n                            [51:32] They said, \"We have been dispatched to guilty people. [51:33] \"We are to shower them with stones of clay.\r\n                            45:58\r\n                            [51:34] \"Marked at your Lord for the transgressors.\" [51:35] We then delivered all the believers.\r\n                            46:05\r\n                            [51:36] We found only one house of Muslim submitters therein. [51:37] We set it up as a lesson for anyone who fears the painful retribution.\r\n                            46:16\r\n                            Abraham knew that they were messengers of God. That in this context, angels are messengers of God. They carry warning.\r\n                            46:26\r\n                            They carry the revelations, the knowledge, and they also carry out commands from God.\r\n                            46:34\r\n                            It's interesting in terms of the Armenia, the earthquake in Armenia. After the devastating earthquake, they had a lot of people on the news conjecturing.\r\n                            46:43\r\n                            And one of the major conjectures they came up with was that Armenia is an earthquake fault. It's a fault area.\r\n                            46:50\r\n                            They begin to conjecture. I mean, there's nothing wrong with theorizing, but what we find is that when these disasters take place,\r\n                            46:58\r\n                            most people don't, well, at least the people who are allegedly the ones who are so called experts or the people who are paid to give their opinion, they make no mention of God.\r\n                            47:06\r\n                            That doesn't mean that some of the people don't, but they seem to be locked up or blocked out\r\n                            47:13\r\n                            at any suggestion that there is a greater power at work that causes these devastations,\r\n                            47:20\r\n                            let alone produces the bounty and benefit. They refuse to believe that there is a God, an intelligence, that this is by design,\r\n                            47:29\r\n                            that there are laws and rules. They wanna believe that it's either by haphazard, you see, or\r\n                            47:38\r\n                            simply due to some malfunction or something off in the earth's structure, just as an example.\r\n                            47:48\r\n                            And the messenger angels were dispatched to the people of Sodom and Gomorrah. And we know that they were showered with volcanoes, tremendous earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\r\n                            48:00\r\n                            And it completely destroyed that area of land, totally. It was so much devastation, fire, and heat that we know that the salt plains,\r\n                            48:12\r\n                            it created miles of salt plains where there has been tremendous heat.\r\n                            48:20\r\n                            And it's proof in verse 34 that these types of disasters are commanded by Allah.\r\n                            48:31\r\n                            And the people who die in these disasters are already determined. They're already identified.\r\n                            48:39\r\n                            In other words, only God controls the time of death, and also people who are disbelievers\r\n                            48:45\r\n                            are identified by God, and this is one of the things we see in verse 34, [51:34] \"Marked at your Lord for the transgressors.\"\r\n                            48:53\r\n                            That these stones, volcanic ash, this heat, this lava, all of this was marked.\r\n                            49:01\r\n                            No transgressor, not a single transgressor could leave Sodom and Gomorrah.\r\n                            49:08\r\n                            Just a small family of believers who were with Lot were saved.\r\n                            49:20\r\n                            And it doesn't make any difference if you've got seismograph in your front, in your living room\r\n                            49:33\r\n                            to tell you that there are tremors in the earth. I mean, I'm saying it doesn't make any difference what kind of alarm system you've got.\r\n                            49:41\r\n                            Your best alarm system, and I'm not dismissing that, I'm saying the best alarm system is\r\n                            49:47\r\n                            submitting to God alone in this life, period. Because we know that God is the One that controls all things.\r\n                            49:54\r\n                            God controls, you know, circumstances. A human being is supposed to take precautions, use his or her intelligence,\r\n                            50:03\r\n                            but to also understand that God controls all things. You can have all the alarm systems and safety devices and all kinds of things you want,\r\n                            50:12\r\n                            but if a circumstance is to befall you, or you were to come upon a certain circumstance,\r\n                            50:18\r\n                            there's nothing going to do to stop it from happening, if it has been already written.\r\n                            50:26\r\n                            And God says in verse 37 that the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah was set up as a lesson.\r\n                            50:34\r\n                            Not only for a lesson for the survivors with Lot, but for all time,\r\n                            50:40\r\n                            our generation and generations to come. Because those soft plains are still there for anyone to see and to reflect on the magnitude of that disaster.\r\n                            50:53\r\n                            And if someone says \"well, what brought this about or what caused it?\" Well, again, we know. We know that the code has confirmed that every word and sentence in the Quran is true.\r\n                            51:06\r\n                            It's fact. And when a person is given the opportunity to be exposed to the code, to all of the information,\r\n                            51:14\r\n                            and they sincerely want to believe, they know that the Quran is from God. And if God...God tells us what was behind the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.\r\n                            51:28\r\n                            Are there any questions or comments? A woman: I'm just listening to the news of Armenia\r\n                            51:33\r\n                            I'm hearing that in Armenia, now they're celebrating Christmas (unintelligible) service.\r\n                            51:40\r\n                            And during the service, they were saying, they're preparing it for Jonah's (unintelligible)\r\n                            51:45\r\n                            They believe (unintelligible) was saved. And nothing in the earth is permanent.\r\n                            51:51\r\n                            You know, it's interesting. They're talking about how Jesus found us (unintelligible).\r\n                            Sodom and Gomorrah, we bring destruction upon ourselves, Parents take their children out of God’s protection. God assigns Souls to certain environments. Discussions on AIDS.\r\n                            52:00\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: They don't learn, do they? A woman: No. Dr. Khalifa: Haven't learned a thing.\r\n                            52:06\r\n                            People bring their destruction on themselves. We know that Sodom and Gomorrah, they were all corrupted beyond reform.\r\n                            52:16\r\n                            And this is the one thing that... I mean, they brought it on themselves. So, it is God's law that when they do this, they are destroyed.\r\n                            52:26\r\n                            Nowadays, where homosexuals are spread in the society, you cannot just destroy the city of Tucson because there are a thousand homosexuals in it.\r\n                            52:35\r\n                            But you can send a virus to pick them out.\r\n                            52:41\r\n                            And this is what's happening now. A man: What happens to the children who are (unintelligible)?\r\n                            52:47\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Their parents brought it on them. A man: What if you got it from blood transfusion?\r\n                            52:52\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Right. They brought it on themselves. Their family, Their family take the children out of God's protection.\r\n                            52:58\r\n                            This is what happens. It's actually a blessing for the children, after all. But if you... whatever disaster happens, it's because the parents removed their children out of God's protection.\r\n                            53:11\r\n                            A man: How could it be that the parents actually develop the fate of the child?\r\n                            53:16\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Ok. We discussed this before. And we said when... When the parents do not follow the commandments, God assigns to their homes, souls that deserve whatever is gonna happen.\r\n                            53:30\r\n                            The children are not so innocent as we think. Remember Adolf Hitler was a cute child.\r\n                            53:37\r\n                            A woman: Who? Dr. Khalifa: Hitler. He was a cute, innocent child.\r\n                            53:43\r\n                            But God knew in advance that he's gonna be a tyrant.\r\n                            53:49\r\n                            So was Gaddafi.\r\n                            53:57\r\n                            Do you understand, Babak? Do you understand the point?\r\n                            54:03\r\n                            Babak: I have a hard time understanding it. Dr. Khalifa: Okay, the babies who will be born next year, where are they now?\r\n                            54:09\r\n                            Remember, we existed before the earth came into creation. Okay, the children who will be born next year, where are they now?\r\n                            54:16\r\n                            Babak: Not here. Dr. Khalifa: Right. They're in some depository, waiting their turn to come into this world.\r\n                            54:22\r\n                            Now you agree that God knows which ones are good and which ones are bad, right? Okay, God told the people in the Bible that if you don't keep the commandments,\r\n                            54:32\r\n                            you will incur, you will remove yourselves from God's protection for four generations.\r\n                            54:38\r\n                            So, what is the mechanism? What is the mechanism here? It's that when a baby is born in a certain home next year, God will assign a certain soul to that home, right?\r\n                            54:50\r\n                            But God does that. He assigns the souls to the homes and the environments where they grow in.\r\n                            54:58\r\n                            So, God can pick out a good soul or a bad soul, depending on what the situation is.\r\n                            We are in an Era of belief, Believers protected from accidents and Diseases. Doubter debates.\r\n                            55:06\r\n                            So, the people who pass AIDS onto their babies, they brought it on themselves because they use drugs or...\r\n                            55:14\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: But AIDS is mainly a homosexual disease. There's no question about it. Babak: Rashad, I was talking about Babak: children who are, for some reason or another, need blood transfusions.\r\n                            55:21\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Right. Babak: And they get blood transfusions, not from their parents, Babak: not that their parents have AIDS or drugs or whatever. Dr. Khalifa: From the blood, yes. Even those.\r\n                            55:29\r\n                            Babak: But they get AIDS because of some other jerk, who had AIDS or whatever. Dr. Khalifa: Right. Right.\r\n                            55:35\r\n                            Babak: And I just think of... Dr. Khalifa: Okay, we are, we are in an era now where believing house will not need a blood transfusion, to start with.\r\n                            55:46\r\n                            Babak: We don't (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: We are in an era where when you believe in God and follow His commandments,\r\n                            55:52\r\n                            you will not need a blood transfusion to start with, neither you, nor your family.\r\n                            56:02\r\n                            Maybe difficult to fathom, but this is God's promise throughout the Quran.\r\n                            56:10\r\n                            Babak: I'm sorry I don't mean (unintelligible). But if you go outside in the street and there's an accident, you lose some blood and...\r\n                            56:20\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Well, that, I'm saying this will not happen, to start with.\r\n                            56:30\r\n                            God says He'll protect you from anything like that. If it has to happen, God will protect you, will give you clean blood.\r\n                            56:40\r\n                            But I'm saying that it will not happen, to start with.\r\n                            56:47\r\n                            Okay, let me... Because this is difficult to understand, and I'm not bragging or anything, but I thank God first. I wanna tell you,\r\n                            56:53\r\n                            I'm speaking from experience. And I mention this. It'll be boring to a lot of these people here, because they heard it before.\r\n                            57:00\r\n                            But when I was a child, I used to go swim in the canals in the countryside, the village.\r\n                            57:07\r\n                            And there's a disease in Egypt that if you swim in the canal, you have to catch that disease called Bilharzia. It's still epidemic in Egypt.\r\n                            57:15\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: And every year, they'll take the children and check them for Bilharzia, through a urine sample. A woman: They don't even check them.\r\n                            57:22\r\n                            A woman: Then I used to watch it for so many years, people who lived in the countryside where they would go swimming They'd never even check (unintelligible).\r\n                            57:28\r\n                            A woman: At the end of the summer, they lined them up, did a check against (unintelligible). They do Dr. Khalifa: Right. A woman: the same with Bilharzia. They never even bothered checking. Dr. Khalifa: Well, they asked them. Yes.\r\n                            57:35\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa Right. A woman: They just did it. They lined them all up and gave them a shot. Dr. Khalifa: These are the ones they knew they swam in the canal, right?\r\n                            57:41\r\n                            Well, I was living in a city. So, they checked all the children, at least in my time.\r\n                            57:47\r\n                            They took a urine sample and check them for Bilharzia. And every time, I come out negative.\r\n                            57:53\r\n                            And they'll ask me \"did you go to the village this summer?\" \"Yes.\" \"Did you swim in the canal?\" \"Yes.\" Okay, now they sent a nurse with me, to make sure that I'm giving them a urine sample, not a faucet,\r\n                            58:04\r\n                            not a sample from the faucet. They'll go with me, and they will take the sample, and it'll be negative. And I'll go home, and my father would ask me \"did they check you for Bilharzia?\" I say \"Yes.\"\r\n                            58:15\r\n                            He said \"what did they find?\" I said \"nothing.\" And my father shake his head. It's God's protection. So, I learned that from an early stage.\r\n                            58:22\r\n                            So, you can live in the virus, live in the germs, and God will protect you.\r\n                            58:28\r\n                            So, I guess God knew that I'd be passing this information on to you. And before I do anything, I thank God for His protection. Then, I'm talking to you from experience.\r\n                            58:38\r\n                            It will not happen. When you're a believer, it will not happen. You will not catch AIDS. You will not need transfusion. You will not have an accident.\r\n                            58:45\r\n                            You don't even get traffic tickets, depending how good you are. You will get these as pinches whenever you do something wrong.\r\n                            58:53\r\n                            But for as long as you're sincerely searching for God, God will give you time, will protect you, until you make a decision.\r\n                            59:03\r\n                            Your decision would be to remain in God's protection, or step out of God's protection.\r\n                            59:10\r\n                            So, it's your decision. God left it in our hands. Babak: What I'm saying is that everybody dies at some time.\r\n                            59:16\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: That's right. Babak: Every one of us is gonna die Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Babak: for one reason or another, accident, (unintelligible), whatever. Dr. Khalifa: That's right.\r\n                            59:23\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, but... Babak: And it's gonna happen. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: Well, death is not a disaster. Babak: ...disease that was an easier...\r\n                            59:29\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, Death is a fact of life for each one of us. Babak: The impression that I'm getting is that staying with God is gonna protect us from all evil and all harm. Dr. Khalifa: That's right. That's right.\r\n                            59:41\r\n                            Babak: And as long as you believe that harmful is gonna come to us... Babak: But at the end, maybe at the age of 90, or 500, or whatever, we're gonna die. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            59:50\r\n                            Babak: And we're gonna die of something. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. That's right. Babak: We're not going to stop... Dr. Khalifa: No, no, but there are different...\r\n                            \r\n                            24 Quran Study From Behrouz 1424 Sura 55 By Lori Alfatehe Sura 56 By Naghmeh\r\n                            \r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: أعوذ بِٱللَّهِ مِنَ ٱلشَّيْطَـٰنِ ٱلرَّجِيمِ We seek refuge in God from Satan.\r\n                            0:07\r\n                            Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\r\n                            0:12\r\n                            Tonight, we're starting at Sura 54, 55, excuse me.\r\n                            0:19\r\n                            And our teacher tonight will be Laurie, right?

Sometimes I say things that appear to be not very tactful.\r\n                            0:35\r\n                            For example, we have here a great team of cake-bringers or cake-makers.\r\n                            0:41\r\n                            And when I asked, then Rahima was... it was Rahima's turn, Laurie's turn, I said \"the best.\"\r\n                            0:48\r\n                            So, this... they're all, they're all great makers of cakes, bringers of cakes.\r\n                            0:53\r\n                            And this appears not to be tactful, but I have to explain to you that each believer is the best.\r\n                            1:00\r\n                            So, when I, when I say \"the best,\" I'm referring to every single one of them.\r\n                            1:06\r\n                            Because we're all...

And I knew that, IN SHAA ALLAH, over time, that God would explain it to me.\r\n                            5:53\r\n                            And one of the blessings of being in this mosque is having things explained to us.\r\n                            5:59\r\n                            And as Rashad said in the Khutba today, it's a mercy from God that He sends a messenger from among us to explain to us.\r\n                            6:08\r\n                            The knowledge is here in the Quran, and all of us have read the Quran. You know, I read it once a month, from front to back.\r\n                            6:15\r\n                            And every time there's something new. And we get what we need at the time we need it.\r\n                            6:22\r\n                            And we in this mosque are just developing so far. It's just amazing. You know, Rashad and Lisa and Hasan went to Canada, and there were the people believed they way we do.\r\n                            6:32\r\n                            They're still way behind us in the knowledge, because we're here every Friday night, learning and studying.\r\n                            6:39\r\n                            We have the input of all these believers here. And we have a messenger that is given the knowledge that is passed on to us.\r\n                            6:47\r\n                            And we're responsible for the information in the Quran. And, you know, the verse in the Quran that was admonishing the (unintelligible), saying that\r\n                            6:57\r\n                            they were believers when they weren't really. They were just submitters, and that's the first step. But only the believers can attain Paradise.\r\n                            7:05\r\n                            So, if we don't have absolute certainty, we can't ever grow and develop to our fullest extent.\r\n                            7:11\r\n                            And that's where the increased knowledge is that should bless me. And I read, you know, I've read this verse so many times, and the first time I read it,\r\n                            7:19\r\n                            you too, the humans and the jinns, you know, I just didn't understand what it meant. I didn't understand what the jinns were, what their role was, what they had to do with me or with us.\r\n                            7:30\r\n                            It was just a mystery. And I just, you know, like I said, I had to force myself not to question it, not to be hung up about it.\r\n                            7:37\r\n                            When we had that discussion about jinns in the Quranic studies, I just kept my mouth shut, you know, very different things.\r\n                            7:44\r\n                            But now, just in this last year, we found out what this is, and so this chapter has a totally different meaning.\r\n                            7:52\r\n                            And for the first time, I understand what it means. And we know now that the jinns are, you know, they have the same requirements.\r\n                            8:02\r\n                            There's other verses in the Quran that they have the same requirements that we do. Some of them believed in Jesus, and they believed in other things, and then they heard the Quran,\r\n                            8:10\r\n                            and they believed, and, you know, they have the same requirements that we do.\r\n                            8:16\r\n                            And they also have the same rewards that we do. You know, there are entities that we can't see. You know, we don't know. They can see us, but we can't see them.\r\n                            8:25\r\n                            And yet, the Heaven that's described here in later verses is for them, too. They have their own, but it's the same set-up as ours. It's exactly the same for them.\r\n                            8:35\r\n                            Like, you know, these creatures that are so important in this scripture that we don't know anything about.\r\n                            8:41\r\n                            And now we know that the jinns were those that, before creation, sided with Satan and\r\n                            8:48\r\n                            took a stand against God and believed that Satan could be a god besides God, that God could have partners, which is the ultimate blasphemy.\r\n                            8:57\r\n                            And they were banished, and they have a chance to redeem themselves as well.\r\n                            9:03\r\n                            And our job is to, you know, and I used to read about Satan and his troops\r\n                            9:08\r\n                            and generations of jinns and humans, that I didn't know, how do they, how do they come to be generations?\r\n                            9:13\r\n                            How do they multiply? How do they, you know, what do they do to reproduce themselves?\r\n                            9:19\r\n                            Now we know that a jinn is assigned to each one of us, and so their reproduction is,\r\n                            9:25\r\n                            it coincides with our reproduction, that each one of us is given a companion at\r\n                            9:31\r\n                            the time of our entry into this world, and we're in the same boat. We both sinned.\r\n                            9:37\r\n                            We both came to this earth with original sin. We both took a stand against God, the jinns more forcefully than we did, but we took the same stand\r\n                            9:47\r\n                            as not being for God, because there's only two ways. Either you're for or you're against, and we were wishy-washy, but basically we were against God.\r\n                            9:55\r\n                            We've both been given the chance to redeem ourselves. Thing is, the jinns took the definite stand. So, they're going to try to convert us to Satan's way of thinking and to the original sin that we committed.\r\n                            10:08\r\n                            So, we have to convert them. So from the time of birth, we're in this constant struggle with our jinn companion to convert them to righteousness\r\n                            10:18\r\n                            and to protect ourselves from falling into the path of the jinn. And It's a struggle. It's a struggle every day of our lives, and it just goes on and on.\r\n                            10:27\r\n                            And the blessing about knowing who your enemy is, is knowing what they are, what their goal is,\r\n                            10:34\r\n                            what their tactics are, so you can learn how to defend yourself. And that's what the Quran is, and that's where these blessings come from.\r\n                            10:42\r\n                            So, we know that. And to me, the greatest blessing of all is knowing that we do have original sin and we're bad.\r\n                            10:48\r\n                            You know, we were born bad, because we took the stand against God. So now that we know that, we know what we have to do.\r\n                            10:55\r\n                            We have to, just every day of our lives, try to redeem ourselves from that sin.\r\n                            11:03\r\n                            And the Quran is very specific about giving us the way to do it, and we know now,\r\n                            11:09\r\n                            we've heard it several times in Khutbas, that we have to ask ourselves every day \"who is my god this week?\"\r\n                            11:15\r\n                            Ok. Because that's our only goal in life, is to redeem ourselves. Nothing else has any importance whatsoever.\r\n                            11:22\r\n                            And we have to do certain things. We have to support ourselves. We have to take care of ourselves. But\r\n                            11:28\r\n                            with the goal in mind that this is to do righteousness, you know, we can't be a burden to society, we can't steal, so we have to work and support ourselves.\r\n                            11:36\r\n                            So, it's all in tune with the same thing, which is purifying ourselves, and growing and developing our souls.\r\n                            11:43\r\n                            So as soon as you take that stand, then the jinns are going to try to,\r\n                            11:48\r\n                            your companion and others are going to try and make you stray away from that path. And the greater the stand you take, the greater the enticements are going to be, and you just have to be prepared.\r\n                            12:00\r\n                            And I've talked to several people who've said that they've encountered the same thing I did when I made the stand, that I was going to really try and devote more of my thoughts\r\n                            12:09\r\n                            to God because I wasn't doing enough, and I knew it, that they just took over, and they didn't want me to, even the little that I was doing was in danger of not being done at all.\r\n                            12:19\r\n                            It's just a constant struggle. And so I know this now, and I know that I have to just be on the alert at all times for, for this. And we know that\r\n                            12:30\r\n                            most of it is sneaky whispering. And there's even a Sura where, you know, this is\r\n                            12:35\r\n                            devoted to this, that Satan whispers to us, I mean, little things that don't seem so bad.\r\n                            12:42\r\n                            You know, we've talked about this before. \"Oh, you can wait until the game is over before you pray\" or you know \"I'll pray later,\" and then something happens and you don't pray.\r\n                            12:50\r\n                            And that time can never be regained. Once you miss the Prayer, you can't make it up. That time is...\r\n                            12:55\r\n                            The inhabitants of Hell are the farthest from God on the Day of Judgment. Knowing that Heaven is close to God, they will leave Hell and sneak into the area closer to God,\r\n                            13:04\r\n                            but because they are not sufficiently prepared to come close to God, they will suffer terribly in the presence of God and will flee back to Hell and so on forever.\r\n                            13:13\r\n                            Here's this vicious circle that they're in. A man: It's just like the Jehovah's Witnesses now.\r\n                            13:20\r\n                            They don't believe in Hell, but they believe 144,000 go to Heaven and the remainder\r\n                            13:27\r\n                            of their chosen people or whatever go to Paradise. But they still deny Hell.\r\n                            13:34\r\n                            They say \"there's no burning Hell. There's no none of this. You just no longer exist,\"\r\n                            13:40\r\n                            which is a lie of... outright lying itself, because nothing that exists can be destroyed.\r\n                            13:49\r\n                            You know, like matter can't be created or destroyed, ever destroyed. It just recycles.\r\n                            13:56\r\n                            In the real world that we're in. No, in the other world, this is not the real world, but in the world we're in now.\r\n                            14:02\r\n                            So, they don't believe in Hell, because if you tell them anything contrary to anything pleasant after death,\r\n                            14:10\r\n                            they say \"well, we just don't exist anymore.\" \"Well, we never get punished for what we do wrong.\"\r\n                            14:18\r\n                            \"And that's our punishment, not existing.\" \"Well, we can get a reward. If we're real good, we get this reward.\"\r\n                            14:24\r\n                            \"But if we're real bad, we just don't exist anymore.\" \"Just have a reward and no punishment.\"\r\n                            14:30\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: They wish, they wish this. A man: That's what I'm saying. This, this is... A woman: Thank you. Dr. Khalifa: Quran... A man: This is what I thought about it. Dr. Khalifa: The Quran says 'they will wish that they...\"\r\n                            14:37\r\n                            A man: Yeah. \"This is the Hell they used to deny.\" Dr. Khalifa: Yes. A man: They deny Hell. Dr. Khalifa: Exactly.\r\n                            14:43\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: I just wanna add here something that we should all know.\r\n                            14:50\r\n                            I know Laurie knows that but she just didn't mention it yet. It has to do with the looks.\r\n                            14:56\r\n                            See, verse 40 says, (unintelligible), number 39.\r\n                            15:04\r\n                            Where's the... Well, not they ask...Oh, 39, yeah.\r\n                            15:10\r\n                            \"The humans and the jinn will not be asked about their sins.\" Nobody will need to ask anybody about anything, because the believers develop their souls,\r\n                            15:21\r\n                            and the disbelievers fail to develop their souls. And in Sura 17, we're told that the differences in the Hereafter are...\r\n                            15:30\r\n                            In this room, the differences in our sizes are within a few inches. But in the Hereafter, the difference will be like the difference between a mouse and the city of New York, city of Tucson, let's say.\r\n                            15:42\r\n                            So, when you see somebody the size of the city of Tucson, he or she has developed the soul sufficiently.\r\n                            15:50\r\n                            This is why they will be able to come closer to God. When you see somebody's the size of a mouse, you don't need to ask, you know \"what did you do wrong?\"\r\n                            15:59\r\n                            So, that is, this is why nobody will need to ask anybody about their sins.\r\n                            16:05\r\n                            It is so obvious. There'll be no question. Also, in Sura 17, we're told that everybody will be the judge for him or herself, to herself.\r\n                            16:15\r\n                            Because in that dimension, we will see what we really look like, how much we really developed or how much we lacked development.\r\n                            16:26\r\n                            So, boy, when they get you, they'll be recognized by their looks. They'll be undeveloped. They'll be shrunken, like being born without arms and legs.\r\n                            16:38\r\n                            Deformed. They will be born into the Hereafter, deformed, undeveloped, aborted.\r\n                            16:46\r\n                            But they'll be alive, very well, I mean, well, very alive, not well.\r\n                            16:57\r\n                            Also, God lets us understand, as Lori explained in verse 44, how they will try to sneak into Heaven, and they'll find it worse than Hell.\r\n                            17:08\r\n                            They will sneak into the Lower Heaven, and they will find it worse than Hell, because they cannot stand, come any closer to God.\r\n                            17:19\r\n                            See, God left it completely up to us, completely. This is why God does not inflict an atom's weight of injustice.\r\n                            17:26\r\n                            It's absolutely up to you. You can be as close to God as you want, in the High Heaven, or you can be as far from God as you want.\r\n                            17:36\r\n                            It's completely up to us. So, the conclusion is that God does not put a single person in Hell.\r\n                            17:44\r\n                            It is the people who insist or choose, and they insist on going to Hell.\r\n                            17:50\r\n                            This, the whole thing will be automatic in the Hereafter. This is why it is important to do, for example, the five Prayers a day.\r\n                            17:59\r\n                            You don't do the five Prayers every day, you won't talk. That's the minimum that you can do.\r\n                            18:06\r\n                            Because those are the meals for the real person.\r\n                            18:11\r\n                            Imagine if you don't feel... your body does not dry, and you don't feed your body for two months.\r\n                            18:17\r\n                            What will your body look like? There's no death in the Hereafter.\r\n                            18:24\r\n                            Just imagine not eating for two months. And the people out there in the street, they don't feed their soul for years and years and years.\r\n                            18:34\r\n                            And imagine what they look like. Can you imagine what they look like? Just look into our dimension here and think of bodies that didn't eat for years.\r\n                            18:44\r\n                            You see those skeletal pictures of the starving people in Central Africa, Ethiopia, Sudan.\r\n                            18:52\r\n                            What they look like, you can see their ribs. The shrunk skin and bones.\r\n                            18:59\r\n                            And this happens to the soul if the soul is not fed the five meals every day.\r\n                            19:07\r\n                            [55:41] The guilty will be recognized by their looks;...\r\n                            19:15\r\n                            You can tell who is starving in Africa and who is not. By looking at them.\r\n                            19:21\r\n                            And in the Hereafter, you will be able to know who is starving and who is not.\r\n                            19:27\r\n                            Except it will be by choice. So, now we go back to Lori and number 46, The Higher Heaven.\r\n                            19:35\r\n                            Lori: Yes. [55:46] For those who reverence the glory of their Lord, there will be two Paradises.\r\n                            19:43\r\n                            [55:47] Which of your Lord's marvels can you two deny? [55:48] With abundant vegetation. [55:49] Which of your Lord's marvels can you two deny?\r\n                            19:50\r\n                            [55:50] Two springs run freely therein. [55:51] Which of your Lord's marvels can you two deny?\r\n                            19:55\r\n                            [55:52] They will have two kinds of every fruit. [55:53] Which of your Lord's marvels can you two deny?\r\n                            20:01\r\n                            [55:54] They will relax on furnishings lined with silk while the fruits of the two gardens are brought near.\r\n                            20:06\r\n                            [55:55] Which of your Lord's marvels can you two deny? [55:56] They will have magnificent spouses therein, never before touched by any human or jinn.\r\n                            20:15\r\n                            [55:57] Which of your Lord's marvels can you two deny? [55:58] They will look like gems and coral.\r\n                            20:20\r\n                            [55:59] Which of your Lord's marvels can you two deny? [55:60] Is the reward of righteousness anything but the best blessing?\r\n                            20:26\r\n                            [55:61] Which of your Lord's marvels can you two deny? These verses are just so beautiful.\r\n                            20:33\r\n                            The Higher Heaven, and we know that the verses describing Heaven and Hell are allegorical because there's no way that we can conceive or understand what it really will be like\r\n                            20:43\r\n                            until God gives us these things that brings it into our own dimension.\r\n                            20:48\r\n                            But we know that there are stratifications. And for those, very clear here, [55:46] For those who reverence the glory of their Lord,...\r\n                            20:56\r\n                            who've done everything that they have been able to do, developed their souls, who have kept the commandments, who have not set up another god besides God, then God rewards\r\n                            21:07\r\n                            those with the best blessings. And He doesn't even have to do it.\r\n                            21:12\r\n                            But there's a verse in Quran that says that God is appreciative. And it's just, that's so incredible to me because He doesn't need us at all.\r\n                            21:20\r\n                            Why should He be appreciative of anything that we do? It's just that He is Most Gracious, Most Merciful.\r\n                            21:26\r\n                            And we can't comprehend. We can't comprehend that kind of mercy because we're bound by our own\r\n                            21:32\r\n                            selfishness and, you know, our own desire to succeed and our own concern with our own well-being.\r\n                            21:41\r\n                            We can't imagine that something could be so gracious and so merciful that it could just provide all these things for us.\r\n                            21:51\r\n                            I mean, it's just the ultimate of just leisure, not having to do anything and everything that you want, every kind of food that you want to eat, and you don't have to do anything.\r\n                            22:00\r\n                            It's just, you know, the springs, they're running freely and you don't have to worry about finding a spouse and going through all these changes.\r\n                            22:06\r\n                            And you know, they're just there and you don't have to do anything at all. It's just, it's just an incredible mercy.\r\n                            22:16\r\n                            And, you know, what did we have to do in this life to get there? I mean, it's like the most incredible, you know, if somebody offered you a deal and said\r\n                            22:24\r\n                            \"if you, you know, buy stock at, you know, 50 cents a share and in 10 years, it'll sell for a million dollars a share\"\r\n                            22:30\r\n                            and you think, you know, that's impossible. How could anything like that exist? But this is even greater.\r\n                            22:36\r\n                            All we had to do was say our five Prayers every day, not to have any other gods besides God, but just for our own benefit anyway.\r\n                            22:43\r\n                            God doesn't need us. You know, to do the religious duties that are so simple, to fast for one month,\r\n                            22:51\r\n                            which if we know is good for us, it lowers our blood pressure, it, you know, gives our kidneys a break.\r\n                            22:56\r\n                            We know that praying is good for us. You know, we know about lubricating the joints, and combating arthritis.\r\n                            23:04\r\n                            All of these things that are done for our benefit anyway, and just in exchange for doing that, we get this unbelievable,\r\n                            23:13\r\n                            you know, this Paradise that, you know, is beyond our wildest dreams, and we know that it's even greater than this.\r\n                            23:20\r\n                            Because this is just something that God gives us, which is to our limited ability to to perceive anything. What God has in store for us is so much greater.\r\n                            23:29\r\n                            In fact, we're told in the Quran that we can't even imagine what is in store for us as a reward for doing what we're supposed to do in the first place.\r\n                            23:38\r\n                            It's just incredible mercy. And, you know, we've talked about this before sometimes, well, you know.\r\n                            23:47\r\n                            The Lower Heaven isn't that bad either, when we read the next verses you'll see, but the picture here, I mean, there's not that great a differences that we know\r\n                            23:55\r\n                            that the Higher Heaven just means that we'll be closer to God. And that's the only understanding that we really need to have, is that we'll be closer to God.\r\n                            24:02\r\n                            And the further away from Him we are, the more miserable we'll be. So, even though we'll be in Paradise in the Lower Heaven, it won't be the same.\r\n                            24:13\r\n                            And in the next verses, the Lower Heaven, starting with 62.\r\n                            24:19\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Next, the next two verses, IN SHAA ALLAH, will tell us who goes to the Higher Heaven and who goes to Lower Heaven. Very specific.\r\n                            24:26\r\n                            And our teacher will be Naghemeh. Friday. Sura 56, Naghmeh. (unintelligible)\r\n                            24:38\r\n                            Before this... A woman: Yula asked that if you would pray for her son.\r\n                            24:45\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: It's Yula? A woman: He has this virus thing and really a bad cough and stuff. She said she had to take him right now.\r\n                            24:52\r\n                            (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Nothing bad will happen to her, IN SHAA ALLAH. We will recite Al-Fãtehah for Yula and her baby.\r\n                            24:59\r\n                            And we recite Al-Fãtehah for also, ask God to heal Lori, her voice.\r\n                            25:05\r\n                            And Parivash's daughter, Lamia, is having an operation of teeth next week on Friday.\r\n                            25:12\r\n                            God loves it when we pray to Him and ask Him to heal our friend and heal us.\r\n                            25:18\r\n                            And ask Him for the dearest wish. Also, we're gonna pray to God to bless the birthday folks, Soad, Hamid.\r\n                            25:30\r\n                            Hamid's birthday is tomorrow. And Soad's birthday is on 7th.\r\n                            25:35\r\n                            And the Erishen's are having an anniversary, the 19th anniversary, I think. No?\r\n                            25:41\r\n                            So, ask God to give them all the greatest year coming up and every year after that to be even better with God's blessings.\r\n                            25:49\r\n                            Al-Fãtehah Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem (1:1) Al hamdu Lillahi Rabbil ‘Alameen (1:2) Arrahman Arraheem (1:3) Maliki Yawm Eddeen (1:4) Eyyaka Na’abudu Wa Eyyaka Nasta’aeen (1:5) Ehdina Al-Serata Al-Mustaqeem (1:6) Serata Al-Lazeena An’amta ‘Alayhim Ghayri Al-Maghdoobi ‘Alayhim Wa Laddaalleen (1:7)\r\n                            26:09\r\n                            Also, we ask God to bless (unintelligible). Keep our friend forever. Audience: IN SHAA ALLAH\r\n                            26:28\r\n                            Naghmeh: From far ahead. Okay. We know...\r\n                            26:34\r\n                            Naghmeh: Really, should I repeat this? Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Naghmeh: Oh, Okay.\r\n                            26:40\r\n                            Okay, God says \"and those who are far ahead will be far ahead.\" And they will be closest to God.\r\n                            26:46\r\n                            And far ahead is, of course, the Highest Heaven. Then, and we know that far ahead doesn't mean how much money you have or what looks you have\r\n                            26:57\r\n                            or how much education you've got. But it means, what, the kind of intelligence that you have within where you see God and the truth and righteousness.\r\n                            27:08\r\n                            And, and we know that that's what puts us far ahead.\r\n                            27:15\r\n                            Not because, like I was saying earlier, that there are a lot of people who have all those things.\r\n                            27:22\r\n                            And they feel like they have a lot of power and they're in control. But they are very miserable. And they go through drugs and alcohol.\r\n                            27:30\r\n                            Most of the people who are out there that are into drugs and alcohol are doctors, people that we go to help us,\r\n                            27:37\r\n                            people who make all that money and who are in the high parts of society.\r\n                            27:43\r\n                            And people who think they are in control. Not that every doctor is bad or anything like that. But the power has a lot of times led to trouble.\r\n                            27:54\r\n                            Because people are not righteous enough. And they don't see. And they don't open their hearts. And they don't let go of that ego enough to understand that if you use your power with God's will,\r\n                            28:05\r\n                            then maybe you'll get somewhere. But other than that, you don't get anywhere.\r\n                            28:11\r\n                            Maybe here for a while. Like God says \"I'll let them enjoy this life for a while.\" But just for a while.\r\n                            28:17\r\n                            And, then we know that there are people who don't have those things. Yet their lives are very calm and very fulfilled.\r\n                            28:28\r\n                            And also, as I was saying earlier, is that the Quran has taught us that God is in full control of our money, of what we look like,\r\n                            28:35\r\n                            of what we, of how our lives are the thread that we walk into our lives.\r\n                            28:42\r\n                            And, then it seems pretty unfair that God would choose some people to have money and looks and put them in Heaven because of that.\r\n                            28:51\r\n                            But what makes more sense is that God has given every one of us, no matter what standards we have,\r\n                            28:57\r\n                            He has given us that freedom of choice, which makes us equal. And makes us the wise ones if we seek to choose the right path.\r\n                            29:09\r\n                            And, and that's where we'll be if we do the commandments in the Quran.\r\n                            29:15\r\n                            If the people of Jesus or Moses' time did everything that they brought down through the Bible or the Torah.\r\n                            29:23\r\n                            And, and if they did those things, then they will be in the Far Heaven.\r\n                            29:30\r\n                            And of course we know that this is the most complete. The prayers and the fasting and the charity, and belief in God alone and the Hereafter, and working righteousness.\r\n                            29:42\r\n                            And, and God willing, that will put us far ahead and make us sovereigns on earth,\r\n                            29:49\r\n                            no matter how much money or anything we have. And a lot of times I think that's really hard to understand.\r\n                            29:56\r\n                            And a lot of times we get bogged down. I know I do. Like when I see someone, you know, who has cute clothes on her, that's really pretty or something like that.\r\n                            30:05\r\n                            And, and you just have to step back and think and say \"that's not important. You have what God thought was good for you.\"\r\n                            30:17\r\n                            God says that you'll be [56:12] In the gardens of bliss.\r\n                            30:22\r\n                            [56:13] Multitudes from the early generations. Gardens of bliss is of course Heaven.\r\n                            30:30\r\n                            [56:13] Multitudes from the early generations. We have a footnote that says \"the early generations of Muslims were characterized by following the Quran, the whole Quran, and nothing but the Quran.\r\n                            30:40\r\n                            250 years after the Prophet, Hadith and Sunnah appeared, followed by the various schools of jurisprudence.\r\n                            30:48\r\n                            This marked the progressive deterioration of the Muslim nation.\"\r\n                            30:55\r\n                            Ok. This tells us \"the early generations,\" those are the people that had the big prophets. Those are the ones who had the messengers\r\n                            31:04\r\n                            that... well, we have messengers, too, but it just seems like there then it seemed like it was more in people's lives.\r\n                            31:12\r\n                            Now, it seems like technology has taken our lives so much that people don't think about God actually sending angels down or messengers down or miracles down.\r\n                            31:22\r\n                            But... So, those people who did follow the exact correct way were in the early generations and there are some people now.\r\n                            31:34\r\n                            But right now it seems like we just need more and more and more proof to make us be disciplined enough to understand.\r\n                            31:41\r\n                            And, and it seems like as time has gone by, people just want to interpret the way they think.\r\n                            31:47\r\n                            They don't like something the way it sounds. They have to change it to the way they want it. And that just makes a lot of conflict. And thank God that's why we have the Quran, which is so easy to understand.\r\n                            31:58\r\n                            And God says it's easy to memorize and understand. And, and it says in the footnote that \"250 years after the Prophet, these two books appeared.\"\r\n                            32:11\r\n                            And we know that these two books are the books that have all the traditions, the things that are totally contradictory to the Quran.\r\n                            32:17\r\n                            And these people are so blind that they don't even sit down to compare, to understand and see\r\n                            32:22\r\n                            that it is contradictory to what their Prophet that they idolize brought down.\r\n                            32:29\r\n                            Number 14. [56:14] But only a few from the later generations.\r\n                            32:34\r\n                            And this again tells us that, you know, just the later it gets, the harder it is for people to understand and to follow.\r\n                            32:42\r\n                            And they're so bogged down by the material things of this life that it's too hard for them to be religious and to do five daily Prayers, and, or fast for a month.\r\n                            32:54\r\n                            They couldn't see that at all. And, and so it seems like it is harder.\r\n                            32:59\r\n                            And I guess now we have all the Prayer and we have all the five commandments.\r\n                            33:07\r\n                            And it is. It's more, I don't know what you wanna call it, technical or something to get.\r\n                            33:14\r\n                            There's more work maybe to get to the Highest Heaven. And it's harder for those people who wanna work that hard and wanna put in the time to do their Prayers and their fasting and wake up before dawn.\r\n                            33:26\r\n                            And, and it is harder. And it just seems like those people have to go through more tests.\r\n                            33:35\r\n                            And, and it just seems fair in that sense.\r\n                            33:42\r\n                            God says, they will be [56:15] On sturdy furnishings. They will relax in rows facing each other.\r\n                            33:48\r\n                            [56:17] Serving them will be immortal servants. [56:17] Serving them will be immortal servants.\r\n                            33:53\r\n                            I know that a lot of these descriptions of the High Heaven or the Low Heaven, maybe even the Hell, they're all allegorical.\r\n                            34:03\r\n                            And God is, knows us so well that He explains all these things to us in a way that we could understand.\r\n                            34:12\r\n                            And so everybody loves to relax and they love to have stable things around them.\r\n                            34:19\r\n                            It seems like one day you're down and the next day you're up. But, God willing, in Heaven, everything will just be the same.\r\n                            34:25\r\n                            And, and it says, [56:17] Serving them will be immortal servants.\r\n                            34:32\r\n                            We'll have people serving us. Whereas later on we'll find out that in the Lower Heaven, they have to work for their water.\r\n                            34:40\r\n                            Naghmeh: They have to pour their own water, whereas we have servants, not we, but people who are in High Heaven.\r\n                            34:45\r\n                            A woman: (unintelligible) Naghmeh: I hit two. A woman: (unintelligible)\r\n                            34:53\r\n                            Naghmeh: Be in the High Heaven and they will serve us with cups, pitchers, and pure drinks.\r\n                            35:03\r\n                            So, it just shows that we're just gonna have to do less work. The more work we do now, the less work we'll do then.\r\n                            35:10\r\n                            If this, then that. [56:19] They are never diverted therefrom, nor deprived.\r\n                            35:18\r\n                            Which is great because we know that being here is human and being weak like humans.\r\n                            35:26\r\n                            We have a tendency to be diverted, but thank God we're pinched here and there.\r\n                            35:32\r\n                            And, and we learn. The ones that wanna learn, they learn. But we do get diverted. But there, God says \"you won't be diverted.\" And we won't be deprived.\r\n                            35:43\r\n                            I won't have to look at anyone (unintelligible).\r\n                            35:49\r\n                            Naghmeh: Wait, what? Dr. Khalifa: There's a question. A woman: (unintelligible) that when you said \"they won't be diverted or deprived,\" doesn't that mean an absence of anything?\r\n                            36:00\r\n                            Returning to the question of Satan being who diverted Adam and Eve and deprived them of their garden there.\r\n                            36:08\r\n                            So, there won't be any Satan in Heaven to divert you from your reward or deprive you from your credits.\r\n                            36:19\r\n                            Thank you so much. [56:20] With fruits of their choice.\r\n                            36:24\r\n                            So, whatever we want. [56:21] And meat of birds that they desire.\r\n                            36:30\r\n                            Anything we choose, anything we desire, [56:22] And Magnificent spouses.\r\n                            36:37\r\n                            We won't have spouses like we could have on earth, but I guess maybe it could mean that since people supposedly\r\n                            36:46\r\n                            love their spouses, then they can love up there just the same and more.\r\n                            36:51\r\n                            And, and they won't have to go through any kind of troubles.\r\n                            36:58\r\n                            It says that God describes them as precious pearls. And, which is, again, wonderful.\r\n                            37:08\r\n                            [56:24] This is the recompense of their works. which shows us that the more righteousness you are\r\n                            37:15\r\n                            and the more work towards goodness that you do, the better you will be treated in Heaven and the more you can have.\r\n                            37:24\r\n                            [56:25] They will hear no vain talk therein, nor sins.\r\n                            37:29\r\n                            [56:26] Only utterances of \"Peace, peace.\"\r\n                            37:36\r\n                            I know that in the Quran it says \"believers should not commit gross sins or they should\r\n                            37:44\r\n                            stay away from sin,\" yet God says that He understands that we do get diverted sometimes.\r\n                            37:53\r\n                            And it says that we shouldn't sit around tables where people are talking rumors.\r\n                            38:01\r\n                            And that if we sit with them, we are just as guilty and that we should get up and leave. And if we don't, we stay by mistake, then get up and leave when you remember and repent.\r\n                            38:12\r\n                            And that we shouldn't speak behind each other's backs and things like that.\r\n                            38:19\r\n                            But I think that a lot of times, especially when you're in groups of people, things like that,\r\n                            38:25\r\n                            you do fall into all that. You do fall into rumors. And it just seems like when people get into a group, they disagree on so many things.\r\n                            38:34\r\n                            It's like they say \"don't talk about religion. Don't talk about government. Don't talk about...\"\r\n                            38:39\r\n                            I don't know what else, but don't talk about rumors. Because it's the one thing that seems like a group of people just really understand together.\r\n                            38:48\r\n                            They really have fun with it. And they don't have fun if they disagree on religion.\r\n                            38:54\r\n                            People wanna kill each other if they talk about government or religion or discrimination or racism or anything like that.\r\n                            39:01\r\n                            But rumors, it seems like it's an easy topic and it will get people to be friendly with one another and it will pass time.\r\n                            39:07\r\n                            But up there, we won't have to stoop that low. And, and again, Satan won't be there to take us that way and make us forget.\r\n                            39:18\r\n                            There, there won't be no sin, there will be no sin, and there will be no vain talk, but\r\n                            39:23\r\n                            there will be just peace and happiness and, God willing, we'll be there.\r\n                            39:29\r\n                            Any questions? Dr. Khalifa: Verse 13, I have some very good news for you.\r\n                            39:37\r\n                            I'm not flattering you, but you are very, very special people. You've got to go to the Highest, Highest, Highest Heaven. I'm gonna explain to you why.\r\n                            39:49\r\n                            When Abraham started the religion of Islam, according to God's instructions, he and the people around him were worshipping God alone.\r\n                            40:00\r\n                            And as time went by, Satan sneakily and gradually added idol worship until the time of Muhammad came, some centuries later.\r\n                            40:12\r\n                            By the time Muhammad came, they were worshipping lots of idols,\r\n                            40:19\r\n                            Allaat, Manaat, Al-‘Uzzah, and all that. They were in the Kaaba that Abraham built.\r\n                            40:25\r\n                            And you've read how many verses in Quran that say \"Abraham was never an idol worshipper.\" Yet, there is the Kaaba that he built that was full of idols.\r\n                            40:34\r\n                            And then God renewed the message, sent the Quran to Muhammad. And sent Muhammad to tell the people \"the idols are bad. Worship God alone. Worship God alone.\" So, what happened?\r\n                            40:45\r\n                            And Muhammad and his company were persecuted severely. They threw on them all kinds of dirt and thorns.\r\n                            40:55\r\n                            Then, they banished them when they grew. There were about 10 or 15 people for about 3 years.\r\n                            41:03\r\n                            Then, they grew to about maybe 25 or 30 people. Then, they thought they were getting too strong, so they banished them out of Mecca, boycotted them.\r\n                            41:13\r\n                            Now, and those people were abused. So, those have to have a special place in Heaven.\r\n                            41:22\r\n                            They went against the current. They were worshipping God alone in an ocean of idolatry.\r\n                            41:29\r\n                            You can easily see that they were very special people. They will be in the highest place in the High Heaven.\r\n                            41:36\r\n                            Because even within the High Heaven and the Low Heaven will be ranks.\r\n                            41:41\r\n                            Okay, now, 20 years ago, you see how it says here,\r\n                            41:47\r\n                            [56:14] Few from the later generations. Now, these are later generations after Muhammad. 1400 years after Muhammad.\r\n                            41:55\r\n                            There is not a single mosque in the Muslim world that was worshipping God alone, that was, that is upholding the commandment \"the mosque belongs to God, you should not mention other names with God.\"\r\n                            42:09\r\n                            And then God renewed the message right now.\r\n                            42:15\r\n                            And the message went loud and clear, ringing throughout the whole world. \"Worship God alone.\" Say \"La Elaha Ella Allah.\"\r\n                            42:21\r\n                            NOT \"La Elaha Ella Allah, Muhammad Rasulallah.\" And \"devote yourselves to God alone. Uphold the commandments of the Quran.\"\r\n                            42:30\r\n                            \"Purify your worship. Your Prayer is wrong. Your fasting is wrong. Your zakat is wrong.\"\r\n                            42:35\r\n                            These are, these are all blessings from God that He sent to our generation.\r\n                            42:40\r\n                            And again, we are subject to the same persecution.\r\n                            42:46\r\n                            The same ridicule, lucky us.\r\n                            42:52\r\n                            Yours truly cannot go into any country in the Middle East. I'll be shot within 24 hours.\r\n                            42:58\r\n                            It symbolizes this. And if you go to the Middle East, you better disown me. I'm asking you to do that.\r\n                            43:05\r\n                            I mean, God says you even disown God, if you are under those circumstances. As long as your heart is filled with faith.\r\n                            43:12\r\n                            If you don't wanna get in trouble, you better tell them \"I don't know Rashad Khalifa.\" But this is...\r\n                            43:20\r\n                            You are very, very special people. You've gone through the middle of ridiculing, and mocking.\r\n                            43:29\r\n                            Today, Tasneem calls me from New York, and she was talking to some relatives of hers in Chicago, who are very active in the so-called Islamic Center.\r\n                            43:38\r\n                            And she told them \"I'm devoting myself to God alone. I only say \"La Elaha Ella Allah.\"\"\r\n                            43:43\r\n                            And guess what they said? They said \"Tasneem went to the dogs.\"\r\n                            43:48\r\n                            She's worshiping God alone. And this is ridicule, right? They ridiculed her.\r\n                            43:55\r\n                            You know \"you're saying La Elaha Ella Allah? You're saying, worship God alone? You mean God alone? Is that all you have, God?\"\r\n                            44:02\r\n                            I mean, do you see the logic? They're ridiculing her. Mahmoud was working the other night.\r\n                            44:09\r\n                            And some so-called Muslims walked in the store. And they saw the label that says \"Muhammad.\" Mahmoud on the label.\r\n                            44:15\r\n                            They said \"are you a Muslim?\" He said \"yes.\" They said \"how come we don't see you at the mosque?\"\r\n                            44:21\r\n                            He said \"how come I don't see you at the mosque?\"\r\n                            44:28\r\n                            So, they said \"oh, you mean you go to that mosque?\" That's the mosque that worships God alone, right?\r\n                            44:34\r\n                            Now, now, Noah, if you remember in the Quran, Noah said, because Noah was building the ark with the\r\n                            44:42\r\n                            flat float, whatever you call it, water raft.\r\n                            44:48\r\n                            And they were laughing at him. And he told them, he said \"you're laughing at me, but I'm really laughing at you.\" And this was Mahmoud actually was doing in the store.\r\n                            44:56\r\n                            Because they said \"oh, we never, we never believe in mathematics.\" A woman: Oh, God. Dr. Khalifa: Now, this is (unintelligible).\r\n                            45:03\r\n                            Now on that day, they probably had an exam in calculus, right? In university.\r\n                            45:09\r\n                            And they had to follow the formulas and the equations, and otherwise they (unintelligible).\r\n                            45:17\r\n                            So, they believe in mathematics. But if it comes to God and the Quran and worshiping God alone, they don't believe in mathematics.\r\n                            45:24\r\n                            So, they were looking at Mahmoud, you know, ridiculing him. And of course, he knows \"fool souls.\"\r\n                            45:30\r\n                            Just like Noah, he was ridiculing them. Just like... I mean, he was laughing at them, just like they were laughing at him.\r\n                            45:37\r\n                            But this makes Mahmoud a very special person. This, this is what it means,\r\n                            45:44\r\n                            [56:13] Multitudes from the early generations. We are the first generation of renewing the message.\r\n                            45:51\r\n                            And we see it very clearly. Every one of us is in the light, and we can see it.\r\n                            45:57\r\n                            Just go in any mosque in the world and say \"La Elaha Ella Allah.\" They will beat you up.\r\n                            46:04\r\n                            You are saying \"worship God alone.\" So, you can see what happens after centuries from the first generation.\r\n                            46:13\r\n                            Abraham was the first generation. And those people, I mean, they threw Abraham in the fire, right?\r\n                            46:24\r\n                            In those days, there was no America for Abraham to run to. They threw him in the fire. So, what did God do?\r\n                            46:32\r\n                            He turned the fire into a cool and safe place. Because God, God says \"do not think that I will abandon my messengers.\"\r\n                            46:41\r\n                            God creates exits for them. So, the exit for Abraham was a cool and safe fire.\r\n                            46:47\r\n                            And the people who were with him, they were persecuted. They have to be special people. Because the easiest thing is to go along with the masses, with the crowds.\r\n                            46:58\r\n                            You think this shook Mahmoud? Not one hair.\r\n                            47:03\r\n                            And this is why he's very special. I'm just using Mahmoud as an example. Muhtesem went to a grocery store to buy some Middle Eastern stuff.\r\n                            47:11\r\n                            And he met some Arabs there.\r\n                            47:17\r\n                            They're just totally ignorant. They know nothing. But he says \"yes, we go to Masjid Tucson. We worship God alone.\"\r\n                            47:25\r\n                            And they almost beat him up. If he wasn't big enough and strong enough, and a Turk, they would have beaten him up.\r\n                            47:35\r\n                            So, why do you have to take all this abuse and all this ridicule? Do you think it shook him up?\r\n                            47:41\r\n                            Did it affect his faith? If anything, it strengthened his faith.\r\n                            47:46\r\n                            Because he knows that those people are wrong. He knows they're ignorant. He knows they're not worshipping God alone. He knows they lost their Prayer. Probably, never Pray.\r\n                            47:55\r\n                            Those people, do you think they Pray? Muhtesem: Well, I asked them \"how many Suras are in the Quran?\"\r\n                            48:03\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: What? They don't know? Dr. Khalifa: You don't know? Muhtesem: (unintelligible)\r\n                            48:10\r\n                            They would say \"you're going to Hell.\" I said \"(unintelligible) (unintelligible). He was Palestinian.\r\n                            48:18\r\n                            Muhtesem: \"You're going to Hell.\" Dr. Khalifa: And he doesn't know how many Suras are in the Quran. Muhtesem: (unintelligible) on the Day of Judgement (unintelligible)\r\n                            48:30\r\n                            Muhtesem: Yet he was there (unintelligible)\r\n                            48:37\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: God is telling you \"I'm with you.\" Muhtesem: (unintelligible) Muhtesem: He's miserable. Just because I worship (unintelligible). I worship God alone. Dr. Khalifa: Exactly.\r\n                            48:45\r\n                            Muhtesem: (unintelligible)\r\n                            48:57\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: That's the abuse and ridicule that all of you went through, all of you, every single one of you.\r\n                            49:02\r\n                            Muhtesem: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: The Bashar couple, the Bashars, they ridiculed them so many times.\r\n                            49:11\r\n                            \"You mean you go to that mosque.\" And the answer is \"show me a place where they worship God alone, and I'll go.\"\r\n                            49:19\r\n                            \"We'll go to that place.\" I will go to that place. Any place where they worship God alone, we'll go.\r\n                            49:26\r\n                            God is the One... God is the One who created you. God is the One who provides for you.\r\n                            49:32\r\n                            God is the One who controls your health, your welfare.\r\n                            49:37\r\n                            God is the One who controls your happiness. God is the only One who controls your success.\r\n                            49:44\r\n                            Muhammad is dead. The saints are dead. Jesus is dead. Powerless. Even when they were alive. They had absolutely no power.\r\n                            49:55\r\n                            So, I mean they just... Because you're going through... This is a first generation. We are.\r\n                            50:03\r\n                            We are so lucky. We are a first generation, just like Abraham's generation, Muhammad's generation.\r\n                            50:12\r\n                            Muhammad's generation went through the ridicule, the abuse, and they had to leave their city, Mecca, and go to Medina.\r\n                            50:20\r\n                            The persecution they went through. Because of this, God reserves a special place for them.\r\n                            50:25\r\n                            God is reserving a special place for us. I'm saying it by God's grace.\r\n                            50:31\r\n                            So, I have this very good news for you. Because you are... you fit here in verse 13.\r\n                            50:37\r\n                            [56:13] Multitudes from the early generations.* In 50 years, I assure you, in 50 years, there'll be millions of people worshipping God alone, and upholding the Quran alone,\r\n                            50:47\r\n                            and Praying the correct way. Millions. In just 50 years.\r\n                            50:52\r\n                            But they will be following the crowd. They cannot be like you.\r\n                            50:58\r\n                            They will be protected by their numbers. Right at this location, right here, there'll be thousands, on this block, in this mosque.\r\n                            51:08\r\n                            And there'll be powerful... the people jumping on the wagons. But they don't deserve the same position, or the same credit as you.\r\n                            51:21\r\n                            So, this is, this is what it means. [56:13] Multitudes from the early generations.* [56:14] But only a few from the last generations.\r\n                            51:28\r\n                            Because these are the far ahead, in Arabic, (56:10) ٱلسَّـٰبِقُونَ ٱلسَّـٰبِقُونَ These will be the closest to God. They're very special.\r\n                            51:37\r\n                            That's you. And you start collecting benefits now.\r\n                            51:44\r\n                            And we've seen it. We have a history already. We have a track record in this mosque, 10 years of a track record, a perfect track record, in this life.\r\n                            51:56\r\n                            It's guaranteed by God. We may have a pinch here and there, but it's because we make mistakes.\r\n                            52:05\r\n                            The tests are brief for you. But if you stray off the path, you know you're gonna get a pinch.\r\n                            52:12\r\n                            And you get the pinch and say \"thank you God.\" And come back to the path. You are very special people.\r\n                            52:22\r\n                            You deserve a lot of congratulations. God says in Sura 35 that the angels have wings, 2, 3, and 4.\r\n                            52:32\r\n                            2, 3, and 4, because the angels closest to God will be the most powerful, the highest in rank.\r\n                            52:41\r\n                            They have more wings. This is figuratively speaking.\r\n                            52:46\r\n                            And these (56:10) ٱلسَّـٰبِقُونَ ٱلسَّـٰبِقُونَ these far ahead people, like yourselves, will be there.\r\n                            52:54\r\n                            I mean, all those are angels, but still, they have ranks. And 50 years from now, the thousands of people who will be in this location, IN SHAA ALLAH,\r\n                            53:04\r\n                            they will go to the High Heaven, because they worship God alone, and they will Pray the correct way. And they'll go to the High Heaven, but they cannot attain your rank.\r\n                            53:12\r\n                            Because you're the ones who are taking the abuse. The people who take the abuse and the ridicule have a very special position in the Bible and in the Quran.\r\n                            53:22\r\n                            I had a little thing, they hang in there for a while, that says \"Congratulations to those who are persecuted.\"\r\n                            53:29\r\n                            For the prophets also have been persecuted. Remember that verse? They hang it there.\r\n                            53:35\r\n                            And this is God telling you \"Congratulations.\"\r\n                            53:41\r\n                            So, we are very, very lucky. And I'm stressing, I keep stressing this, because I cannot stress it enough.\r\n                            53:51\r\n                            Just so you can thank God, so you can be appreciative, so you know who you are.\r\n                            53:57\r\n                            Satan will always put doubts in your mind, always will tell you \"you're nobody.\" He hates your guts, okay?\r\n                            54:06\r\n                            Because he's gonna be deep, deep in Hell. You hear that, Iman? You were asking about Satan in the Hereafter. He will not be in Heaven, No.\r\n                            54:14\r\n                            He will not even come close. He and his troops will be way deep down in the lowest pit of Hell.\r\n                            54:24\r\n                            And he'll be beating them, and they'll be beating him. They're gonna spend eternity doing that.\r\n                            54:32\r\n                            So, he will try to tell you \"you're a nobody.\" But you speak, you speak back to him. Tell him \"I believe God.\"\r\n                            54:40\r\n                            And I believe that I am in this group. [56:13] Multitudes from the early generations.* Because this is the first generation.\r\n                            54:49\r\n                            I mean, I couldn't believe it myself. For a long time, I said \"it couldn't be just us here worshipping God alone. There must be millions in the world.\"\r\n                            54:58\r\n                            But I discovered that I'm naive, that the human being is really bad.\r\n                            55:04\r\n                            I was talking to my nephew, Sharif, in Egypt. And he said \"I'm the only one in Egypt.\"\r\n                            55:11\r\n                            He really is a believer. And you can tell the, you can tell the people who believe because they are in the light. They understand.\r\n                            55:20\r\n                            And he's the only one that I know in Egypt, that's really a believer.\r\n                            55:26\r\n                            IN SHAA ALLAH, he will come to the conference. He's only, he's only 20.\r\n                            55:35\r\n                            He was born two weeks before Beth. And he's the only believer in all of Egypt.\r\n                            55:45\r\n                            I mean, I was really naive. I mean I said \"there must be millions in Egypt who worship God alone.\"\r\n                            55:50\r\n                            Nope. Wrong. So, this is why I'm speaking so strongly.\r\n                            55:55\r\n                            I'm telling you \"you're very special.\" And when Satan tells you \"you're not,\" you tell him to shut up.\r\n                            56:03\r\n                            You're very special. That is the verse that talks about you.\r\n                            56:10\r\n                            Congratulations. Dr. Sabahi: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Dr. Sabahi: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            56:25\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: And this time, and this time, right now. It refers to Muhammad's time, Ibrahim's time, and this time, our time.\r\n                            56:32\r\n                            We are a first generation. Right now. Because we are the fortunate generation that is renewing God's message, restoring it, cleaning out all the junk and innovations.\r\n                            56:47\r\n                            When you go back to Iran for a visit, you'll be... which town you will be in?\r\n                            56:53\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Tehran? Dr. Sabahi: Tehran. Dr. Khalifa: I think you'll be the only one in Tehran who's praying the correct way, you and (unintelligible), the kids.\r\n                            57:04\r\n                            You'll be the only... and they laugh at you. When you tell them \"and in TASHAHUD I just say the name of God alone,\r\n                            57:09\r\n                            they say \"you mean, you don't mention Muhammad or Ahlul-Bayt or Ali?\"\r\n                            57:14\r\n                            \"No.\" See, this is what we cleaned out, cleaned out all the creatures. We just mention the Creator.\r\n                            57:22\r\n                            And this is restoring the religion. Soو you are a first generation. Does this make you special or not? When you're the only one in Tehran who's Praying the correct way. Tehran is how many millions? Five?\r\n                            57:33\r\n                            You can see the details but this circle here, you start on this side.\r\n                            57:39\r\n                            You put down the first, start with the first verse of Quran. And write the number of every verse in Quran. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\r\n                            57:47\r\n                            The first Sura is 7 verses. Then, put 7, the number of verses in the Sura. And then do the same with every Sura all the way to the end of Quran, only in the upper half.\r\n                            57:57\r\n                            And then... Ok. Let me do it the other way around. Start with the number of verses in the Sura, 7.\r\n                            58:05\r\n                            Then, the number of each verse. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. And then you will link with the other system where you put the verses first and then the number later.\r\n                            58:16\r\n                            Ok. You will end up with a number that is in a circle that is 25,400 approximately digits, numbers.\r\n                            58:26\r\n                            This number is one mile long. And it is divisible by 19 and it has all the numbers in the Quran with the two systems.\r\n                            58:35\r\n                            One system where you put the number of verses at the end of the list of verses. Another system, you put the total number of verses at the beginning.\r\n                            58:43\r\n                            And in between the two systems, you have the number of the verses in the whole Quran. It's gonna be in the circle.\r\n                            58:50\r\n                            This eventually is going to convert the whole world because they will know that this book is not human made.\r\n                            58:57\r\n                            I mean the miracles are becoming so strong now that they will be irresistible.\r\n                            59:06\r\n                            So, we may be a very special... you're still a very special group, generation because you've been here even before this miracle was half this strong.\r\n                            59:18\r\n                            It is growing now. And 50 years from now, it's gonna be very common knowledge.\r\n                            59:25\r\n                            People will accept it easier because there'll be more people talking about it.\r\n                            59:31\r\n                            These people told Mahmoud \"we don't believe in mathematics.\" They didn't even look at it.\r\n                            59:37\r\n                            But as they jump in the wagon, they will look at it and they will see it and they will know.\r\n                            59:43\r\n                            They will just believe. They will know that this is God's message to the world.\r\n                            59:48\r\n                            So, the later generations for us may be different from the others. Dr. Khalifa: There are only 300 years left.\r\n                            59:55\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: As if God is saying that (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            1:00:03\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: This has been the system. You see, Christianity was corrupted 300 years after Jesus.\r\n                            1:00:10\r\n                            I mean, totally corrupted. They had the Nicene Conferences and they invented the Trinity and everything, 300 years after Jesus.\r\n                            1:00:18\r\n                            With Muhammad, it was 300 years that the Hadith became recorded and Islam was wiped out, totally corrupted 300 years after Muhammad.\r\n                            1:00:26\r\n                            Now with our generation, when it is 300 years, it's gonna be the end of the world.\r\n                            1:00:32\r\n                            And this is documented here in the Quran. So, we have a special situation here.\r\n                            1:00:42\r\n                            Also, we have a verse in Quran in 41:53 that says, [41:53] We will show them our signs in the horizons, and within themselves, until they realize that this is the truth.\r\n                            1:00:53\r\n                            So, this is a prophecy that God gave us. And this is what's happening now. And it will take 300 years for the world to realize,\r\n                            1:01:02\r\n                            probably every single person on earth will realize that this is God's message to the world. And I suspect the world will end with only believers on earth.\r\n                            1:01:10\r\n                            That's when Satan will throw up his hands and say \"I give up. I have no constituents anymore.\"\r\n                            1:01:16\r\n                            And that will be the end, end of the test. The miracle is very powerful.\r\n                            1:01:24\r\n                            And this is the very reason why you are very special people because you believed from the very beginning.\r\n                            1:01:32\r\n                            Some of you, even without looking at the miracle, you agreed to worship God alone and uphold the Quran alone.\r\n                            1:01:39\r\n                            That's a very special situation. Dr. Khalifa: I stole the show from Naghmeh. Naghmeh: Right.\r\n                            1:01:46\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: I thought it was very important. I wanted you to know who you are.\r\n                            1:01:56\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:02:10\r\n                            A man: Does it mean that there is also stratification within this... Dr Khalifa: Yes, within each (unintelligible), yes.\r\n                            1:02:16\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible) sorry. Dr. Khalifa: But you can call this Hell. And there'll be (unintelligible) there in the deepest... The hypocrites will be in the deepest pit of Hell.\r\n                            1:02:27\r\n                            Hypocrites are people who think they are believers. They say they're believers. They believe they are believers. But they are not.\r\n                            1:02:35\r\n                            Those are the hypocrites. But the whole place is Hell. This is what...\r\n                            1:02:42\r\n                            And God says \"those who barely miss Hell and make it into the lowest layer of the Purgatory\"\r\n                            1:02:48\r\n                            God calls this \"a fantastic triumph.\" Because if you miss this, this thing called Hell, within which there are different layers.\r\n                            1:03:01\r\n                            The same with the Lower Heaven and the same with the High Heaven. Because the people in the Purgatory, they cannot go much higher, but they are fantastically happy.\r\n                            1:03:10\r\n                            They are in Heaven. And within Heaven, like I said, there will be a line beyond which you cannot go.\r\n                            1:03:19\r\n                            These are natural borders. Your growth and development will decide that.\r\n                            1:03:28\r\n                            You know, every time you get abused and ridiculed, you grow immensely.\r\n                            1:03:34\r\n                            That's why Mahmoud came out smiling out of that episode.\r\n                            1:03:40\r\n                            So that Muhtesem... Gatut comes across those ones in a while.\r\n                            1:03:46\r\n                            A woman: I have one right in law school. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. A woman: He's not going to law school, but he works in a library. One time he went like this. It was like almost he hit me.\r\n                            1:03:55\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible) A woman: He was...and he... Dr. Khalifa: Does he worship God alone, right?\r\n                            1:04:00\r\n                            A woman: And he was like, he was like \"Dr. Khalifa says that it's OK for you to repent. Muslims don't have the right to repent.\"\r\n                            1:04:07\r\n                            A woman: I was like \"Excuse me?!\" That's exactly what he said. He said \"God doesn't tell us we have the right to repent. And he tells us that you can repent a hundred times.\"\r\n                            1:04:17\r\n                            A woman: And I'm like \"of course, you can. Without repenting, we'll all go to Hell. Are you kidding?\" Dr. Khalifa: But that's in the Quran.\r\n                            1:04:22\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: I guess he never read the Quran. A woman: Oh, so many other things. And he's like \"you need a Muslim husband who will teach you how it is.\"\r\n                            1:04:31\r\n                            And I said \"I'll teach him how it is.\" So, yes, I beat him, too.\r\n                            1:04:37\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: That's what he needs. A woman: I said \"I'll teach him.\"\r\n                            1:04:42\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: That's our love. A woman: Yeah. Dr. Khalifa: Let me tell you the kind of ridicule and the kind of stupidity they have. I have it obtained here.\r\n                            1:04:52\r\n                            This fellow came from Denver, Colorado.\r\n                            1:04:59\r\n                            And he wants to talk to me. So, I said 'if you have any place for us to talk, we'll talk to you.\"\r\n                            1:05:05\r\n                            And I said.... anyway, the conversation ended by me challenging him to say \"La Elaha Ella Allah.\"\r\n                            1:05:12\r\n                            I'm really convinced they cannot do it. I mean, I really know this now. Ihsan was listening.\r\n                            1:05:17\r\n                            I told him \"you are forbidden by God from saying La Elaha Ella Allah.\"\r\n                            1:05:23\r\n                            He said \"are you crazy or something? Of course, I can say La Elaha Ella Allah.\" I said \"go ahead. Say it.\" I said \"say it.\" Remember?\r\n                            1:05:32\r\n                            And he will say \"La Elaha Ella Allah, Muhammad Rasulallah.\" I said \"see? You cannot say it. Can you?\"\r\n                            1:05:38\r\n                            He said \"of course, I can say it.\" I said \"go ahead. Say it.\" He said \"La Elaha Ella Allah, Muhammad Rasulallah.\"\r\n                            1:05:45\r\n                            I said \"see? You just proved to me that you cannot say La Elaha Ella Allah, can you? Because you are forbidden by God.\"\r\n                            1:05:51\r\n                            I mean, here I'm challenging this guy to say \"La Elaha Ella Allah,\" and he cannot say it. I have it all recorded from the thing.\r\n                            1:05:58\r\n                            Now, so, this is, this is a fellow I kept challenging, and again, I guess he got so mad, so half hour later,\r\n                            Dr. Rashad Khalifa receives a death threat. Within Hell there are ranks.\r\n                            1:06:10\r\n                            he called and he said \"I'm gonna bring the gun and kill you tonight.\" Yeah, I have it. I have it on tape.\r\n                            1:06:17\r\n                            So, now he's so stupid because he talks at the machine, we're recording it, along with his phone number and everything.\r\n                            1:06:26\r\n                            So, of course, we called the police. The police went and paid him a visit. But that's how, that's how stupid, how angry he gets.\r\n                            1:06:35\r\n                            Would you threaten somebody and record it on the machine?\r\n                            1:06:42\r\n                            His address was divisible by 19. But this is the kind of abuse, the kind of ridiculing that every time you go through this, you grow immensely. This is a very special treat to you.\r\n                            1:07:00\r\n                            If Naghmeh and Apamea did not have the courage, they would have quit long time ago.\r\n                            1:07:06\r\n                            I mean, from cousins to brothers to uncles, relatives, aunts, everywhere, friends.\r\n                            1:07:14\r\n                            They're ridiculing them. Look at them, steady, persevering.\r\n                            1:07:19\r\n                            (unintelligible) God takes the believers out of darkness into the light.\r\n                            1:07:24\r\n                            And how can you go back to darkness after you've lived in the light?\r\n                            1:07:35\r\n                            They cannot say \"La Elaha Ella Allah.\" (unintelligible). I know they are forbidden by God from saying it.\r\n                            1:07:42\r\n                            They are hypnotized by Satan or whatever the (unintelligible) is.\r\n                            1:07:48\r\n                            So, within the High Heaven, there are ranks. And within the Lower Heaven, there are ranks. And within Hell, there are ranks.\r\n                            1:07:55\r\n                            But these are the general divisions. As we saw in Sura 55, there are big differences between the High Heaven and the Lower Heaven.\r\n                            1:08:06\r\n                            But what we have seen are the general characteristics.\r\n                            1:08:16\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Congratulations. Dr. Sabahi: Can I ask a question? Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Dr. Sabahi: Is it (unintelligible) Quran that (unintelligible)? Dr. Khalifa: No.\r\n                            1:08:31\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, there will be, there will be more believers than ever now. By the way, some people that were kind of suspicious of my population.\r\n                            1:08:42\r\n                            And God never let me down. (unintelligible) Magazine, the last issue, had an article of the population.\r\n                            1:08:50\r\n                            They had a population curve there. It is in full agreement with my history.\r\n                            1:08:56\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: So, this is good. A woman: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Yeah. A woman: ...the growing generations including us with a bar?\r\n                            1:09:02\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Right. Dr. Khalifa: Because I showed that the people from now to the end of the world will be 15 times as many as the people from the beginning of Adam until now.\r\n                            1:09:12\r\n                            In other words, the vast majority of the human race are getting the message that our generation is beginning right now.\r\n                            1:09:19\r\n                            Or starting a message of worshipping God alone, upholding God's Word alone.\r\n                            1:09:24\r\n                            And this is the message that God wills for the vast majority of the human race.\r\n                            1:09:31\r\n                            70 billion people. See, until now we had 6 billion people.\r\n                            1:09:37\r\n                            From now to the end of the world, it is projected that we'll have 70 billion people.\r\n                            1:09:43\r\n                            But to answer Dr. Sabahi's question, the verse in the Quran says,\r\n                            1:09:48\r\n                            it doesn't say that everyone will be a believer, but it says \"I will show them My signs until they realize that this is the truth.\"\r\n                            1:09:56\r\n                            So, the prophecy is that God will spread His signs until everybody becomes a...\r\n                            1:10:03\r\n                            Not everybody, maybe everybody, but at least almost everybody will be a believer.\r\n                            1:10:10\r\n                            The miracles that we are seeing now, and they have all discovered the people connected with us.\r\n                            1:10:18\r\n                            The people who believe exactly as we do. And this is an exclusive, specifically a very strong sign.\r\n                            1:10:28\r\n                            And these miracles will be known by everyone. I'm telling you, in 50 years, there'll be millions, millions of people worshipping God alone and following the Quran alone.\r\n                            1:10:39\r\n                            Millions, in just 50 years, maybe less. Naghmeh: You know, what I was gonna say also, it's not only that we're gonna have more people\r\n                            1:10:47\r\n                            later who are gonna be seeing these miracles, but also there's another mercy I think from God in that\r\n                            1:10:53\r\n                            the old generation, there might not have been as many people as we're gonna have. But the life span then was, what, 35 or 40 years old. Women died in labor.\r\n                            1:11:04\r\n                            Naghmeh: There was the wars between Spain and, you know, the Europe and stuff. They were all young people. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            1:11:11\r\n                            Naghmeh: And so, you know, it seems like there was mercy there too, because they were all young and they died young. Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:11:17\r\n                            Naghmeh: Yeah. Right. Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:11:23\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Go ahead. Naghmeh: Okay, The Lower Heaven, 27.\r\n                            1:11:28\r\n                            [56:27] As for the inhabitants of the right side, they will be on the right side.\r\n                            1:11:34\r\n                            [56:28] They will enjoy lush orchards. [56:29] And fresh fruits. [56:30] And abundant shade. [56:31] And water to be poured.\r\n                            1:11:42\r\n                            [56:32] And many fruits. [56:33] Always in season. [56:34] And exalted furnishings. [56:35] We raise spouses for them. [56:36] Never previously touched. [56:37] Magnificent companions.\r\n                            1:11:52\r\n                            [56:38] Exclusively reserved for inhabitants of the right side. [56:39] Multitudes from the early generation. [56:40] And multitudes from the later generations.\r\n                            1:12:01\r\n                            Okay, number 27. This we see, the difference between this is from the far ahead to the right side.\r\n                            1:12:09\r\n                            And, you know, we've said it over and over again. Well, we know that the people who died before the age of 40\r\n                            1:12:18\r\n                            go in the Lower Heaven. And we know that the basic rules in the Quran to make the Lower Heaven is\r\n                            1:12:27\r\n                            to believe in God alone, to work righteousness, and to believe in the Hereafter. And those people will make it.\r\n                            1:12:33\r\n                            Then, then the right side just sounds so right, sounds so right.\r\n                            1:12:39\r\n                            Because first of all, like we know from, you know, the (unintelligible) that we always play is that God knows everything.\r\n                            1:12:45\r\n                            God knows the one who is really, really, really mean and bad and He will keep them until they're old.\r\n                            1:12:51\r\n                            But, but the ones who died before they are 40, obviously God knew that there was something right about them.\r\n                            1:12:58\r\n                            And just because, you know, their life was shorter than ours doesn't mean that it was any kind of bad, you know, thing from God's position.\r\n                            1:13:08\r\n                            But that maybe they were gonna prove a test for their family or whatever. But that the thing is that God knew they were on the right side.\r\n                            1:13:17\r\n                            And God tells us that the age of 40, you know, before the age of 40, they go to the Lower Heaven.\r\n                            1:13:22\r\n                            And, and it just makes sense that those are the people who died before that age. And plus, it's a test for their families.\r\n                            1:13:33\r\n                            But they are still, they're so protected. And so if you're on the right side here, you'll be on the right side there.\r\n                            1:13:41\r\n                            You won't be up at the top of the people who really tried hard. But you'll be there. And also I think a lot of times, you know, there are a lot of people who believe in God alone.\r\n                            1:13:51\r\n                            They believe in the Hereafter and they work righteousness. But it's just way too difficult to ask them to do anything else.\r\n                            1:13:59\r\n                            They might give to charity but, you know, on their own, a lot of people maybe do. But they probably don't even give money or anything, but old clothes type of things.\r\n                            1:14:09\r\n                            Naghmeh: But... Dr. Khalifa: God says He will reward them for their righteousness. Naghmeh: Right. You know, so it's some kind of charity. But they will not do the Prayer. It's too hard.\r\n                            1:14:18\r\n                            They say \"I can see myself doing one but five\", you know. And... And, and I'm like \"you're not doing any, you know, God doesn't need you to be doing this. It's for us.\"\r\n                            1:14:29\r\n                            You know, \"and you're not doing any favors for God for doing your prayer, but that it's a favor for us.\" And over all that, to think 25 minutes maybe out of your whole day, 24 hours, is really nothing.\r\n                            1:14:42\r\n                            And I hate to think of it as that but sometimes it just brings you down just saying that. But anyways...\r\n                            1:14:48\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible). A woman: I know.\r\n                            1:14:56\r\n                            Naghmeh: So, but I guess they're just right on... Dr. Khalifa: The Prayers, the Prayers are meals. When they say \"one Prayer maybe but not five\", this means, it's like saying, I just have breakfast.\r\n                            1:15:05\r\n                            Naghmeh: Yeah. Dr. Khalifa: Nothing else. Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible) But whatever righteous thing, work you do, you get rewards.\r\n                            1:15:16\r\n                            Again, we're gonna hear some allegorical things. There's gonna be some difference from the Highest Heaven.\r\n                            1:15:23\r\n                            There's gonna be shade and there's gonna be fresh fruits, but it doesn't say what they choose.\r\n                            1:15:30\r\n                            It doesn't say what they desire but there will be fresh fruits. And it says,\r\n                            1:15:36\r\n                            [56:31] And water to be poured. which means poured, I guess, from them because it doesn't say that they will have servants.\r\n                            1:15:41\r\n                            So, that means a little bit more work for those people. But they will be taken care of, basically.\r\n                            1:15:50\r\n                            I don't understand why it says here [56:35] We raise spouses for them. But in the other one, it says that they will automatically have, like, you know, magnificent spouses.\r\n                            1:15:59\r\n                            What's the difference between raising spouses for the right...? Dr. Khalifa: It's like, if you can go to the market and get a meal of corn, or you can put a seed in there and watch it grow until it's a tree of corn.\r\n                            1:16:10\r\n                            Naghmeh: Oh, that is great. I mean, it makes sense. Dr. Khalifa: Yes, that's a little bit different.\r\n                            1:16:16\r\n                            Naghmeh: That is great.\r\n                            1:16:29\r\n                            Naghmeh: And here we have multitudes from the early generations and multitudes from the later generations,\r\n                            1:16:35\r\n                            which goes along with what you were just saying, that in the later generations that come after the people who went through all the\r\n                            1:16:42\r\n                            trouble and the hassles, the people laughing at them and mocking them, there will be a lot of people who will be, God willing, following the scripture.\r\n                            1:16:52\r\n                            The footnote says \"because all the humans who die as children will be assigned to the Lower Heaven, the proportion from each generation is about the same.\r\n                            1:16:59\r\n                            That also makes sense, of course. So, we just know that, you know, multitudes from the early generations, that could be the people, you know, who,\r\n                            1:17:12\r\n                            Naghmeh: the younger, yeah, Dr. Khalifa: Children, Children. Naghmeh: the ones who died before the age of 40, because in the earlier generations, they died at a young age, and then the multitudes from the later generations could be the ones, all the people who follow us.\r\n                            1:17:24\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: But because this happens all the time, no matter what is happening, it could be Abraham's generation, or Muhammad's generation, all the generations, but still, children die in accidents,\r\n                            1:17:35\r\n                            people die before 40. So, this is happening continuously. A man: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: No.\r\n                            1:17:47\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Yeah.\r\n                            1:17:53\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: So, 40 is there.\r\n                            1:17:58\r\n                            Naghmeh: Yeah. Any questions about the Lower Heaven?\r\n                            Age of 41.\r\n                            1:18:03\r\n                            How? 41.\r\n                            1:18:09\r\n                            Hell goes right after 41! Wait, what?\r\n                            1:18:15\r\n                            It's 41! Naghmeh: My God. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Oh, my God. Naghmeh: Yeah. Dr. Khalifa: This (unintelligible) Huh?\r\n                            1:18:21\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Yep. Dr. Khalifa: 41 means Hell, if you don't make that decision.\r\n                            1:18:27\r\n                            A woman: Oh, wait a minute. Dr. Khalifa: If you don't make that decision by then... A woman: Ok.\r\n                            1:18:34\r\n                            A woman: That's the year (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: 41 is higher.\r\n                            1:18:40\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible) Naghmeh: Subhan Allah.\r\n                            1:18:45\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Remember the circle? See, this circle here means every verse in the Quran is numbered according to a system, God's system.\r\n                            1:19:00\r\n                            Naghmeh: As for the...should I go on? [56:41] As for the inhabitants of the left, they will be on the left.\r\n                            1:19:08\r\n                            If you don't work righteousness, you don't believe in God alone, you don't do the commandments,\r\n                            1:19:13\r\n                            you don't listen to your inner intuition to believe in God and work righteousness, then\r\n                            1:19:19\r\n                            you will be exactly where you deserve to be, which is Hell, which is... Dr. Khalifa: Lisa wants to stop you. Naghmeh: Oh, I'm sorry.\r\n                            1:19:24\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Go ahead. Lisa: If you go to the Sura that we looked at last week, it talks about Hell.\r\n                            1:19:35\r\n                            Naghmeh: It's 41! A man: Oh, my God. A woman: Oh, my God.\r\n                            1:19:42\r\n                            Naghmeh: Mã Shã Allãh\r\n                            1:19:49\r\n                            A woman: What page? Dr. Khalifa: 378. 378.\r\n                            1:19:57\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: There is no doubt. There'll be no doubt, folks, about the age of 40.\r\n                            1:20:04\r\n                            Age 40 is the cut-off point. Naghmeh: We're like the people on Noah's Ark.\r\n                            1:20:12\r\n                            Naghmeh: Or people walking through the sea, you know, with Moses. God, we're just like those people. Dr. Khalifa: Exactly.\r\n                            1:20:21\r\n                            Naghmeh: [56:42] In ill winds and retribution. [56:43] In shade that actually burns.\r\n                            1:20:27\r\n                            [56:44] Never cool, never tolerable. [56:45] They used to be spoiled. [56:46] They insisted on the great blasphemy.\r\n                            1:20:33\r\n                            [56:47] They used to say, \"After we die and become dust and bones, do we get resurrected?\r\n                            1:20:39\r\n                            [56:48] \"Even our early ancestors.\" [56:49] Say, \"The early generations and the late generations.\r\n                            1:20:45\r\n                            [56:50] \"Will be gathered together on a predetermined day. [56:51] \"Then you, O strayers and disbelievers. [56:52] \"Will eat from the trees of bitterness.\r\n                            1:20:54\r\n                            [56:53] \"You will fill your bellies therefrom.

[56:55] \"You will ingest drinks of humiliation.\"\r\n                            1:21:04\r\n                            [56:56] Such is their position on the Day of Judgment. [56:57] We created you, if you could only believe!\r\n                            1:21:10\r\n                            [56:58] Do you see the semen you produce? [56:59] Is it you who create it, or are we the creators?\r\n                            1:21:18\r\n                            [56:60] We have designed death for you. And nothing can prevent us— [56:61] from substituting others in your place, and establishing what you do not know.\r\n                            1:21:30\r\n                            I stop there. Again, if you don't work righteousness and believe in God alone and everything, then\r\n                            1:21:38\r\n                            you will be in Hell where you deserve to be. Again, allegorically, I believe, it very graphically explains to us what it's going to be like in Hell.\r\n                            1:21:52\r\n                            And I don't have to be there to already feel it. And... And it says that ill winds and retribution.\r\n                            1:22:03\r\n                            And they will be constantly burning. And they can just never get out.\r\n                            1:22:09\r\n                            And... And just it seems sad in a way, but again, you know, God has just put Hell, created Hell, and we put ourselves in there.\r\n                            1:22:27\r\n                            And God knows and in every scripture it's described what Hell is gonna be like.\r\n                            1:22:33\r\n                            And people just don't understand. They don't believe in it. [56:45] They used to be spoiled. [56:46] They insisted on the great blasphemy.\r\n                            1:22:42\r\n                            [56:47] They used to say, \"After we die and become dust and bones, do we get resurrected?\r\n                            1:22:49\r\n                            [56:45] They used to be spoiled. That seems like such a, you know, good word again, spoiled.\r\n                            1:22:54\r\n                            Besides, it seems like the people who just wanna be in control and the people who just think that\r\n                            1:23:03\r\n                            material things make them happy and if they're down, well, you know, \"it's okay honey, let's go shopping\" or whatever.\r\n                            1:23:10\r\n                            Actually... Wait, wait, wait.\r\n                            1:23:17\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Believers can do that, too. (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:23:30\r\n                            Naghmeh: I take that back. I said \"thank you, God.\"\r\n                            1:23:35\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Right. Naghmeh: How can I say thank you?\r\n                            1:23:42\r\n                            Well, anyway, those spoiled people who think that they're just in charge and that they can make things better or worse on their own\r\n                            1:23:52\r\n                            and they don't need anyone else or anything else and, you know, as long as they have everything that they like in this life, then it's fine and...\r\n                            1:24:03\r\n                            and they don't have to question the Hereafter. They don't feel that there's anything holding them back for them to be seeking God.\r\n                            1:24:09\r\n                            It's like a lot of people, you know, when they go through a bad time, it's when they go towards God and it says it in the Quran. It says.\r\n                            1:24:17\r\n                            \"Whenever hard times come to them, they remember Me. When things get better, they forget about Me.\"\r\n                            1:24:23\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: It's called Bad Weather Friends. A woman: Bad Weather Friends. Dr. Khalifa: In the new translation, Bad weather friends.\r\n                            1:24:30\r\n                            Cause when they are about to drown or the plane is in trouble, they remember God. (unintelligible) this verse is saying.\r\n                            1:24:38\r\n                            As soon as they land on shore, they forget God.\r\n                            1:24:43\r\n                            Naghmeh: And they just insist on the great blasphemy no matter how many times maybe hardship falls upon them, how many times they get stuck in the\r\n                            1:24:50\r\n                            black sea or whatever, they still might go back. Well, the people who are in Hell, they do, but some people learn from their mistakes.\r\n                            1:24:59\r\n                            And they question \"after we die and become dust and bones, do we get resurrected?\"\r\n                            1:25:06\r\n                            So many people have troubles with that. About... they'll believe in maybe reincarnation.\r\n                            1:25:13\r\n                            I went to this comedy club the other day. I have never gone to one before. And so many times they talked about Shirley MacLaine saying that she's gonna be...\r\n                            1:25:22\r\n                            Naghmeh: She was in reincarnation. A woman: She'll be back. Naghmeh: She'll be back. A woman: (unintelligible) Naghmeh: She was, she was an elephant or something.\r\n                            1:25:30\r\n                            In the Hereafter, but she will not believe that she could... her soul could be raised. But she'll believe in reincarnation. And so many of these people brought up the same thing, you know, up on the stage.\r\n                            1:25:39\r\n                            And... Anyway, so they question that, too.\r\n                            1:25:45\r\n                            And God says \"if you don't believe in the Hereafter,\" one of the pillars of the Lower Heavens, then that's it.\r\n                            1:25:54\r\n                            [56:48] \"Even our early ancestors.\" There's no difference. We know that God has sent us prophets and messengers throughout the community and throughout our lives.\r\n                            1:26:04\r\n                            So, whether it's early ancestors or later ancestors, we're all gonna be resurrected together no matter what.\r\n                            1:26:11\r\n                            [56:49] Say, \"The early generations and the late generations. like what I said.\r\n                            1:26:18\r\n                            [56:50] \"Will be gathered together on a predetermined day. We know that, well, we know that the Day of Resurrection, the Day of Judgment will come in about 300 years.\r\n                            1:26:28\r\n                            And that... And that everybody will be waiting in line and they will be judged by their souls and their videotapes.\r\n                            1:26:37\r\n                            And we're all gonna be together. We're all gonna see what the other person is and there's nothing you can hide.\r\n                            1:26:43\r\n                            And like it says in the Quran, it says, even, you know, the ones who are friends will be hating each other on that day, you know when,\r\n                            1:26:52\r\n                            if they didn't work righteousness. So, all will be together.\r\n                            1:26:58\r\n                            [56:51] \"Then you, O strayers and disbelievers. [56:52] \"Will eat from the trees of bitterness.

[56:57] We created you, if you could only believe!\r\n                            1:27:30\r\n                            [56:58] Do you see the semen you produce? [56:59] Is it you who create it, or are we the creators?\r\n                            1:27:38\r\n                            Again, you know, this is another reminder again for us to take a look at. Gosh, you know, how were we created?\r\n                            1:27:47\r\n                            How did all this come about, you know? And it's just incredible how the whole system of, I guess, getting pregnant or whatever works.\r\n                            1:28:00\r\n                            And it's just really amazing. And if somebody doesn't question where that came from, they think that it came from generations of monkeys,\r\n                            1:28:08\r\n                            then I think there's something wrong. Dr. Khalifa: Did anybody see Nova? (unintelligible)\r\n                            1:28:14\r\n                            They were talking about this, had a program on this. Dr. Khalifa: how the semens come and move to their position.\r\n                            1:28:20\r\n                            Naghmeh: Only one out of... Dr. Khalifa: If anybody sees that who does not believe in God...\r\n                            1:28:27\r\n                            I can't imagine anybody watching this and not believing in God. That was a few days ago.\r\n                            1:28:34\r\n                            Naghmeh: Just how perfect every single woman's body work. I mean, it's just amazing.\r\n                            1:28:40\r\n                            And God questions it, you know, is it you who created it? Is it the prophets who came down? Is it the messengers who created it?\r\n                            \r\n                            25 Quran Study From Behrouz 1525 Sura 58 By Robert\r\n                            \r\n                            Robert: [58:3] ...shall expiate by freeing a slave before they resume intercourse. This is to admonish you. God is Cognizant of everything you do.\r\n                            0:09\r\n                            [58:4] If you cannot find a slave to free, then you shall fast two consecutive months before resuming intercourse. And those unable to fast shall feed sixty poor persons. This is for you to believe in God and His messenger. These are God's laws, and the rejecters have deserved painful retribution.\r\n                            0:27\r\n                            [58:5] Those who oppose God and His messenger are doomed like those before them who were doomed. We have revealed clear revelations, and the disbelievers therein have deserved painful retribution.\r\n                            0:38\r\n                            [58:6] The day will come when God resurrects them, then informs them of everything they had done. God has recorded it while they forgot. God witnesses all things.\r\n                            0:50\r\n                            [58:7] Do you not realize that God knows everything in the heavens and the earth? No three people can meet in secrecy without Him being the fourth, nor five without Him being the sixth, nor less than this, nor more, without Him being there. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform them of everything they did. God is fully aware of all things.\r\n                            1:12\r\n                            [58:8] Those who are prohibited from conspiracy, then go back to it, conspiring sinfully, maliciously, and in defiance of the messenger. When they come to you, they greet you not with God's greetings, and say to themselves, let us see if God will punish us for what we say. Their only destiny is Hell wherein they burn; what a miserable destiny.\r\n                            1:33\r\n                            [58:9] O you who believe, if you have to confer secretly, you shall not confer to commit sin, transgression, and disobedience to the messenger. You may confer only to work righteousness and piety. Beware of God, for you will be gathered before Him.\r\n                            1:47\r\n                            All right, we'll stop there. All right, verse one.\r\n                            1:52\r\n                            [58:1] God has heard the woman who debated with you about her husband and complained to God... [58:2] Those among you who estranged their wives as if they were their mothers are doing wrong...\r\n                            2:03\r\n                            Obviously, this is in the Quran for a reason. God...\r\n                            2:08\r\n                            As the footnote says \"a common statement by Arabian husbands who wanted to punish their wives was\r\n                            2:14\r\n                            \"you are forbidden to me in intercourse as my mother.\" Ok. That obviously, it obviously applied to that point in time in history where this was a common thing, to where it needed to be said.\r\n                            2:28\r\n                            But as we know, the Quran is for every day, and it applies at all times. So, what these verses are saying, we should obviously take to heart.\r\n                            2:39\r\n                            Ok.\r\n                            2:44\r\n                            [58:3] Those who estranged their wives in this manner, then reconcile, shall expiate by freeing a slave before they resume intercourse. This is to admonish you.\r\n                            2:54\r\n                            There again, obviously, we don't have slaves or things like this today.\r\n                            3:02\r\n                            But the point is well taken about the relationship that should exist between a husband and a wife and how\r\n                            3:12\r\n                            how regardless of the circumstances, how a person should treat his wife.\r\n                            3:23\r\n                            Okay, [58:4] If you cannot find a slave, then you shall fast two consecutive months before resuming intercourse.\r\n                            3:29\r\n                            Like this is just straightforwardness here, telling you or telling people this applies to,\r\n                            3:39\r\n                            what they need to do to receive reconciliation.\r\n                            3:45\r\n                            Ok. [58:5] Those who oppose God and His Messenger are doomed like those before them who were doomed. We have revealed clear revelations, and the disbelievers therein have deserved painful retribution.\r\n                            3:56\r\n                            This verse is just tremendous. When God says \"We have revealed clear revelations, and the disbelievers therein have deserved painful retribution.\"\r\n                            4:05\r\n                            When He says \"clear\", He means \"clear.\" The Quran come... the Quran is straightforward, and it says what...you know, what it says is what it means to you.\r\n                            4:15\r\n                            When you read it, you don't have to... I mean, it's so fully detailed that you don't have to look to any other outside sources\r\n                            4:24\r\n                            to find the meaning of it. It's right there. The Quran is complete. You don't need the Hadith, the Sunnah, the Bible.\r\n                            4:31\r\n                            Plus, the Quran confirms these previous scriptures. So, there's no need for them, excluding the Hadith, Sunnah.\r\n                            4:41\r\n                            So, when you see people that are rejecting this on the basis of one thing or another,\r\n                            4:49\r\n                            it's... they truly deserve, or they will receive, their due... their due... (unintelligible).\r\n                            5:02\r\n                            [58:6] The day will come when God resurrects them, then informs them of everything they have done. God has recorded it while they forgot. God witnesses all things.\r\n                            5:12\r\n                            This verse is... tells us, while a lot of verses have, and it's been well discussed in here\r\n                            5:18\r\n                            in terms of God recording everything, and God knows everything that we do. Nothing goes... nothing goes without...\r\n                            5:26\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Martha, Martha (unintelligible)\r\n                            5:38\r\n                            Robert: Okay. Nothing goes... nothing happens or in anything, in any place on this earth, without God knowing about it.\r\n                            5:46\r\n                            From everything... from the ant moving, to the actions of the challenger. Anything. Anything.\r\n                            5:52\r\n                            God... when you say God has recorded it, that means God knows your actions before you've even committed them.\r\n                            5:59\r\n                            God... Everything has been recorded before they even took place. But when we say this, lots of times we know in the Quran that God controls everything\r\n                            6:08\r\n                            here in this mosque, and God controls everything on the earth.\r\n                            6:14\r\n                            But in the same sense, you have a... when you decide that you want to be a believer,\r\n                            6:26\r\n                            you're making a covenant with God, and you have to hold up your end of the deal.\r\n                            6:31\r\n                            You have... you have an obligation in which you're saying \"yes, I will Pray five times a day.\r\n                            6:39\r\n                            Yes, I will give to charity.\" You have obligations that you have to do. You have to hold up the commandments. You have to be a righteous person.\r\n                            6:46\r\n                            Okay, that doesn't... so that means just because God controls everything and God knows what's gonna happen, and everything is pre-recorded, doesn't mean you can sit back and relax\r\n                            6:55\r\n                            Like, like a sticker on the... a bumper sticker on the car outside, I was looking at it a\r\n                            7:03\r\n                            couple days ago, and it says \"relax, God's in charge.\" Okay, that means... to me, I took that and I thought \"relax, God's in charge. What does that mean? Relax, sit back, God's in charge?\"\r\n                            7:13\r\n                            No, it means \"relax your emotions. Don't worry about anything, because God's in control.\"\r\n                            7:19\r\n                            But that doesn't mean that your end of the deal... you don't have to hold up your end of the deal. You understand what I'm saying?\r\n                            7:25\r\n                            It's not like you can just \"okay, well, we'll just relax, and I'll sleep from 8 p.m. to 8 p.m. the next day.\r\n                            7:36\r\n                            So, we have an obligation to God, and that extends into everything we do.\r\n                            7:42\r\n                            God wants us to be the best we can, and put forth the maximum effort in everything we do.\r\n                            7:47\r\n                            I discussed this with Mr. Khalifa about, well, why should we wanna achieve in everyday life?\r\n                            7:56\r\n                            Why should we want to be a success? Why should a person want to go to college and get an education, or make money, or all these things?\r\n                            8:05\r\n                            Because in retrospect, they're not really important. All that's important in this life is our relationship to God.\r\n                            8:11\r\n                            And realizing that, that's when these other things can become important, because a wealthy\r\n                            8:19\r\n                            believer, he said, can do more good than a poor believer. They can help more people. They can do more things.\r\n                            8:26\r\n                            Not that one is better than the other, but just the capability of giving more to charity\r\n                            8:33\r\n                            and things like this is greater if you have more wealth, naturally. And with that in mind, also, God wants us to do our best in everything we do.\r\n                            8:43\r\n                            And when it comes to our jobs, it's a matter of thinking about God in your job.\r\n                            8:50\r\n                            That becomes our goal, to be conscious of God at all times. So you're going to work, but you're realizing that you're completely conscious of God at\r\n                            9:01\r\n                            all times within your work. That's what we're talking about, of not idolizing anything else.\r\n                            9:06\r\n                            When you set these goals, set these goals with the ultimate plan of being righteous\r\n                            9:11\r\n                            in mind in your relationship with God. I kind of got stuck on that verse, because that's the one I understood.\r\n                            9:17\r\n                            I can elaborate on that one a little bit longer.\r\n                            9:23\r\n                            Ok. [58:7] Do you not realize that God knows everything in the heavens and the earth? No three people can meet in secrecy without Him being the fourth, nor five.\r\n                            9:30\r\n                            This is, goes along the same lines. God knows everything. [58:7] ...God is completely Cognizant of all things.\r\n                            9:37\r\n                            You can't meet in private. You can't, you know, it just... God knows everything, and everything is recorded.\r\n                            9:47\r\n                            Ok. [58:8] Those who are prohibited from conspiracy then go back to conspiring sinfully, maliciously, and in defiance of the messenger.\r\n                            9:55\r\n                            I didn't really understand this. Those who are prohibited from conspiracy, who would that be?\r\n                            Secret conspiracy i.e. boycotting congregational gatherings. Estranging wives due to being like mothers. Abolishment of Slavery.\r\n                            10:02\r\n                            Prohibited from conspiracy. Conspiracy in terms of...\r\n                            10:07\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: As meeting in secrect. Dr. Khalifa: People in their privacy, they may plot things that may not be in harmony with the society or the group.\r\n                            10:18\r\n                            Robert: Ok. So, people... so in a society where you are prohibited from meeting in secret or...\r\n                            10:23\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, let's just say three or four of us are sitting somewhere and they say \"let us not go to the picnic of\r\n                            10:30\r\n                            the group tomorrow, and let us go and invite some others to the mountain, or to the desert.\r\n                            10:38\r\n                            So, they're conspiring to break up the group. So, this is the kind of conspiracy.\r\n                            10:44\r\n                            Robert: Okay. [58:8] ...Conspiring sinfully, maliciously, and in defiance of the messenger... Then \"let us see if God will punish us for what we say.\"\r\n                            10:55\r\n                            Robert: Here again, you see people testing God, and obviously, I mean, that's not the case here. Dr. Khalifa: Actually, we had these things happen here\r\n                            11:05\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: in the past, and those people are not here anymore. A man: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: They're just troublemakers, and they want to do silly things to just create disharmony in the group.\r\n                            11:20\r\n                            And time proved that they were not really believers.\r\n                            11:25\r\n                            Robert: Ok. [58:9] O you who believe, if you have to confer secretly, you shall not confer to commit sin, transgression, and disobedience to the messenger. You may confer only to work righteousness and piety. Beware of God, for you will be gathered before Him.\r\n                            11:41\r\n                            That is just always keeping in mind that the Day of Resurrection is coming. Regardless of where you meet, or the circumstances with which you meet, remember always to be righteous and pious.\r\n                            11:52\r\n                            Okay, any questions or comments?\r\n                            11:57\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible)\r\n                            12:03\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa:. Yes.\r\n                            12:10\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Okay, I think the custom of exchanging the wife as if she is the mother, is kind of unfair to the wife,\r\n                            12:19\r\n                            especially in a society where there is polygamy. One wife is left hanging. She is not free to marry somebody else.\r\n                            12:27\r\n                            She's not practicing getting her rights as a wife.\r\n                            12:33\r\n                            So, God is ending that cruel practice. And in verse 3, we see the Quran's solution to the slave problem, where slavery was practiced.\r\n                            12:49\r\n                            It was practiced in this country until 200 years ago. 200 or what? 100 years ago?\r\n                            12:57\r\n                            And the Quran's method is the most effective and the best method economically, because\r\n                            13:03\r\n                            if you free half a million slaves all at once, there will be problems. They will not be able to handle it.\r\n                            13:10\r\n                            So, the Quran made it for expiation, or atonement for sins.\r\n                            13:17\r\n                            So, to be (unintelligible). And Robert said we don't have any slaves, so it works.\r\n                            13:29\r\n                            The guy who was sitting in a bus or something who was just clapping like this. Somebody asked \"what are you clapping for?\"\r\n                            13:39\r\n                            So, he said \"this keeps the elephants away.\" The guy said \"But there are no elephants... The nearest elephant is 3,000 miles from here.\"\r\n                            13:49\r\n                            He said \"see, it works.\" So, there are no slaves now, because this method works.\r\n                            13:59\r\n                            And in the next verse, the verse says \"if you cannot find a slave\", so, if you don't have a slave of your own,\r\n                            14:05\r\n                            you can always go and actually find a slave anywhere.\r\n                            14:10\r\n                            And free, pay... pay for his freedom. Douglas?\r\n                            14:16\r\n                            Douglas: Do these verses also refer to situations where the wife disclaims her husband?\r\n                            14:22\r\n                            It seems that a wife should not treat her husband as if he's her father.\r\n                            14:27\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: I don't think that custom exists, although it is sometimes a de facto. It's called headache instead of...\r\n                            14:39\r\n                            It's a de facto statement. Douglas: I've heard that before.\r\n                            14:45\r\n                            (unintelligible)\r\n                            14:52\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Sometimes, I see (unintelligible)\r\n                            15:05\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: It is a very common problem. Sometimes, it's the husband's problem. Sometimes, it's the wife's problem, you know.\r\n                            15:12\r\n                            But fairness is common sense.\r\n                            15:18\r\n                            A woman: (unintelligible).\r\n                            15:27\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: It's all common sense. These verses specifically deal with this practice. It was terribly unfair. It's actually happening now.\r\n                            15:38\r\n                            When I was in Saudi Arabia, I would listen to... They have a radio program where people write letters and complain.\r\n                            15:46\r\n                            This is their way of getting the solution, of getting somebody's attention. And you would be amazed how many problems there are where wives are locked up for months.\r\n                            15:56\r\n                            They don't even see their husband. But they sneak out a letter somehow to the radio station.\r\n                            16:04\r\n                            It's a program that makes you cry. It's a problem (unintelligible). So, this is the kind of problem that these verses address.\r\n                            16:14\r\n                            It is a form of slavery, and maybe this is why the expiation is to free a slave.\r\n                            16:22\r\n                            And then, Robert said, there are no slaves now, but the Quran provides alternatives.\r\n                            16:29\r\n                            If you don't have a slave, you go find a slave, and you free him, or free her.\r\n                            16:35\r\n                            And if this is not possible, it is not possible now, then you fast two consecutive months,\r\n                            16:43\r\n                            which is indicative of the grossness of the offense. This is...This is...\r\n                            16:48\r\n                            If you kill somebody by mistake, this is the expiation for killing somebody by mistake.\r\n                            16:57\r\n                            And if you cannot fast two consecutive months, then you have to feed 64 people. Just the same as Ramadan. If you cannot fast in the month of Ramadan, you feed one poor person, for every day you break the fast.\r\n                            17:10\r\n                            So, you can see the work of existence of God is good.\r\n                            17:17\r\n                            So, this is for you to believe in God and His messengers. These are God's laws.\r\n                            17:22\r\n                            Because people who adhere to these commandments prove that they believe in God.\r\n                            17:28\r\n                            And when we follow the commandments, we attain certainty.\r\n                            17:35\r\n                            The obligations, as Robert mentioned, these obligations are not for God's benefit, but for our benefit.\r\n                            17:43\r\n                            And the most, the best thing out of those obligations is attaining certainty.\r\n                            17:52\r\n                            When you do the five Prayers, if you miss a Prayer, you get a pinch immediately. Eventually, it's gonna sink in our head that God has (unintelligible).\r\n                            18:01\r\n                            How does one know that they missed a Noon Prayer? So, it happens gradually. You're gonna have this conviction and this certainty.\r\n                            18:13\r\n                            Another thing I want to comment on is no people meet without God being there.\r\n                            18:24\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: What verse it was? Robert: 7. Dr. Khalifa: [58:7] Do you not realize that GOD knows everything in the heavens and the earth? No three people can meet in secrecy without Him being their fourth,...\r\n                            18:35\r\n                            So, when God says, He protects you and people who are conspiring to do harm to you, God is there.\r\n                            18:44\r\n                            God's angels are there, too. But I want us to visualize God is with us. God is here.\r\n                            18:52\r\n                            And subconsciously think that God is here. Do the snap. He knows that you're studying His Word.\r\n                            Believing in the invisible dimension. God’s protection. Being united, those who “break away from the group Satan attacks”.\r\n                            19:00\r\n                            It's an awesome feeling. But we have to acquire it once in a while. We have to realize that God is here. God is with us. Always.\r\n                            19:10\r\n                            And as believers, this is also... Believing in the invisible is very important.\r\n                            19:16\r\n                            Just because we are in this dimension and we see each other, we can't ignore that other dimension.\r\n                            19:25\r\n                            The invisible dimension.\r\n                            19:31\r\n                            Behind each one of you, or next to you, is a big, huge, invisible giant protecting you.\r\n                            19:40\r\n                            I'm laughing because there was a... I just glanced at the TV the other day and there was a child with a dragon, invisible dragon.\r\n                            19:50\r\n                            They have something like this video. So, nobody can harm you. Nothing can harm you.\r\n                            19:59\r\n                            So, it's just not, not just being conscious of God, but also being conscious of the guards. God put to guard you and guard your children and guard all your affairs.\r\n                            20:18\r\n                            Prohibiting the Conspiracy. God says in Sura 42, the whole Sura is titled \"Consultation.\"\r\n                            20:28\r\n                            And this is... Alhamdu Lillah, we already achieved this. We're all just one unit.\r\n                            20:34\r\n                            And we all become one family. Day after day, Friday after Friday, we are the same people who are meeting here. Dedicated.\r\n                            20:45\r\n                            It's been wonderful. We've just become a family. So, we don't have this problem anymore. Except that God taught us what this is in the past.\r\n                            20:56\r\n                            And (unintelligible) to take a boat (unintelligible) Opposition. (unintelligible)\r\n                            21:09\r\n                            Remember what (unintelligible)\r\n                            21:16\r\n                            A woman: (unintelligible)\r\n                            21:22\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, we agree on that, yes. No, but that was opposition. (unintelligible)\r\n                            21:33\r\n                            Ok. I forget. But we did see examples of this and as time went by, the people who did these kinds of conspiracies turned out to be unbelievers.\r\n                            21:44\r\n                            They just didn't have it. They never saw the miracle. They never appreciated it.\r\n                            21:49\r\n                            And they disappeared. That was years ago.\r\n                            21:55\r\n                            So, this verses 8 and 9 remind us of being always a united group.\r\n                            22:08\r\n                            Our affairs based on consultation. Satan is like the wolf. The wolf only attacks the straying sheep.\r\n                            22:17\r\n                            (unintelligible)\r\n                            22:25\r\n                            Are there any questions on these? They're not to be... By the way, this Sura... this is the only Sura in the Quran... This is a certain piece of information on the side.\r\n                            22:39\r\n                            From computer facts, this is the only Sura in the Quran where the name of God is in every verse.\r\n                            22:46\r\n                            At least once. This Sura here. The only one in the whole Quran where every verse has the word \"Allah\" in it, at least once.\r\n                            22:56\r\n                            Some of the verses have 4 of them. A man: 57 Allah.\r\n                            23:01\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Say it again. A man: 57 God. 57 times. Dr. Khalifa: Really? Oh, my goodness.\r\n                            23:08\r\n                            Alright. Here's another piece of information.\r\n                            23:14\r\n                            So, these are the fine details that we are blessed to know,\r\n                            23:22\r\n                            when the average so-called Muslim doesn't even know how many Suras are in the Quran.\r\n                            23:36\r\n                            Ok. I thought you were saying something.\r\n                            23:47\r\n                            Ok, if there are no questions we'll go back to Robert. Oh, Abdullah.\r\n                            23:53\r\n                            Abdullah: On 7, when God says \"there are no three people can meet in secrecy, without Him being the fourth.\"\r\n                            24:02\r\n                            Then, next one. Literally, it should come up like \"nor four people being, without being Him the fifth\",\r\n                            24:14\r\n                            but jumped to \"five.\" Actually, when you read it, you can't really notice it, because it goes three, four, five, six.\r\n                            24:23\r\n                            Abdullah: But the thing is, we know that, actually these numbers are counted, because if it was four and five, then the sum of the numbers will be short.\r\n                            24:35\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Exactly. Abdullah: A couple of numbers. But the way God put it, you can't really notice it, if you read it a million times.\r\n                            24:43\r\n                            See, it's so fluent. (unintelligible)\r\n                            24:49\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: How come it didn't say \"two people, God will be the third\", and so on? Because these numbers, what God is emphasizing is that the numbers are part of the mathematical code.\r\n                            25:00\r\n                            And the total is a multiple of 19, the number of numbers and the total of the numbers.\r\n                            25:07\r\n                            Abdullah: Actually, the reason that God didn't start from two is because the verse ends with, it says \"nor less than this, nor more.\" Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            25:16\r\n                            Abdullah: If it starts with two, there is no less of two, because you can't have one people conspiring.\r\n                            25:26\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Unless you are schizophrenic. Conspiring with yourself.\r\n                            25:42\r\n                            Very good point. Mã Shã Allãh. You see, nor less than this, nor more, covers the whole range of numbers.\r\n                            25:52\r\n                            So, it's true. If the verse starts with two, then less than that would be one conspiring with who!\r\n                            26:02\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: (unintelligible) of the messenger.\r\n                            26:10\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: Why does (unintelligible) disobedience of God and messenger?\r\n                            26:16\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Well, apparently, the word \"conspiracy\" is against the messenger, in particular.\r\n                            26:23\r\n                            See, this verse is dealing with conspiracy. [58:9] O you who believe, if you have to confer secretly, you shall not confer to commit sin, transgression, and disobedience to the messenger. You may confer only to work righteousness and piety. Beware of God,...\r\n                            26:36\r\n                            It's a specific commandment dealing with conspiring against the messenger.\r\n                            26:43\r\n                            Dr. Sabahi: Does it mean that obedience of the messenger is required (unintelligible)?\r\n                            26:51\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Well, it's a blessing, yes. See, what is happening, when there is a messenger, God is sending information to the whole group through the messenger.\r\n                            “Saves a lot of trouble” if we obey the messenger. Community of Submitters debated age of 40, wastes a lot of time.\r\n                            27:01\r\n                            And the messenger himself is benefiting from this information. So, it will save us a lot of trouble if we obey him.\r\n                            27:10\r\n                            This includes the messenger and the people, because this information comes to everybody.\r\n                            27:16\r\n                            Actually, I see this in my last trip to Canada, for example.\r\n                            27:27\r\n                            I mentioned the issue of the age of 40, and I assumed that everybody accepted it.\r\n                            27:35\r\n                            But they didn't, and I ended up wasting so much time on it. And it's a blessing if the people have the understanding of, for example, this verse.\r\n                            27:46\r\n                            They'd be so comfortable if they have the conviction and understanding. They will not waste so much time arguing back and forth, you know.\r\n                            27:54\r\n                            Why 40? How can a person who is terrified go to Heaven if he didn't do this and that?\r\n                            28:01\r\n                            Ok. But it's a piece of information that God sent to us and gave us the proofs and the evidence and a number from the Quran.\r\n                            28:08\r\n                            So, a person who has, who is blessed... God says \"it's a blessing\" because it saves us a lot of time.\r\n                            28:14\r\n                            It's finished. It's closed. Ok. When we say \"God says \"up to 40, everybody goes to Heaven.\r\n                            28:21\r\n                            And here's the number in the Quran. And here are the proofs. Here are the signs.\" Then, we're convinced.\r\n                            28:27\r\n                            So, it's a blessing. So, I appreciate the fact that this verse deals specifically with disobedience to the messenger.\r\n                            28:40\r\n                            It's obedience in matters that have to do with God and the information that's coming from God.\r\n                            28:47\r\n                            It's not personal obedience. It's obedience to God because it's the information that's coming from God.\r\n                            28:58\r\n                            And we have in history... the history tells us they were having a battle or something and the Prophet Muhammad said \"let us camp here.\"\r\n                            29:06\r\n                            And they went to him and they said \"this is information from you or from God?\" \"If it's from God, we'll do that.\"\r\n                            29:12\r\n                            He said \"no, it's from me.\" They said \"this is a stupid idea.\" (unintelligible)\r\n                            29:19\r\n                            So, once he said \"it's from me\", they were free not to obey.\r\n                            29:24\r\n                            So, the obedience is really to God. This is actually written in history. \"Then, we're all dead if we obey you.\"\r\n                            29:32\r\n                            And they did move on to some other place.\r\n                            29:40\r\n                            A woman: (unintelligible)\r\n                            30:13\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Okay, we'll... just we do have a part where we ask general questions.\r\n                            30:19\r\n                            So, that falls under the general questions.\r\n                            30:24\r\n                            We have to let Robert finish. It will take about 10 minutes to discuss circumcision.\r\n                            30:32\r\n                            Robert: Okay, verse 10.\r\n                            30:37\r\n                            Ok. [58:10] Conspiracy is from the devil, only causing problems to those who believe, though he cannot harm them against the will of GOD. In GOD the believers shall trust.\r\n                            30:49\r\n                            [58:11] O you who believe, if you are asked to make room for others to sit down with you, you shall make room. Then, GOD will make room for you. If you are asked to leave, you shall leave. GOD raises those among you who believe, and those who attain knowledge to higher ranks. GOD is fully Cognizant of everything you do.\r\n                            31:07\r\n                            [58:12] O you who believe, if you wish to confer with the messenger, you shall give away a... [58:14] ... And they deliberately swear lies!\r\n                            31:15\r\n                            [58:15] GOD has prepared for them a severe retribution. Evil indeed is what they did.\r\n                            31:21\r\n                            [58:16] They used their oaths as a cover to repel others from the path of GOD. Consequently, they have deserved humiliating retribution.\r\n                            31:29\r\n                            [58:17] Never will their money or children help them against GOD. They will have deserved Hell, wherein they abide forever.\r\n                            31:36\r\n                            [58:18] On the Day when GOD resurrects them, they will swear to Him, just as they swear to you, and they will think they have some basis. Indeed, they are liars.\r\n                            31:46\r\n                            [58:19] The devil possessed them, and persuaded them to neglect GOD's message. These are the party of the devil. The party of the devil are the losers.\r\n                            31:56\r\n                            [58:20] Those who oppose GOD and His messenger are the lowliest. [58:21] GOD has decreed: \"I and My messengers will always win.\" GOD is Powerful, Almighty.\r\n                            i.e conspiracies “some people decided they wanted a separate Quranic study and use different translations”.\r\n                            32:06\r\n                            Ok. And here again, we're talking about conspiracy as being from the devil.\r\n                            32:16\r\n                            Conspiracy then meaning plotting, plotting against, to do wrong.\r\n                            32:23\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Right. Robert: Ok. Cause... Dr. Khalifa: I wish I could think of something specific. Those happened, what, years ago.\r\n                            32:31\r\n                            Robert: Because couldn't you also look at... Abdullah: Yeah, that's what I was... Dr. Khalifa: Right. Abdullah: Last (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Yes, exactly.\r\n                            32:39\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: See, I forgot... Abdullah: These people were very opposed... Dr. Khalifa: And they all dropped off.\r\n                            32:46\r\n                            Some people decided they wanna have a separate Quranic study and to look at other translations.\r\n                            32:52\r\n                            And... Just to break, break away.\r\n                            32:58\r\n                            On a separate night. They did and they're all done.\r\n                            33:06\r\n                            Proved to be unbelievers. I mean, we really know that they are unbelievers.\r\n                            33:12\r\n                            A woman: (unintelligible)\r\n                            33:20\r\n                            Abdullah: (unintelligible) their actions are (unintelligible)\r\n                            33:30\r\n                            He was against totally you being in charge. That's typical for him to go against messenger of God.\r\n                            33:39\r\n                            Not listening to one that God has chosen as a messenger who is in charge. (unintelligible) Remember, he wanted...\r\n                            33:46\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: It's coming to me now, I remember. Abdullah: Yeah, he came, wanted the Quranic study to all (unintelligible) to debate this (unintelligible).\r\n                            33:57\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: He was, he was fooled by somebody who we know. is an FBI informer. We didn't mind him being here.\r\n                            Different study group’s derived “strangest conclusions” i.e. debated the story of the camel being slaughtered.\r\n                            34:10\r\n                            He fooled the guy. I remember this detail.\r\n                            34:15\r\n                            They're all gone. So, that's the kind of conspiracy. It's not good. It divides the group. It has no good results.\r\n                            34:22\r\n                            It's amazing, by the way. When these things happened, people went and they had their own Quranic study.\r\n                            34:33\r\n                            For example, they came out with the strangest conclusions, from the same Quran.\r\n                            34:40\r\n                            I can tell you that Satan gets hold of them or something, confusing every issue for them.\r\n                            34:46\r\n                            And eventually, I will remember some of the ideas that came out. Cause they are very strange ideas.\r\n                            34:53\r\n                            And you know, it makes sense. (unintelligible) inferences \"That's right, you can derive this meaning from this verse. But that's not what it says.\"\r\n                            35:03\r\n                            If you twist words, you can come up with certain meanings. So hopefully, I will remember some specific examples.\r\n                            35:11\r\n                            But when people... It says here, actually. \"Conspiracy is from the devil.\" There we go.\r\n                            35:17\r\n                            Ok. \"Conspiracy is from the devil.\" And these people who forced their opinion, and they went to study the Quran,\r\n                            35:26\r\n                            I'm remembering some of the ideas.\r\n                            35:37\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Abdullah: Oh, yes. Dr. Khalifa: Oh, yes. Oh, my God. Abdullah: Oh, my God. Dr. Khalifa: Now, listen to this. Now, you're gonna get a kick out of this. Yeah. Thank you. You reminded me.\r\n                            35:46\r\n                            The word, they said that Saleh... Yeah, this came out of their group.\r\n                            35:51\r\n                            The old timers will remember this. They said... now Saleh said \"this is God's camel. Let it be, have its own drink some places.\"\r\n                            36:03\r\n                            And then they slaughtered the camel. So, the word... now people underaged, excuse us, but they said that they had sex with the camel.\r\n                            36:12\r\n                            By (unintelligible) the camel. A man: What?! A woman: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: That's what came out of their group.\r\n                            36:19\r\n                            Abdullah: They're very sick. You're right. Dr. Khalifa: Is this what I said?\r\n                            36:24\r\n                            I said \"where did you get that?\" They said \"the word did not mean...\"\r\n                            36:29\r\n                            They wanted a specific word that means slaughtering. And actually, the word is specific enough, but it is not a common word.\r\n                            36:39\r\n                            So, this is one of the examples that \"Conspiracy is from the devil.\"\r\n                            36:44\r\n                            And they actually came back and they argued with me. They said \"why do you translate it as they slaughtered the camel?\"\r\n                            36:51\r\n                            So, we really are living the Quran. \"Conspiracy is from the devil.\" Obviously, the devil gave them that idea.\r\n                            36:59\r\n                            A man: Also, the people were reading from the... They were translating from the Arabic to English. They were not using this?\r\n                            37:10\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: I think they used both. They used Arabic and English. They had some other translations. A man: And they were using it all together?\r\n                            37:17\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yes, they have. Actually, you must be a fool to have that idea.\r\n                            37:25\r\n                            Martha, you know Arabic. The word is فَعَقَرُوا۟ عَقَرُوا۟ And the word is عَقَرُوا۟\r\n                            37:31\r\n                            This is \"slaughtering the camel.\" So, the word in the Quran,\r\n                            37:36\r\n                            what they did, the camel was slaughtered. So, they said عَقَرُوا۟ means\r\n                            37:42\r\n                            They're having sex with the camel. They're not killing it.\r\n                            37:48\r\n                            Perverts.\r\n                            37:53\r\n                            \"Conspiracy is from the devil.\" You know, this is what happens if we separate ourselves from the believers. The world forgets us.\r\n                            38:05\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Ok, back to Robert. Robert: Ok. Dr. Khalifa: We should remember this. Robert: [58:10] Conspiracy is from the devil, though he cannot harm them against the will of GOD. In GOD the believers shall trust.\r\n                            38:17\r\n                            That's right there. Quite an impressive sentence. [58:10] ....In GOD the believers shall trust.\r\n                            38:24\r\n                            That right there should put everybody's mind at ease. When you're worried about things of any matter,\r\n                            38:33\r\n                            whether it be daily life to anything.\r\n                            38:41\r\n                            [58:11] O you who believe, make room for those who sit. Then, GOD will make room for you....\r\n                            38:49\r\n                            Now to me, this verse... What I thought of it as... As being righteous when someone...\r\n                            38:55\r\n                            make room for somebody else to sit down. You're... I'm sure we (unintelligible) let somebody else sit down.\r\n                            39:00\r\n                            And that God will make room for you in Heaven. This applied to...\r\n                            39:07\r\n                            Could be from my background or something. That where...\r\n                            39:13\r\n                            Clothe the needy, feed the hungry. This type of... That's what came to my mind when I read this verse.\r\n                            39:20\r\n                            I don't know if that's... If that's along the same lines. But that's how I applied it.\r\n                            39:26\r\n                            Especially the part that \"God may make room for you.\" I thought, I thought that was in terms of... Dr. Khalifa: Actually, it's happened now, literally in this room.\r\n                            39:33\r\n                            Behrouz, did you find a place to sit down? Did you ask somebody to move?\r\n                            39:40\r\n                            Did you have to ask somebody to move? Behrouz: No. Dr. Khalifa: Ok. Dr. Khalifa: But it's possible he comes in and finds that there's nobody...There's no room. And He asks somebody to make room for him.\r\n                            39:52\r\n                            You can take it literal or that it covers issues. A man: Also, think of it as be considerate.\r\n                            39:58\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Exactly. A man: Be kind to others. Dr. Khalifa: Exactly. Dr. Khalifa: Be considerate to others. It's a general principle.\r\n                            40:05\r\n                            Otherwise, if you're nice to the people, do unto others like... Robert: As you would have... Right. Dr. Khalifa: God will be kind to you, like He is kind to others.\r\n                            40:13\r\n                            Robert: Okay. Dr. Khalifa: If you all come and say \"please, move...\" (unintelligible) Just make it considerate.\r\n                            40:22\r\n                            Robert: [58:11] ...GOD raises those among you who believe, and those who attain knowledge to higher ranks...\r\n                            40:28\r\n                            Okay. There again, God raises those among you. In other words, God guides those among... God guides the believers and the people who attain knowledge, He brings them to higher ranks.\r\n                            40:38\r\n                            A man: (unintelligible) A man: But why (unintelligible) that they have a high level of righteousness.\r\n                            40:49\r\n                            [58:11] ... GOD is fully Cognizant of everything you do. There again, when you see that at the end of the verse, then you can apply some of the other things in terms of...\r\n                            40:58\r\n                            He's fully Cognizant of all your actions in terms of... That's why every little thing as to letting a person sit down and being righteous in that manner\r\n                            41:08\r\n                            is only seen as a benefit to you.\r\n                            41:13\r\n                            It's seen as a plus. Or as a credit, as we always say.\r\n                            41:19\r\n                            [58:12] O you who believe, if you wish to confer with the messenger, you shall give away a charity before you confer with him...\r\n                            41:24\r\n                            Okay, I saw this as being another means for... another situation where God allows us to give to charity.\r\n                            41:32\r\n                            Just another situation where He says \"if you have the money, before you confer with the messenger, give to charity.\"\r\n                            41:38\r\n                            That's another situation where God is allowing us to, to grow, essentially. That's how I looked at it.\r\n                            41:43\r\n                            Because underneath that, He says \"if you don't have the money, God is Forgiver, Merciful.\r\n                            41:49\r\n                            So, that's... I looked at that as the situation where human beings tend to be greedy.\r\n                            41:56\r\n                            And this is a way for us to give. Dr. Khalifa: Exactly. An excuse. Robert: Right.\r\n                            42:04\r\n                            Robert: Ok. [58:13] If you have failed to give to charity before your conference, repent thereafter,... You shall observe the Salat Prayers, and Zakat charity, and obey GOD and His messenger. GOD is Cognizant of everything you do.\r\n                            42:18\r\n                            This is again, just reflect upon your actions and repent.\r\n                            42:27\r\n                            [58:14] There are those who lie themselves with people who have angered God. They neither belong with you nor with them, and they deliberately swear lies!\r\n                            42:35\r\n                            Ok. This is a very important verse in terms of allying yourself with people who are believers\r\n                            42:44\r\n                            like yourself so that you may also, so they will help you, I guess you would say, to grow yourselves.\r\n                            42:52\r\n                            When you're around people who, as it says here, \"angered God\" or are disbelievers, their actions tend to be...\r\n                            43:03\r\n                            Again, I'm not judging their actions. Some things that are said or done, you can look upon them in a non-righteous light, which\r\n                            43:14\r\n                            doesn't further your progress along the lines of, along the right path.\r\n                            43:20\r\n                            If you wanna keep yourself on the right path, the best way to do that is to align yourself with believers, or surround yourself with believers.\r\n                            43:27\r\n                            [58:15] GOD has prepared for them a severe retribution. Evil indeed is what they did.\r\n                            43:33\r\n                            Okay, this obviously refers to the angering of God in the above verse.\r\n                            43:41\r\n                            Robert: Is there something, is that... what... Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Robert: Is there a specific thing that this applies to in terms of how these people angered God, or \"evil indeed is what they did\"?\r\n                            43:54\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, they allied themselves with the enemies of God. Actually, we have examples of these.\r\n                            44:03\r\n                            People who would, for example, ally themselves. I'm talking about somebody who goes to the Islamic Center.\r\n                            44:14\r\n                            In the Islamic Center, they (unintelligible) with worshippers. They don't devote their Prayer to God alone.\r\n                            44:21\r\n                            And you know that they anger God when they do this. They will not accept \"La Elaha Ella Allah.\" If you go there and tell them \"La Elaha Ella Allah\", they call you \"KAFIR.\"\r\n                            44:31\r\n                            A man: This doesn't make sense. (unintelligible)\r\n                            44:37\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible) They're criticizing me for saying that Salman Rushdie should have the freedom of expression,\r\n                            44:46\r\n                            And in that letter they say \"we agree, we admire, or we applaud the Catholic Church\r\n                            44:55\r\n                            \"for making a stand against Salman Rushdie.\" So, this is the Islamic Center attacking me, and applauding the Catholic Church.\r\n                            Talk of Catholic Church and their supporters.\r\n                            45:06\r\n                            Ok. Now, I say \"La Elaha Ella Allah.\" The Catholic Church says \"Praise Mary, Mother of God.\"\r\n                            45:15\r\n                            So, it is not an issue of worshipping God, it's politics or something. How can they applaud the Catholic Church for anything?\r\n                            45:23\r\n                            Of course, the Catholic Church itself practices the same thing that Khomeini practices. They don't like people to write about their Shroud of Turin and all the nonsense that they have.\r\n                            45:34\r\n                            And they have heavy censorship. They excommunicate people right and left because of their opinions.\r\n                            45:42\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: So, they are (unintelligible). A woman: (unintelligible)\r\n                            45:50\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Right. We had... A woman: ...which was exactly the same thing. A woman: It's nice that they're right here, one right after the other. Dr. Khalifa: Exactly.\r\n                            45:56\r\n                            A woman: So, you just see how against them both groups are. Dr. Khalifa: You can see how will God look at people like this for applauding people who are saying \"Praise Mary, Mother of God.\"\r\n                            46:17\r\n                            and condemning somebody who says \"La Elaha Ella Allah. Worship God alone.\"\r\n                            46:22\r\n                            So, anybody who allies himself with those people, God is angry with them.\r\n                            46:29\r\n                            This is verse 15. [58:15] GOD has prepared for them severe retribution. Evil indeed is what they did.\r\n                            46:34\r\n                            Robert: They're saying that there are those who ally themselves with people who have angered God.\r\n                            46:41\r\n                            Ok. A woman: (unintelligible)\r\n                            46:47\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yeah. \"Hail Mary, Mother of God. The Lord is with thee.\" A woman: (unintelligible)\r\n                            46:55\r\n                            Robert: \"Blessed are thou.\" A woman: (unintelligible)\r\n                            47:03\r\n                            and there's the (unintelligible)\r\n                            47:22\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, it doesn't make sense. Mary is dead. Jesus is dead. How can you bless the womb when the woman is dead?\r\n                            47:28\r\n                            A woman: (unintelligible)\r\n                            47:34\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Why do you (unintelligible) to him? (unintelligible) is dead.\r\n                            47:40\r\n                            She's great. I mean, she's in God's grace. I'm the one who needs the submission. She made it.\r\n                            47:46\r\n                            A woman: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Why?\r\n                            48:00\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: She's dead. A woman: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: She's dead.\r\n                            48:05\r\n                            A woman: Yeah, I know she's dead. Dr. Khalifa: Right. A woman: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible) A woman: (unintelligible)\r\n                            48:13\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Ok. Let me put it this way. Instead of saying \"Subhan Allah. God be glorified. God be praised,\" because God is alive.\r\n                            48:19\r\n                            (unintelligible). He's the One that we worship. You don't need to mention Mary or Muhammad or Jesus or anybody.\r\n                            48:26\r\n                            That's the point. A woman: (unintelligible)\r\n                            48:36\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible). We need it. I need it. Robert: Yeah. Robert: Want me to, want me to just read these last verses? Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible) God's blessings with guidance.\r\n                            48:45\r\n                            Robert: and then we can get on with the other discussion. A woman: (unintelligible) and I don't know Arabic but\r\n                            48:51\r\n                            the fact is, the fact is that Muhammad is only a messenger. There's nothing wrong with that. A woman: You said, you said \"You shouldn't say it in conjunction with God.\" Dr. Khalifa: with God.\r\n                            49:01\r\n                            A woman: because then you should mention every prophet, every messenger. We don't even know them.\r\n                            49:07\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Because God... there's a commandment that says \"Do not make distinction among God's messengers.\" A man: Excuse me. Can we let Robert finish these?\r\n                            49:13\r\n                            Robert: I just... Should I just read this last verse? Because you wanted to discuss the other... Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Robert: Yeah. And then...\r\n                            49:22\r\n                            A woman: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible) Robert: Oh, that's all right. There's only one verse left. Dr. Khalifa: Go ahead. Robert: Ok.\r\n                            49:28\r\n                            Verse 22. Run For Your Life [58:22] You will not find people who believe in GOD and the Last Day befriending those who oppose GOD and His messenger, even if they were their own parents, or children, or siblings, or family.\r\n                            49:40\r\n                            God places faith into their hearts as He supports them with inspiration. He will admit them into the gardens with flowing streams where they abide forever. GOD is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him. They are the party of GOD. And the party of God are winners.\r\n                            49:55\r\n                            This verse is incredibly strong. I think, just from looking at Mr. Khalifa's own situation.\r\n                            50:05\r\n                            This really truly proves, if you're a believer, if you can ally yourself with God, even when your family is an obstacle for you.\r\n                            50:19\r\n                            That's, that's truly showing that you're a believer. That is confirming to yourself when you can put God above all things, especially someone that's so close as your family.\r\n                            50:31\r\n                            And when those people feel that they are doing the right things themselves.\r\n                            50:39\r\n                            God is the one. As you go back \"in God, the believers shall trust.\"\r\n                            50:45\r\n                            That says it all right there. And you have to put God above everything else, regardless of who it is.\r\n                            50:53\r\n                            And to do this is oftentimes very difficult. But if you truly believe, then you'll be in the party of God, who are winners.\r\n                            Follower talks of his experience and journey to Submission.\r\n                            51:06\r\n                            A man: Is there anything else? A man: No, this, this answers your question earlier on.\r\n                            51:12\r\n                            You asked about the people that oppose the messenger.\r\n                            51:17\r\n                            And here it is. The verse says [58:22] You will not find people who believe in GOD and the Last Day befriending those who oppose GOD and His messenger,...\r\n                            51:30\r\n                            Keikhosrow Emami: We have not, in any kind of a way, been forced to practice religion.\r\n                            51:37\r\n                            Rather, open-minded family, I'm proud of them.\r\n                            51:43\r\n                            But in my heart, I've been always searching. I told Dr. Khalifa, I was 16 years old when I felt like I wanna go to a masjid.\r\n                            51:53\r\n                            I did. The second time I went to the masjid, I was turned off.\r\n                            51:59\r\n                            Because it wasn't for me. Things that I heard, it was not simply logical.\r\n                            52:07\r\n                            Of course, I'm 46 now, but I've been growing up. I've gone through so much. You know, you all know how we go through the steps.\r\n                            52:15\r\n                            We get busy with other matters. We come and go.\r\n                            52:20\r\n                            But one thing never went away from me, it was my thirst for God.\r\n                            52:31\r\n                            And then later on, I got very, very interested in Quran. I don't know the reason, but I was just very interested.\r\n                            52:42\r\n                            It sounds a little off. A man comes from Tehran, Iran, and he finds God in the United States of America.\r\n                            52:54\r\n                            I call that destiny. It was in 1983, or perhaps, I believe it was 1983.\r\n                            53:04\r\n                            Somehow, some kind of a way, I came across with 1 and 9.\r\n                            53:11\r\n                            Makes it number 19. And I was fascinated. I was fascinated. That's why I went ahead and got a Quran and I was\r\n                            53:19\r\n                            going around and bragging about it. \"Hey guys,...\" actually, I was talking to a Jewish fellow one time,\r\n                            53:25\r\n                            Iranian guy, and I didn't know he was Jewish. And I was telling him \"look, look, what do you want? I mean, this is it. This is it.\"\r\n                            53:32\r\n                            And he even didn't tell me he was Jewish. Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible)\r\n                            53:41\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Go on. Dr. Khalifa: Go ahead. Keikhosrow Emami: So, But as I said, as it comes and it goes, the first wave didn't knock me out, but just warmed me up.\r\n                            53:55\r\n                            And, but again, I'm in transportation business. If you all ever come to Atlanta, you can ask who KE is. They call me KE.\r\n                            54:04\r\n                            I owned the second largest taxi fleet in town, but I sold it. Of course, and I'm happy. I still have much to be thankful.\r\n                            54:14\r\n                            If you ask them what his radio number is, they're gonna tell you \"it's 19.\" I have a property very close to downtown. It is on Highway 19.\r\n                            54:25\r\n                            And IN SHAA ALLAH, I've got good plans. I'm not coming to Tucson to live in here, but my goodness, I envy you in a way.\r\n                            54:32\r\n                            My heart is with you. But I'll tell you one thing. You will come to the masjid in Atlanta, IN SHAA ALLAH.\r\n                            54:42\r\n                            It was a few months ago. Again, I don't know what happened. I was just, I wanted Quran again.\r\n                            54:50\r\n                            I mean, never gave it up, but this time I really wanted it. I mean, I wanted Quran.\r\n                            54:56\r\n                            So, I went through my papers. I found the address of Masjid Tucson again, wrote a letter, asked for a few books, and I got them.\r\n                            55:09\r\n                            But this time, it knocked me out.\r\n                            55:16\r\n                            It knocked me out. I talked to Dr. Khalifa many times, a few times on the phone, actually. And I told him, when I was telling him,\r\n                            55:27\r\n                            \"I have no doubt. I never meant that I never doubted you.\" When I was saying, I said \"I don't doubt. I have no doubt that Quran is indeed that communication which is direct.\"\r\n                            55:40\r\n                            I didn't know that he had made any announcement, actually, at the time. This came to me about 3 and a half, 3, max 4 weeks ago.\r\n                            55:49\r\n                            But let me say this to you. Without even the announcement, I was intelligent enough to see that, my goodness, there's got to be something.\r\n                            56:05\r\n                            Now, if you all sleep tonight, and tomorrow you see a flying saucer in here, in Tucson, Arizona,\r\n                            56:11\r\n                            and the crowds go around it, and there's no door, you can't figure it out. Then all of a sudden, somebody from the crowd steps forward, and he goes towards it, and does something, and the door opens,\r\n                            56:23\r\n                            and he gets in it, and he flies around, and maneuver around, and he lands it again,\r\n                            56:29\r\n                            don't you believe that somehow those who made the flying saucer taught him something?\r\n                            56:38\r\n                            He got some kind of a training from them? It is simply simple logic.\r\n                            56:47\r\n                            So, in the back of my mind, I was saying that, well, there's got to be something special. He's blessed. He's blessed.\r\n                            56:54\r\n                            So, it was February publication, Muslim Perspectives, when I got it, and it says \"Give me only one reason.\"\r\n                            57:08\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa, that was the first time I looked at what you said. So, hey, I'm fresh.\r\n                            57:16\r\n                            And \"only one reason. I've produced so many Quranic evidences, proofs.\r\n                            57:24\r\n                            \"You just give me one simple reason\", and not for a second, you know, backed off, didn't back off, even though I was expecting it.\r\n                            57:32\r\n                            But, I loved it. I loved it, and I loved him, too.\r\n                            57:38\r\n                            I just decided, I said \"hey, Khosrow, don't overdo it. Don't love him too much.\"\r\n                            57:44\r\n                            Because I'll be just as, just as guilty, probably, I'll make another Jesus Christ, or Prophet Muhammad.\r\n                            57:54\r\n                            You see, you go through these things, and things do make sense. They asked Prophet Muhammad \"bring a ladder, go up to the heaven, bring the whole book together, show it to us.\"\r\n                            58:05\r\n                            The miracles are performed, of course, but again, miracles come on in all different forms and fashions.\r\n                            58:16\r\n                            I am simply overwhelmed. I have a good friend of mine, Andy Mote, and we were talking with a couple of Sunni Muslims\r\n                            58:26\r\n                            and a couple of Shias, and the Sunnis asked, you know, they wanted to\r\n                            58:33\r\n                            at least eliminate some of the opposition to what they were saying. They said, well, he looks like blonde and American,\r\n                            58:40\r\n                            \"Well, you must be Christian.\" He says \"no, I'm hoping to become a Muslim.\"\r\n                            58:47\r\n                            So, I am a believer. I have no doubt.\r\n                            58:53\r\n                            As I said, two things I know. I don't expect him to perform miracles every second. I know he's a human.\r\n                            59:00\r\n                            I know he's gonna make mistakes. The rest of them did.\r\n                            59:06\r\n                            And I make sure that I control my emotions. I think I have overcome that. I will stay in Atlanta, and I think I have got my works cut up for me.\r\n                            59:18\r\n                            I think God has blessed me with a wonderful family.\r\n                            59:23\r\n                            I don't see I've got any weaknesses. I'm sure, but I think I'm okay, and I'm situated that I do good things.\r\n                            59:33\r\n                            I've got good plans. I am gonna be naturally communicating every step that I take with Dr. Khalifa and have his coaching and his approval.\r\n                            59:48\r\n                            And IN SHAA ALLAH, I'm looking forward to good things.\r\n                            59:57\r\n                            I feel God. An experience that I'd like to share with you, I've been always strong in my life.\r\n                            1:00:05\r\n                            My frame is not all that big, but even physically I've been strong.\r\n                            1:00:14\r\n                            I cannot be intimidated. I do my Prayer regularly. Yes, since when?\r\n                            1:00:22\r\n                            When I said \"well, yes, he is indeed the messenger.\" So, even when I was gonna Pray, I said \"no, I've got to get to the point. I wanna know how\r\n                            1:00:32\r\n                            \"I should Pray exactly\", because the Prayer that I used to do was a little different, not whole lot.\r\n                            1:00:41\r\n                            So, I waited until I got the tapes and everything. Since then, I have been Praying five times a day.\r\n                            1:00:49\r\n                            And truly, like he says, that this Contact Prayer, it is not good for... It's not for God.\r\n                            1:00:58\r\n                            It is simply, you establish that contact. It is the way you nourish your own self, you, your true self.\r\n                            1:01:10\r\n                            I feed me, like I feed my garments, like I exercise to keep my body trim.\r\n                            1:01:15\r\n                            So, therefore, I wanna exercise my mind and grow. I've been talking to my wife lately, and she says \"Khosrow, you're beginning to sound like (unintelligible). I hope not.\"\r\n                            1:01:29\r\n                            It is what I feel. It is my love for my family.\r\n                            1:01:36\r\n                            One thing I've made clear that I love him so much, but definitely, for sure, God is number one.\r\n                            1:01:47\r\n                            The experience I had, like Dr. Khalifa said \"there's a giant next to you protecting you.\"\r\n                            1:01:53\r\n                            Anybody doubts that? Anybody is doubting that?\r\n                            1:02:02\r\n                            I go to the Masjid on 14th Street and do my Prayer. And since the time I Prayed...\r\n                            \r\n                            26 Quran Study From Behrouz 1626 Sura 67 By Gatut Hamid Argues With Rashad\r\n                            \r\n                            Gatut: (We seek) refuge in God from the rejected devil. Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.\r\n                            0:07\r\n                            We are in Sura 67, Kingship (Al-Mulk).\r\n                            0:15\r\n                            [67:1] Most exalted is the One in whose hands is all kingship, and He is Omnipotent.\r\n                            0:23\r\n                            Well, I have to stop here. The verse says very clearly that in God is all the Kingship.\r\n                            0:33\r\n                            So, Kingship means that He is the sole and the only authority in this whole universe.\r\n                            0:41\r\n                            And He is also Omnipotent according to this verse. We also learn from the Quran that God grants Kingship to whomever He wills, and He grants it to the believers.\r\n                            0:53\r\n                            In other words, we know that people who worship God alone and follow God's commandment alone,\r\n                            1:03\r\n                            God promised them that they will be sovereign, or. kings or queens on earth.\r\n                            1:09\r\n                            In other words, they have everything that they need.\r\n                            1:14\r\n                            Everything that they need will be in their fingertips without, you know, the headache of a celebrity\r\n                            1:20\r\n                            that we know, you know, needs bodyguards, protection from FBI, or you cannot go to Burger King\r\n                            1:30\r\n                            to eat if you want because that's the headache of being a celebrity. You have a prison on your own, but God's servants, the believers, have all this and can still\r\n                            1:41\r\n                            enjoy this, and they have anything that they want. And I think that's the biggest, you know,\r\n                            1:46\r\n                            even the richest person in the world cannot do that because they will go everywhere and everybody\r\n                            1:53\r\n                            or some people or some news reporter will follow them. You know, Sam Donaldson will follow them\r\n                            1:59\r\n                            and ask questions and all that. So, the believers don't have that kind of headache.\r\n                            2:06\r\n                            The same goes with the, you know, financial problems.\r\n                            2:11\r\n                            They don't need 10 million dollars, but they have everything that they need. They get good transportation. They get anything that they need, good clothings, without being, you know,\r\n                            2:24\r\n                            without worrying that the IRS will get into their pocket or something. Gatut: So,... Dr. Khalifa: All the food they can eat.\r\n                            2:30\r\n                            Gatut: All the food that they can eat. That's right. Which is what we have today. Alhamdu Lillah.\r\n                            2:36\r\n                            So, God grants kingship to whomever He wills, and according to the Quran, that is the believers.\r\n                            2:43\r\n                            Verse 2, The Purpose of Our Life. [67:2] The One who created death and life for the purpose of distinguishing those among you who would do better.* He is the Almighty, the Forgiving.\r\n                            2:58\r\n                            God created death and life to distinguish the human beings who are the real believers\r\n                            3:06\r\n                            and who are the wishy-washy ones. We all know that the purpose behind creating us here in this life and the whole universe is\r\n                            3:18\r\n                            because billions of years ago, we doubted God's Supreme Authority.\r\n                            3:25\r\n                            In other words, there is one guy who said \"well, I can be a god besides God.\" And we, all the human beings, this is before the creation of the heavens and the earth and,\r\n                            3:35\r\n                            you know, our stay here, we don't show our firm stand for God.\r\n                            3:41\r\n                            In other words, we said \"well, this guy who was Satan, he may have a point.\"\r\n                            3:47\r\n                            In other words, \"let's give him a try. Let's test him.\" So, we didn't have a firm stand as opposed to the angels, for instance, who said that\r\n                            3:55\r\n                            \"there is no way that anybody except God can rule the universe.\" So, God gave us the second chance to redeem ourselves and this is because of His Mercifulness.\r\n                            Dr. Rashad Khalifa talks of the “flawless” creation of the Universe.\r\n                            4:07\r\n                            God doesn't need to prove anything. He already knew. He knows what's gonna happen.\r\n                            4:14\r\n                            There's no future for Him because as far as He is concerned, everything is past. Everything has taken place.\r\n                            4:20\r\n                            Only He knew it. But we need to affirm to ourselves, in other words, on the Day of Judgment,\r\n                            4:27\r\n                            everybody will see with their own eyes that this is what they do, that they do not really believe or they are a real believer.\r\n                            4:36\r\n                            So, it is the human beings who need the affirmations. So, there'll be no excuses on the Day of Judgment.\r\n                            4:46\r\n                            And verse says that \"He is Almighty, the Forgiving.\" He is Forgiving because even though we committed the blasphemy, we committed the crime\r\n                            4:55\r\n                            that makes us, you know, here in this life right now, He didn't send us outright to Hell, but He gave us a second chance.\r\n                            5:05\r\n                            The angels said, of course, at the time when we were created \"why don't You just send them all to Hell?\"\r\n                            5:12\r\n                            God says \"I know what you do not know.\" Because God knows that some of the human beings will be redeemed.\r\n                            5:20\r\n                            And these are the believers. Number 3,\r\n                            5:26\r\n                            [67:3] He created seven universes in layers. You do not see any imperfection in the creation by the Most Gracious. Keep looking; do you see any flaw?\r\n                            5:36\r\n                            [67:4] Look again and again; your eyes will come back stumped and conquered.\r\n                            5:43\r\n                            [67:5] We adorned the lowest universe with lamps, and guarded its borders with projectiles against the devils; we prepared for them a retribution in Hell.\r\n                            5:55\r\n                            [67:6] For those who disbelieved in their Lord, the retribution of Gehenna. What a miserable destiny.\r\n                            6:03\r\n                            [67:7] When they get thrown therein, they hear its furor as it fumes. Number 8,\r\n                            6:09\r\n                            [67:8] It almost explodes from rage. Whenever a group is thrown therein, its guards would ask them, \"Did you not receive a warner?\"\r\n                            6:18\r\n                            [67:9] They would answer, \"Yes indeed; a warner did come to us, but we disbelieved and said, 'GOD did not reveal anything. You are totally astray.'\"\r\n                            6:28\r\n                            [67:10] They also say, \"If we heard or understood, we would not be among the dwellers of Hell!\"\r\n                            6:33\r\n                            [67:11] Thus, they confessed their sins. Woe to the dwellers of Hell.\r\n                            6:43\r\n                            Verse number 3, we learn from here that our universe is not the only universe that God created.\r\n                            6:50\r\n                            The scientists, the astronomers, are still trying to determine, you know, the limit or the borders of the universe where we live in.\r\n                            6:59\r\n                            And according to God, and this will be proven, IN SHAA ALLAH, in the near future, that\r\n                            7:07\r\n                            this universe is only one of the seven universes that God created. Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible)\r\n                            7:26\r\n                            Gatut: Our universe... Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Go ahead.\r\n                            7:32\r\n                            Gatut: Our universe we live in, we live in the, a little dot called the planet Earth, which is located in the solar system.\r\n                            7:45\r\n                            We have our own star, which is the sun. And our star is one of the hundreds of thousands of stars in our galaxy, which is the Milky Way galaxy.\r\n                            7:56\r\n                            And our Milky Way galaxy is one of the billions of galaxies in the universe that, you know, they stopped counting\r\n                            8:04\r\n                            because they couldn't get the total number. But the universe that we live in, which according to rough calculation is probably about 26\r\n                            8:17\r\n                            billion light years across, is only the smallest universe. That means that it takes 26 billion years for light to travel.\r\n                            8:27\r\n                            Billions with a B. So, that's how awesome is the innermost universe.\r\n                            8:32\r\n                            And there are six other universes around the innermost universe. And everything is, all the seven universes, according to the Quran, is in God's hand.\r\n                            8:50\r\n                            However, the innermost universe is also, according to verse number five, is actually the prison cell for Satan.\r\n                            9:02\r\n                            Because he cannot go beyond our universe. In Sura 72, verse 9, and also in Sura 15, verse 18, there's the same reference of, you know,\r\n                            9:15\r\n                            the guard of the universe that, you know, the jinns and Satan cannot go beyond because they will be pursued by projectiles.\r\n                            9:27\r\n                            But nobody can find any flaw in God's creation.\r\n                            9:38\r\n                            You know, we just look and lay down at a dark night when the moon is, you know, very young and look at the stars.\r\n                            9:46\r\n                            I used to do camping a long time ago when I was young. And I always, you know, lie down and look at the dark night and look at the stars.\r\n                            9:53\r\n                            And I'm always, you know, never ceased to be amazed how all these can become into being.\r\n                            10:01\r\n                            Our sun is just one of the dim stars in the universe, in our universe which is the Milky Way galaxy and\r\n                            10:10\r\n                            billions of galaxies like that. And yet, we cannot imagine how vast is the universe because until now there is no way\r\n                            10:21\r\n                            that we can even go to our closest neighboring star. And not to mention the neighboring galaxy.\r\n                            10:30\r\n                            Verse 4 says this perfectly, [67:4] Look again and again; your eyes will come back stumped and conquered. And that's, at least that's my impression when I look at the stars.\r\n                            10:40\r\n                            We also learn from verse 5 that the lowest universe, which is our universe, is adorned with lamps, which is stars.\r\n                            10:48\r\n                            This is... We know that lamp is the source of light. And we know that our sun is one of the stars.\r\n                            10:57\r\n                            So, what is implied here is probably that only our universe has stars.\r\n                            11:02\r\n                            So, we don't know how the outer universes, the second, the third universes look like.\r\n                            11:17\r\n                            We also learn from this Sura in verse 7, 8 and 9, how terrible is the condition in Hell.\r\n                            11:28\r\n                            We know that Hell is reserved only for those people who go out of their way to reject\r\n                            11:35\r\n                            or deny God's Greatness. And therefore, when people go there, people go there on their own volition because\r\n                            11:49\r\n                            despite of all these warnings that God sent through the messengers, through the scriptures, and through all the signs that God manifested to the people, they still insist on going\r\n                            11:59\r\n                            there. And therefore, it's like they already deserve what they get over there.\r\n                            12:04\r\n                            But God explains here how terrible is the condition in hell.\r\n                            12:10\r\n                            It is like, Hell has its own personality. I mean, Hell has its own, Hell can be so angry towards the disbelievers because when the disbelievers were sent there\r\n                            12:19\r\n                            group by group, Hell can even, you know, sort of talk back to them. \"Suffer. What do you do? Why did you...?\"\r\n                            12:26\r\n                            \"Can I have more?\" In some other verses in the Quran Hell says \"can I have more of these people?\" You know, because...\r\n                            12:32\r\n                            It's like, you know, a very, very savage beast. But Hell is simply the absence of God.\r\n                            12:38\r\n                            In other words, these people cannot stand to become close to God because they did not develop\r\n                            12:44\r\n                            their soul enough in this life. And therefore on the Day of Judgment, they have to run away from God.\r\n                            12:50\r\n                            They couldn't stand the presence of God. And that absence of God is really actually Hell.\r\n                            12:55\r\n                            Because in some of the verses in the Quran, we learn that Hell is also described by darkness, by hopelessness,\r\n                            13:03\r\n                            also fire where people are roasted there and never die. So, there is no excuse for the disbelievers when they go there because they have been warned here\r\n                            13:12\r\n                            as, with, you know, as best allegory as human language can find.\r\n                            13:19\r\n                            As a matter of fact, in verse 9, we know that disbelievers will, what is the word, they will accept the blame. This...\r\n                            13:32\r\n                            [67:9] ....\"Yes indeed; we had a warner, but we disbelieved and said, 'GOD did not reveal anything. You are totally astray.'\"\r\n                            13:39\r\n                            And this is exactly what majority of the people will say when one quotes, you know, from the scripture, you know,\r\n                            13:46\r\n                            one is conveying the word of God, they say \"we don't believe you. You are far off. You are strange.\"\r\n                            13:53\r\n                            So, that's what they say in this life and in the Hereafter, they will admit that.\r\n                            13:59\r\n                            And they also said in verse 10 \"if we heard or understood, we would not be among the dwellers of Hell.\"\r\n                            14:04\r\n                            Thus in verse 11, they actually confess their sins.\r\n                            14:11\r\n                            I think, if there's any questions or comments or anything, give it at the forum.\r\n                            14:37\r\n                            Gatut: Any comments or...? Dr. Khalifa: Any questions? Wait. As usual, I have a comment on (unintelligible) in the heaven or the sky.\r\n                            14:48\r\n                            We have here this list of Prayers, schedule for Prayers, an eternal schedule.\r\n                            14:56\r\n                            It is correct forever. You can see in the whole year, the sunrise and sunset, by the minute.\r\n                            15:05\r\n                            You could have extended it to the second and it would be exactly accurate. You look here at January 1st, the sunrise at a certain time, the sun will rise exactly at that time.\r\n                            15:15\r\n                            The sunset at that time, it will exactly be at that time. So, there is no flaw in God's system.\r\n                            15:21\r\n                            We know exactly when Halley's Comet is gonna come back. It comes every 76 years.\r\n                            15:29\r\n                            And sure enough, right on time, there it is coming, at that point in time. Even though Halley's Comet in an aberration. It looks like an aberration, though it's not. It is not\r\n                            15:41\r\n                            So, this is why God says in 4, [67:4] Look again and again; your eyes will come back stumped and conquered.\r\n                            15:46\r\n                            You are looking for a flaw. You will not find one. And we have a shared demonstration as to how the moon, we see only one side of the moon,\r\n                            15:59\r\n                            even though it is rotating around itself and around the earth, but this movement is synchronized\r\n                            16:04\r\n                            so precisely that if it is off by a fraction of a second, we would see the other side of the moon.\r\n                            16:11\r\n                            We look at poetry describing the moon that is thousands of years old, and they have been looking at the same side of the moon.\r\n                            16:21\r\n                            So, I just wanted to emphasize that because we have a demonstration right here. The flawless nature of God's creation.\r\n                            16:29\r\n                            So, these words of the Quran are flawless as well.\r\n                            16:39\r\n                            Back to Gatut. Gatut: Verse 12.\r\n                            16:45\r\n                            [67:12] As for those who reverence their Lord, when alone in their privacy, they have attained forgiveness and a great recompense.\r\n                            16:55\r\n                            Before we go to that page, I'll just comment here that it's very important that the belief has to be\r\n                            Fasting is a private form of worship. Anonymous Charity “believing in God privately”.\r\n                            17:02\r\n                            also subjected to the test of whether we are believing because of the crowd or whether we are believing because of our own conviction.\r\n                            17:10\r\n                            And majority of the people, if they say they believe, that is because usually this is the norm in the society.\r\n                            17:17\r\n                            In other words, if the norm in the society is that the people believe in God, if they don't believe in God, they say openly \"I don't believe in God\", then they're kind of like sore fingers sticking out.\r\n                            17:30\r\n                            So, they don't want to be in that position. They go along with the crowd even though, in their heart, they don't really believe.\r\n                            17:36\r\n                            And this is why the words \"when alone in their privacy\" is very important in my opinion because\r\n                            17:44\r\n                            even when the believer is by himself or by herself, he still observes God.\r\n                            17:50\r\n                            I mean, there's no difference whether he or she is in the group or by himself or herself.\r\n                            17:56\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: So, fasting is a good example of that because fasting is a strictly private (unintelligible). Gatut: Exactly.\r\n                            18:01\r\n                            You only... You have to be a believer in God, because you can drink or eat anywhere,\r\n                            18:09\r\n                            where nobody can see you, no human beings can see you, only God sees you. So, this is a good example.\r\n                            18:15\r\n                            Gatut: That reminds me of a story from some sister who said, when the husband is not there, you say \"well,\r\n                            18:23\r\n                            you can eat, you can drink, the husband is not here\", you know. But, you know, people who said that, seriously, they did not realize how deep, it's not just simply\r\n                            18:34\r\n                            something out of skin, it is something that the believer has the conviction in their heart. So,\r\n                            18:40\r\n                            it's not because of the husband or the wife or the parents or, you know, in-laws that we fast or that we observe God, that's because of our convictions.\r\n                            18:48\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: And when a need arises here in this community, the charity fund in the drawer.\r\n                            18:55\r\n                            The people are putting money there and they put this envelope and they write the name of the person that it goes to. And it's anonymous.\r\n                            19:03\r\n                            I try very hard to read the handwriting, but there is no way.\r\n                            19:08\r\n                            I have failed 100% of the time. But the person who's putting money in there anonymously, who sees this person?\r\n                            19:15\r\n                            There's a good number of believers here who believe in God in privacy, because what is the credit they are getting?\r\n                            19:23\r\n                            They know they're getting the credit from God. And we know that God writes in other verses in the Quran that if you give to charity publicly, it is good, but if you give it secretly, it's even better and remits more of your sins.\r\n                            19:36\r\n                            And obviously the people who are doing this, they know that this is the truth, they know that God will give them the credit.\r\n                            19:42\r\n                            There is no reason in the world for them to put money there, anonymously, except for knowing that God will give them... they get the credit from God.\r\n                            19:52\r\n                            So, this is a perfect example of this verse here, 12.\r\n                            19:57\r\n                            Mã Shã Allãh.\r\n                            20:04\r\n                            Gatut: [67:13] Whether you keep your utterances secret, or declare them, He is fully aware of the innermost thoughts.\r\n                            20:14\r\n                            [67:14] Should He not know what He created? He is the Sublime, Most Cognizant.\r\n                            20:21\r\n                            This is sort of a rhetorical question. God who created the heavens and the earth and everything in them. Of course, He knows what, you know, what,\r\n                            20:33\r\n                            everything that He created. He's fully aware of all the creation that He made.\r\n                            20:39\r\n                            I mean, in the Quran, there is even a verse that says \"not a single leaf falls without Him being knowing all that.\" So,\r\n                            20:50\r\n                            if we know, if we can count, if it is possible to count how many trees are there in the world and if it is possible to count how many leaves in every tree, which is impossible for any human being,\r\n                            21:01\r\n                            but God knows every single leaf that falls. That is how far, we cannot imagine how great is God.\r\n                            21:11\r\n                            So, we cannot even hide anything from God. You know, the children are usually very very, still very innocent.\r\n                            21:18\r\n                            And they used to be, you know, talk to them about, you know, God and...\r\n                            21:24\r\n                            The best way would be, in my experience, they can lie to you, but we told them that you cannot lie to God.\r\n                            21:30\r\n                            You can lie to your parents, you can lie, but God will always know. So, in the end, they are the ones who keep saying this all the time.\r\n                            21:39\r\n                            God always knows whether we declare anything or we keep it secret.\r\n                            21:46\r\n                            15. [67:15] He is the One who put the Earth at your service. Roam its corners, and eat from His provisions. To Him is the final summoning.\r\n                            21:56\r\n                            I just read the new translation of the Quran and one of the footnotes, in one of the footnotes, Rashad put\r\n                            22:07\r\n                            the analogy of this earth as a spaceship. So, when NASA launches any spaceship, you know, spaceship with two or three people aboard, they have to calculate\r\n                            22:19\r\n                            exactly how many they're gonna be there, so how much food, how much oxygen, how much water they need.\r\n                            22:24\r\n                            Yet these people are celebrities. These people came back from, you know, from space for a week or two months or whatever,\r\n                            22:31\r\n                            and they came back as celebrities and everybody knew them. You know, they are in the newspaper and everything.\r\n                            22:36\r\n                            Yet God sent us in this spaceship earth, and we are the ones who originally committed sin and, you know,\r\n                            22:45\r\n                            blasphemed against God because we were not sure of God's greatness. Yet God gave us this beautiful\r\n                            22:52\r\n                            spaceship earth with all kinds of provision, not only just food and drink, but also with fuels and all kinds of lakes, mountains, coasts, beaches and all that.\r\n                            23:05\r\n                            And this is because God is the Most Gracious. He's trying to give us a second chance and\r\n                            23:12\r\n                            we have to, you know, we have to...and we know from the scripture, from the Quran, that most people will fail to take the second chance.\r\n                            23:19\r\n                            But yet God gave that in advance and see whether, you know, whether we can appreciate that.\r\n                            23:24\r\n                            Sura... verse 15 says \"the earth is put for our service.\" Everything in this earth is actually put for our service.\r\n                            23:31\r\n                            The animals, the metals, the minerals, the fuel that we can get, anything that we have in this earth is actually created by God for our service.\r\n                            23:43\r\n                            Yet actually we are sinners in the beginning to start with.\r\n                            23:50\r\n                            So, this comparison makes me wonder if a little bit of room in the universe, I mean in the space\r\n                            24:00\r\n                            where these astronauts can climb through and make some celebrities, what about us?\r\n                            24:05\r\n                            God gives us all this for free and we actually are not even celebrities. We are, you know,...\r\n                            24:10\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: We don't have to wear space suits here. Gatut: Exactly. Dr. Khalifa: We can take a shower in space, too.\r\n                            24:25\r\n                            Gatut: Number sixteen, [67:16] Have you guaranteed that the One in heaven will not strike the earth and cause it to tumble?\r\n                            24:30\r\n                            [67:17] Have you guaranteed that the One in heaven will not send upon you a violent storm? Will you then appreciate the value of My warning?\r\n                            24:39\r\n                            [67:18] Others before them have disbelieved; how terrible was My requital!\r\n                            24:48\r\n                            We know that the earth is such an insignificant mote in God's universe and everything else that is\r\n                            25:00\r\n                            in the universe that God created actually fits the palm of God.\r\n                            25:06\r\n                            Everything, according to God, is in God's hands. So, when a human being looks at a mountain, it's a huge mountain, and they say \"this is...\r\n                            25:14\r\n                            \"there is no way that anybody can move this.\" But God says here that nobody can guarantee that nothing will happen to the earth.\r\n                            25:25\r\n                            It's very easy for God, if He wills, to strike the earth, wipe out all the disbelievers,\r\n                            25:32\r\n                            \"cause it to tumble\" according to this verse.\r\n                            25:39\r\n                            [67:17] Have you guaranteed that the One in heaven will not send upon you a violent storm? ... This is 17.\r\n                            25:44\r\n                            Until now, the weather prediction or weather forecast is still an art.\r\n                            25:50\r\n                            I met one guy who is finishing his PhD in this atmospheric science in the university,\r\n                            25:57\r\n                            and even he considers that weather forecast is still an art.\r\n                            26:02\r\n                            With all the supercomputers that they have, actually weather service is probably one of the biggest agencies that uses supercomputers.\r\n                            26:08\r\n                            They still cannot predict whether it's gonna be rain today or tomorrow in a localized area.\r\n                            26:13\r\n                            Not to mention the global weather pattern. It's still a very difficult subject to deal with.\r\n                            26:21\r\n                            And nobody can guarantee whether this place will get rain with certainty. They cannot, you know, we just...\r\n                            26:29\r\n                            All we need to do is just watch TV and see the weather forecast and how often they make mistakes.\r\n                            26:36\r\n                            So, God can very easily send a violent storm if He wants to.\r\n                            26:41\r\n                            If He decides that somebody needs to be shaken up in this area, then God sends a storm there.\r\n                            26:47\r\n                            Also, the storm actually will fertilize the soil. But all these are warnings, and we should be able to appreciate that.\r\n                            26:57\r\n                            And we learn from history, and the best history is actually the Quran. Because one of the chapters in the Quran is called history.\r\n                            27:03\r\n                            And God says in the Quran that the most important lesson in history, when we study or anybody studies history, is\r\n                            27:11\r\n                            that we know why these things are happening and how to avoid them. Now, we're...\r\n                            27:16\r\n                            We know consistently that anybody or any group or any society who oppose God and His messenger,\r\n                            27:21\r\n                            eventually will be wiped out and eventually will be defeated.\r\n                            27:27\r\n                            So, we know that this happens to the groups of people that came before us.\r\n                            27:32\r\n                            And all are recorded in this word of God that is, not only we know that it's truth, but we have the proof for it, which is the mathematical composition of it.\r\n                            27:43\r\n                            [67:19] Have they not seen the birds above them lined up in columns and spreading their wings? The Most Gracious is the One who holds them in the air. He is Seer of all things.\r\n                            27:57\r\n                            Here God is talking about the law of aerodynamics. We learn from the Khutba today, which is actually one of the, for those who missed the Khutba today,\r\n                            28:10\r\n                            the video program that will be shown starting tomorrow or next week, everywhere is\r\n                            28:17\r\n                            is a very good example of how a 20th century or 21st century human being can appreciate\r\n                            28:26\r\n                            the facts that have been expounded in a book written 1400 years ago.\r\n                            28:33\r\n                            All this detail about everything that only 50 to 100 years ago, some human beings started to learn\r\n                            28:40\r\n                            has been in the Quran for 1400 years. And here we know that, first of all, the birds fly because God decided\r\n                            28:51\r\n                            them to fly using the shape of the wings and the body. And this kind of shape and principle a human being start to learn and then\r\n                            28:59\r\n                            they copy it and they make aeroplanes, they make helicopters with the same principle. In other words, how this 100 tons 747, for instance, can take off into the air.\r\n                            29:10\r\n                            Simply because the shape of the wing is such that when you move the object, there will be less\r\n                            29:17\r\n                            density of the air on top of the wing than below the wing. So, the whole thing will be lifted.\r\n                            29:22\r\n                            So, that's the same design that God has made for the birds' wing. This is the principle of aerodynamics that is not considered well known, but yet all this has been around for millions of years.\r\n                            29:40\r\n                            [67:19] Have they not seen the birds above them lined up in columns and spreading their wings? ... We know that the formation the birds fly, again this is also a principle from aerodynamics.\r\n                            29:50\r\n                            The birds, God teaches the birds to fly in a certain pattern because certain pattern will be the most efficient to reduce the drag.\r\n                            29:58\r\n                            We know that the drag is the biggest challenge for anything that moves in the air. And this kind of formation is now actually being copied by, for instance, if you see Thunderbirds\r\n                            30:09\r\n                            F-16 from the Air Force. They always fly in a certain pattern because that pattern will reduce the drag that\r\n                            30:17\r\n                            each particular plane will experience. Most of us probably know this principle when we drive in the interstate.\r\n                            30:26\r\n                            If you drive 70 miles per hour and there's 18 wheelers 70 miles per hour in front of us, we tend to follow them. Because\r\n                            30:35\r\n                            we're basically having a reduced drag by following them and we can consume... we can conserve more fuel by driving that way.\r\n                            30:43\r\n                            So, that's also a principle of aerodynamics and it's also mentioned in the Quran here.\r\n                            30:51\r\n                            Number 20.

Dr. Khalifa: So, why don't you say what the Quran says? Hamid: It is not. Dr. Khalifa: So, you don't believe God then? Dr. Khalifa: You don't believe what God is saying. Hamid: I do believe God. Please don't put that things on me.\r\n                            32:12\r\n                            Hamid: I believe in God. Dr. Khalifa: Well, you're saying things that God doesn't say. Hamid: Every time I come to (unintelligible), you say \"then you don't believe.\" What... Dr. Khalifa: You don't believe God. God is saying in 65. Hamid: I do believe, sir.\r\n                            32:20\r\n                            Hamid: I'm telling you I do believe. I'm not lying to you. Dr. Khalifa: You believe Sura 65. Dr. Khalifa: that says if you believe in God, He makes things easy for you?\r\n                            32:26\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: You believe that? Hamid: Of course, He does. I do it. Hamid: I do things easy for me. I do things miserable for me. I have a capability.\r\n                            32:32\r\n                            I have a device. Hamid: I have a last testament. Dr. Khalifa: You made a statement now that things will not go easy for you.\r\n                            32:38\r\n                            Hamid: Of course, I can make things miserable for myself. Hamid: I have an ability. You are denying everything from me.\r\n                            32:45\r\n                            Hamid: And I'm telling you I am able... Dr. Khalifa: Well, that's arrogance. This is what arrogance is. Hamid: No. No, no, no. That is not arrogance. That's ignorance. I'm not ignorant. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. You cannot do anything to yourself.\r\n                            32:53\r\n                            Hamid: I'm telling you I can be... Hamid: See, you are very smart, very intelligent, more power to you. Hamid: But don't tell me... Well, if you say...\r\n                            33:02\r\n                            Hamid: If you make that big decision between Satan and God, the rest of it is easy. Dr. Khalifa: This is what God is saying. This is what God is saying, not me.\r\n                            33:08\r\n                            Hamid: I'm telling you the belief is a revolving door. Dr. Khalifa: Do you believe God or not? Dr. Khalifa: Do you believe God? Ok. Hamid: It's a revolving door. Dr. Khalifa: Do you believe God or not? Hamid: Yes, I do.\r\n                            33:14\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: If you believe God, then you are wrong. Because God says if you make the decision to be with God, things will be easy for you.\r\n                            33:20\r\n                            And the rest will follow. Hamid: You know why? You know why? Dr. Khalifa: I can show it to you in the Bible. I can show it to you in the Quran. Hamid: Because as a concept, it's true.\r\n                            33:27\r\n                            Hamid: The concept is true. Dr. Khalifa: Ok. Hamid: God is Almighty. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Hamid: As I was, as I was telling these gentleman, and this, Dr. Khalifa: Ok. Now, we're talking.\r\n                            33:35\r\n                            Hamid: When you...when... Let's take it one enterprise as an example.\r\n                            33:40\r\n                            Hamid: Let's take one enterprise. You go to one big company and you are hired. Under circumstances, under particular circumstances, you are qualified for that job.\r\n                            33:50\r\n                            But if you don't fulfill that expectation, which I put it to you at the first, at the beginning,\r\n                            33:57\r\n                            you are fired, you are failed, and they very graciously will tell you \"go somewhere else.\r\n                            34:06\r\n                            This is what we know what is expected from us. God is not going to interfere. It's not fair.\r\n                            34:13\r\n                            He is not gonna interfere. If I pull a gun on you and say \"I'm gonna kill you\", He's not gonna interfere in that.\r\n                            34:19\r\n                            Hamid: If otherwise you pull a gun on me, He is not going to interfere. Dr. Khalifa: You're wrong. You're wrong. (unintelligible) What Mahmoud says? Mahmoud.\r\n                            34:26\r\n                            Mahmoud: Well, at least this argument is something that in the last (unintelligible).\r\n                            34:34\r\n                            But one thing that I wanna ask you is, one thing that you refer to, and that's the fact that\r\n                            34:42\r\n                            we know a lot of things about the Quran, about Islam, from hearing them, not\r\n                            34:50\r\n                            referencing them directly to the Quran. What I'd like you to say is, whatever you're saying is the belief, to back it up with the Quranic verses.\r\n                            35:01\r\n                            Because we are, as you said, we are talking to someone who is intelligent, who is smart, and he knows Quran.\r\n                            35:08\r\n                            So, if you wanna argue, or you wanna prove your point, at least I as a listener here,\r\n                            35:14\r\n                            I wanna see your support, your reference. If you say it on the basis of the things that you have heard, and you believe it,\r\n                            35:24\r\n                            without any reference to the Quran, then I have a hard time to believe it, to understand what you say or accept it, as a third party listening to both of you.\r\n                            35:34\r\n                            No matter whether I believe what he's saying, or what you say is true. If you wanna make the argument, and let it stay, at least make things clear for me,\r\n                            35:43\r\n                            or for other people who are sitting here, and things are not clear. I expect you...\r\n                            35:49\r\n                            Hamid: to back it up? Mahmoud: back it up with verses. Hamid: I'm sorry, I can't do it. Hamid: I cannot even get close to his knowledge, his Quranic knowledge.\r\n                            35:56\r\n                            But I am talking from common sense. Dr. Khalifa: No, no. (unintelligible) Mahmoud: That's... that is why\r\n                            36:03\r\n                            Mahmoud: One more minute Mahmoud: That is why I found out when I came in here. A lot of things that I thought was common sense,\r\n                            36:09\r\n                            because I'm someone who do science, I always tried to refer everything to some\r\n                            36:14\r\n                            very strong reference, and this is the Word of God. So, if you believe in that, then we may have the common ground that this is the Word of God.\r\n                            36:23\r\n                            I do believe in God, as everybody else does, but the difference is interpretation. And we have, as I've been and I do, a lot of bad things in the system, a lot of things that are hearsay,\r\n                            36:35\r\n                            a lot of things that we have learned has gone to our system, and a lot of intellectual and radical interpretations, which is fine as social and economic issues.\r\n                            36:46\r\n                            That's fine, but if I can't back it up with Quranic verses then I'm not gonna get in my heart. At least...\r\n                            36:54\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: The other side of the coin is, if I cannot back it up, and I see something in the Quran, I have to submit to it.\r\n                            37:00\r\n                            You see, we're assuming that all these people here believe that the Quran is the truth. Once I show you something in the Quran, I expect you to say \"this is what God says, I accept it.\"\r\n                            37:10\r\n                            So, if you read Sura 65, verses 3, 4, and 5, and 6, it tells you that if you believe in God, things will be easy for you.\r\n                            37:18\r\n                            God will provide for you whence you never expect. If you read the Bible, it will tell you \"seek God's Kingship over you, and everything else follows.\"\r\n                            37:27\r\n                            And there are many, many verses I can show you in the Quran, but if you follow common sense and logic, it doesn't work.\r\n                            37:34\r\n                            Robert? Robert: We discuss this, because, like you said, it's hard, especially, I don't know, the way I grew up,\r\n                            37:42\r\n                            you learn, you always think you take responsibility for yourself and all these things,\r\n                            37:47\r\n                            but in terms of, you're talking about the one big decision, I had a problem with that, because I saw one big decision. Well,\r\n                            37:54\r\n                            how do you know when you make one big decision, that you choose this or that? Because lots of times,\r\n                            37:59\r\n                            you know, you say, \"okay, yes, I believe in God\", but a second later, you're doing something that is contrary to, you know, Quranic law, or something of that nature.\r\n                            38:12\r\n                            When you make a big decision, you're creating a covenant with God, and you have to uphold,\r\n                            38:19\r\n                            you know, when you choose God, you're choosing, you're not just saying \"well, okay, I choose God, everything else is gonna follow, because God is gonna control it, so then I don't have to get up and pray, I don't have to do nothing, because, you know, I choose God.\"\r\n                            38:31\r\n                            Robert: But when you choose God, you're choosing to be righteous. Hamid: Consequences. Hamid: There is a consequence. Robert: It's a system. You're creating a covenant with God.\r\n                            38:37\r\n                            Robert: And all these things that the Quran says for you is to prove to yourself that God is controlling,\r\n                            38:44\r\n                            controlling everything, that you're on the path to God, like praying and all these things. These are things for us to prove to ourselves that we have made the right decision.\r\n                            38:53\r\n                            And that... Because God controls the people who choose to go the other direction, too.\r\n                            38:59\r\n                            He says \"if you choose to go on Satan's path\", He pushes you that way. He controls everything.\r\n                            39:04\r\n                            So, all these things, like studying, for example, which is totally irrelevant, well, God will provide for us to do certain things. He controls all matters.\r\n                            39:16\r\n                            And like what Gatut was saying earlier about studying and not having to\r\n                            39:25\r\n                            worry, he was saying strictly that \"you don't have to worry when an exam comes\", not necessarily you don't have to prepare, because God will control that, God will prepare you.\r\n                            39:35\r\n                            You know, God will make sure that you get something done. Like you said \"God instills in you the desire to study\", so that you are prepared. You don't have to worry about it.\r\n                            39:44\r\n                            God will provide for you. God controls all these things on the basis of your covenant with Him.\r\n                            39:50\r\n                            Hamid: Because it is the nature of human being. I was just saying, it's a peace of mind. If you are worrisome and in disarray, you cannot achieve much.\r\n                            39:58\r\n                            You can go and stay in a library for hours and hours, but your mind is somewhere else.\r\n                            40:04\r\n                            But if you have that mind, that peace of mind, then you can achieve it. Robert: God, God... Hamid: So, that is...\r\n                            40:12\r\n                            Hamid: I agree with you. He is Almighty. But He is not gonna interfere in daily basis. Dr. Khalifa: Yes, yes Robert: He controls everything, everything. A man: Yes.\r\n                            40:20\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Even the words you are saying. Dr. Khalifa: Ali. W. are running out of time.\r\n                            40:28\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Thank God He interferes. He does everything in this world. Ali: When I was back in Iran, and my dad sat on the campus (unintelligible).\r\n                            40:38\r\n                            And I was always warned to believe in God and stuff like that. And at school, they made us pray. They made sure we prayed.\r\n                            40:45\r\n                            And I always went to it and sometimes, you know, I would just volunteer and try to lead it.\r\n                            40:51\r\n                            And there is a part of the Prayer in Iran where you put your hands up like this and you say some things about Ali or Muhammad.\r\n                            40:59\r\n                            I always forgot things. I could never remember. Dr. Khalifa: Yeah.\r\n                            “God is doing everything”.\r\n                            41:05\r\n                            Ali: I would always skip it. I would remember everything else, but I would skip that. I don't know why.\r\n                            41:10\r\n                            I would try to remember. I would tell myself, try to remember in the beginning, but I would just skip it. You know, unless somebody else was leading.\r\n                            41:17\r\n                            But I would go down and I would do the thing and if my friend was there or somebody, he would say it loudly, so I would do it.\r\n                            41:23\r\n                            But I always skipped it. And I always... Hamid: But if you forget it, there is no credit. But if you did it consciously, then there is some credit.\r\n                            41:31\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No,... A man: No, no, no. Dr. Khalifa: God says it in the Quran. A man: No, no, you do it in your Prayers so many times. Hamid: But God told him to forget it? Dr. Khalifa: Absolutely. A woman: Yes.\r\n                            41:39\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: See, the words you are saying now. Dr. Khalifa: It is not even funny. God is doing everything. It's not even funny.\r\n                            41:44\r\n                            Even the words you're uttering, the encounters you have every day. Ali: Right and right now, I'm going... you know, right now, I mean, school and stuff, I am running for my class presidency.\r\n                            41:58\r\n                            Right now, there are a lot of people more popular than me and stuff. I'm not worried because I know God is on my side, but it doesn't mean that I'm not gonna work hard.\r\n                            42:06\r\n                            I've been working hard. I'm trying to get posters out. I'm working really hard on my speech. But if I know that God is on my side, I'm not worried.\r\n                            42:12\r\n                            I know that I can win if I work hard with Him on my side. But God will provide the stuff for me, the slogans, how the speech will come.\r\n                            42:22\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Mã Shã Allãh. A woman: And how does... Dr. Khalifa: Douglas. Dr. Khalifa: Douglas. Douglas: One of the things we find in the Quran is God says \"those who believe and work righteousness.\" And that's the sequence.\r\n                            42:35\r\n                            You cannot work righteousness unless you believe. A person can think they believe.\r\n                            42:41\r\n                            The Quran says \"have you not seen those who follow their own opinions?\" The Quran speaks of human beings who think they have guidance, who think they have knowledge, when in fact they don't.\r\n                            42:52\r\n                            And all of us have at one time or another felt we know something or we know what to do in a situation.\r\n                            42:58\r\n                            That sequence throughout the Quran \"those who believe and work righteousness\",\r\n                            43:04\r\n                            one of the things that it points out is that it is Allah's will, it is God's will that we work the righteousness,\r\n                            43:12\r\n                            that He guides us to work the righteousness. We cannot do it on our own.\r\n                            43:18\r\n                            So, to use the example of studying for the exam, a person who truly believes knows what God says in the Quran,\r\n                            43:26\r\n                            that you must be responsible for your own actions in that sense and they will take that step.\r\n                            43:34\r\n                            So, that sequence is very crucial, \"those who believe and work righteousness.\"\r\n                            43:39\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Chester. Jester: Also in the Quran, it says that God tests you daily and every time that you say something, you can make things go miserable for you.\r\n                            43:48\r\n                            Isn't that also a test, you know? And when you're miserable, isn't that kind of a failed test? Because you would be happy if you didn't and if you listen, you believe in God because He makes things easier.\r\n                            43:58\r\n                            I mean, God will give me (unintelligible), he just gave me a job today by having a (unintelligible).\r\n                            Follower argues regarding Rapes, child abuse, etc….”rapes happen in Satan’s kingdoms”.\r\n                            44:03\r\n                            I've just been accepting things as they come along lately and things have become a lot easier. I've argued things and already I've been arguing with God, (unintelligible).\r\n                            44:16\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Fantastic, Jester. Mã Shã Allãh. Hamid: I agree basically with what they say.\r\n                            44:23\r\n                            Hamid: There are some rapes. There are some child abuse. God is not going to interfere.\r\n                            44:29\r\n                            Hamid: The guy who abuses, the guy who misleads, the guy who represents himself... Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible).\r\n                            44:35\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Something is missing here. Hamid: had to, has to... Dr. Khalifa: The rapes, the rapes and ones who does all this are in Satan's world, not in God's world. Hamid: The last... The last revelation is here\r\n                            44:44\r\n                            Hamid: and it says you have to pay the consequences. Hamid: It's here. He's not gonna come down or whatever, the jinn or whatever, is not gonna come and\r\n                            44:54\r\n                            hold my hand and say \"hey, not to steal things.\" I'm going to steal it if I decide, if I choose to be a thief, then I have to pay the price.\r\n                            45:04\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: You're making a decision to break God's law. You're making a decision to be in Satan's kingdom. Hamid: That's exactly what I'm saying. Hamid: I'm saying if the speaker is bad, I have to either hire someone to fix it in advance\r\n                            45:14\r\n                            Hamid: because I have it up here, I know it's not working. Dr. Khalifa: No, no, no, angels... No. Dr. Khalifa: God will send His angels to fix your stomach or your heart or your car or your speakers.\r\n                            45:23\r\n                            Hamid: And the wife. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Hussein: I have a question about verse 20, Gatut please. Going back to verse 20 of Sura 67, page 563. It's about the invisible soldier that you mentioned\r\n                            45:42\r\n                            the jinns or the angels, when the people were fighting the believers,\r\n                            45:50\r\n                            or the disbelievers were fighting the believers, even when the number of believers,\r\n                            45:56\r\n                            maybe, you know, ten, hundred times higher than the soldiers, the disbelievers were mostly (unintelligible).\r\n                            46:06\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: The believers always win. The believers always win. Hussein: Yeah, that's right. The believers always win. Dr. Khalifa: Yep. Hussein: And you mentioned about the invisible soldiers.\r\n                            46:12\r\n                            Does this mean that we do not see the invisible soldiers and they do not exist physically\r\n                            46:20\r\n                            or do they take the gun and they shoot? Or this invisible soldier, what God meant was, again, that sacrifice, determination, hard fighting, not be afraid of anything, just in the front line?\r\n                            46:36\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: No, Hussein, they are mentioned in the Quran several times. Invisible soldiers means soldiers you cannot see.\r\n                            46:41\r\n                            They are right in this room, but you cannot see them. Hussein: But how do they fight? Dr. Khalifa: They are very physical. Because they can carry this mosque and turn it upside down. How physical can you get?\r\n                            46:50\r\n                            Hamid: They have never done it anywhere in the whole universe. Dr. Khalifa: They didn't do it to us. Hamid: You are putting a question, God can destroy this, but has He ever done it? Dr. Khalifa: Sodom and Gomorrah.\r\n                            46:57\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Of course. Sodom and Gomorrah. Hamid: Not after the last revelation, because He just said, this is it. Dr. Khalifa: It's in the Quran. Hamid, Hamid, Hamid\r\n                            47:02\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Read my lips. Read my lips. The angels turned Sodom upside down, the city. Hamid: Yeah, did I just tell you after the Prophet Muhammad, he said \"this is it\"?\r\n                            47:10\r\n                            Now you have everything in your hand? Hamid: Before that, people asked Dr. Khalifa: I don't understand. Prophets \"we want some proof\", like a miracle. And Moses threw his Dr. Khalifa: Yes.\r\n                            47:20\r\n                            Hamid: stick and became a whatever, and open... Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Hamid: because people were not sophisticated, they were not at a higher echelon.\r\n                            47:27\r\n                            Hamid: Now, we are, we are in an enlightenment era. Dr. Khalifa: We never (unintelligible) right now.\r\n                            47:33\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Hamid: The whole... Dr. Khalifa: So, what is your point? Hamid: If you're not getting it, I'm sorry. I'm saying this is it.\r\n                            47:39\r\n                            Dr. Khalifa: If that's what you're saying, you're not following it. Hamid: He said \"the consequences... Hamid: (unintelligible) if you make that big decision, God will come and turn the TV for me, if I say \"well, listen, my legs are broken.\" Dr. Khalifa: You don't believe it.\r\n                            47:49\r\n                            Hamid: And this guy says \"well, go and get a (unintelligible)... Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: If you believe in God, (unintelligible) Hamid: I do believe in God, sir.\r\n                            47:55\r\n                            (unintelligible) Hamid: But I also believe in my intelligence.\r\n                            48:01\r\n                            Gatut: See, the Quran says, the Quran says that we have to kill our ego, because that is usually the last idol. Dr. Khalifa: Our teacher... Go ahead.\r\n                            48:08\r\n                            Hamid: What that has to do with the price of tea in China? Gatut: I am saying that. Hamid: I'm talking about my...\r\n                            48:14\r\n                            Hamid: Did I talk... I said \"please believe in yourself, God will guide you.\" Gatut: No.\r\n                            48:19\r\n                            Gatut: Believe in God, not believe in yourself. You believe in God. Hamid: Your ability to, God put it in you, you supposedly... Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible)\r\n                            48:27\r\n                            Gatut: See, Moses was commanded by God to tell his people to kill their ego, because the ego is the last idol.\r\n                            48:33\r\n                            We can say we believe in God. Millions of people who believe in God will not make it. Because they still have something hanging, the stumbling block, and the last stumbling block is the ego.\r\n                            48:43\r\n                            Gatut: If we cannot accept the word of God as it says in the Quran, .... Hamid: Everything you do consciously, it will count, Hamid: good or bad, it will count against, for you or against you.\r\n                            48:51\r\n                            Hamid: It will credit it in you and nothing to your neighbor, not your brother or father. Hamid: It's your own account.\r\n                            48:56\r\n                            Hamid: But, if you don't do it unconsciously, there is no credit. Hamid: If I Pray, if I'm a good Muslim, because my father told me so, there is no credit for me.\r\n                            49:06\r\n                            But if I come to the senses that there is such a religion and tells you this, and...\r\n                            49:11\r\n                            and I come to the decision, and got to the point, then there is some credit at the end of the line.\r\n                            49:19\r\n                            Hamid: But you have to make a decision, it's a revolving door. It's a revolving door. Robert: In the Quran, God says \"He misguides those who He pleases and guides those who He pleases.\r\n                            49:30\r\n                            So, then on the consequence of what you just said, your own common sense, if God guides who He pleases\r\n                            49:35\r\n                            and misguides who He pleases, that's in the Quran. Hamid: Right. Robert: Is that correct? Hamid: That's absolutely correct. Robert: So,...\r\n                            49:43\r\n                            Hamid: Not in daily basis... Robert: So then, you can throw conscious and common sense right out the window, in a sense.\r\n                            49:48\r\n                            Robert: Now, except the fact that everything in the Quran and everything does make sense. That's how God has made it for us.\r\n                            49:57\r\n                            The whole fact that we don't believe that God had His only begotten son and sent Him onto this earth, all these\r\n                            “You do not test God”.\r\n                            50:04\r\n                            things that don't make sense, three people in one, and all this other stuff, that we just believe in God alone. That's all part of common sense.\r\n                            50:12\r\n                            The fact that there are no contradictions in the Quran with science, that it is a perfect book.\r\n                            50:18\r\n                            I mean, this is all part of common sense. But when you're talking about, like, one big decision, it's whole bunches of decisions, little decisions,\r\n                            50:25\r\n                            which constitute one big decision, whether you believe in God or not. That's what I was talking about \"the covenant\", with your covenant with God.\r\n                            50:32\r\n                            Like when you're talking about praying or not praying, that's a decision whether you're choosing God or Satan. That's all part of that one big decision.\r\n                            50:39\r\n                            So, it comes up time and time and time again. But that's the only thing that matters. Whether you tell your employees \"look, here, this has to be done in one month or not\", and\r\n                            50:50\r\n                            they get kicked out, I mean, that doesn't make any difference. Hamid: See, God is fair and just. Robert: He controls all that. Hamid: If you are fool enough to go on the roof and then fall down, He's not gonna do anything. He's not gonna interfere.\r\n                            51:02\r\n                            Hamid: If I survive, if I survive, if I survive, if I survive the accident, there is some explanations, physical explanations.\r\n                            51:11\r\n                            Hamid: It's not that God's test. Robert: There is no need to test God.
