But the soul uses this physical body to grow, this wild horse. As you do more important things, other things are pushed away out of your memory.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">26:55</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">But actually, they never go away. You know of the subconcious. It goes into a storage, like the tapes that Lisa plays back and forth. It&#39;s that storage, memory.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">27:15</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">But you know, really we were just one cell. Each of us was one cell and differentiated,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">27:21</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">divided and differentiated into kidneys and livers, hearts, lungs. One cell, nose, eyes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">27:34</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Look at the eyes, how the eyes move. Such sleepy eyes.

A woman: Do you have something about memory storage, you know, to the beginning of life? Because I do remember</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">28:28</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">The messenger: It&#39;s all there.

Actually, it&#39;s out there in the atmosphere, every voice, every picture.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">28:47</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">A woman: And the angels have the recordings. And I always thought the angels were being turned to my body, but then I realized it was because my heart pumps, when all those things happen, by the will of God, the angels must be involved in it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">29:13</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">The messenger: No, it&#39;s a mechanism. I couldn&#39;t turn the car engine on, if there is no engine here. There&#39;s a mechanism. There is a gas that the fuel pump.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">29:29</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">The messenger: Yes. As a matter of fact, when our cars break down, when the mechanism fails, then God provides another mechanism, which is your engine.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">29:37</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">But there is a mechanism, when the starter works, when the fuel pump pumps fuel,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">29:45</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">when the pistons spark, when fire... there&#39;s something.

A woman: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">30:17</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">The messenger: Our heart is an incredible pump.

They are happy about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">30:42</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">If you take the heart by itself, you can have it work properly. In fact, heart transplant doctors could do that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">30:48</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">(Unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">when the Miracle is presented &ndash; why do people not respond. Miracle of the word GOD explained.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">31:01</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">10, 15 college students came here and Edip spoke to them from, from Pima College &nbsp;and he explained to them the miracle,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">31:16</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">that there&#39;s a message from God to the world and gave them all &nbsp;the details they wanted about an hour and a half,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">31:25</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">wanted them to ask questions and he told them &quot;we have &nbsp;a Quranic study tonight. So, would you... if you have &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">31:35</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">any questions, you can come and discuss the matter &nbsp;further, but they never showed up, not but one. Not one of them</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">31:41</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">showed up. We have high school kids. He presents the miracle to them give them details, but there is no &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">31:49</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">response. And we&#39;re just wondering what is wrong with the &nbsp;people. Here&#39;s a message from God, proven to &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">31:56</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">be from God, it tells us who we are, why we&#39;re here, &nbsp;where we&#39;re going and how to attain perfect happiness &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">32:04</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">now and forever, but they&#39;re just like... they&#39;re &nbsp;under hypnosis. Nothing moves them and we&#39;re just &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">32:14</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">wandering. It&#39;s a kind of amazing phenomenon. So, &nbsp;we&#39;re working on, on simplifying this and working &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">32:23</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">on ways and means of perfecting the message and &nbsp;how to present it to the people to motivate them,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">32:31</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">make them realize that there is a message from God, &nbsp;the first physical evidence in history, and all the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">32:40</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">benefits that follow from this. So, I&#39;m going to &nbsp;share with you these simple but powerful facts. </span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">32:49</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">They&#39;re very simple to understand, simple to present and simple &nbsp;to appreciate. And hopefully this, we will perfect the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">32:56</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">message somehow. So, what I&#39;m going to talk with &nbsp;you today is just the word &quot;God&quot; in the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">33:05</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">It&#39;s a very simple, very simple matter. There&#39;s a scripture &nbsp;from God. The most important word in it is the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">33:14</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">word &quot;God.&quot; I&#39;m gonna look just at that which is only one millionth of the total miracle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">33:22</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">OK. Number one: the occurrence of the word &quot;God&quot; in the whole book. All of you know this. 2 6 9 8.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">33:36</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">19 x 142. Ok. Then, you take every verse in the Quran &nbsp;wherever you see the word &quot;God&quot;, it is very simple &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">33:51</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">as you see, and add the numbers of these verses, ok, all the verses in the Quran that have the word &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">34:07</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">&quot;God&quot; in them, just add their numbers. They give you &nbsp;1 1 8 1 2 3.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">34:17</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">19 x 6217. You know, this alone really, this alone tells us &nbsp;that this book is from God. It is not human-made.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">34:30</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Who designed this? And I have gone through length &nbsp;to show you how we, college graduates, are unable &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">34:41</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">to keep track of these. I mean, the message is &nbsp;already here, it&#39;s already written down. It&#39;s in front of</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">34:46</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">us but we&#39;re having a heck of a time keeping &nbsp;track of the words and the sentences. And we keep &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">34:56</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">screening mistakes. It&#39;s very simple. &nbsp;Sometimes we just reverse 3 2, make it &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">35:01</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">23, when we count or when we add. But &nbsp;this alone proves that the book is from God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">35:15</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">OK. Next. This is a new discovery by Muhammad &nbsp;Abib. Now that we see there&#39;s 19 as a common &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">35:28</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">denominator, he looked at all the verses in the &nbsp;Quran that are number 19 or multiples of 19 and &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">35:38</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">counted the word &quot;God&quot; in them. Very simple process. &nbsp;These are the 19 multiples verses. So, it&#39;s in Sura Al-Baqarah, number 2</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">35:55</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">looks at verse number 19 and counts the number of the word &quot;God&quot; in it. &nbsp; Then, goes to verse number 38, number 57 and so on. And &nbsp;he did this in the whole Quran. Now, the word &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">36:06</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">&quot;God&quot; in those verses 133. Nobody in the &nbsp;whole world knows except the believers, know this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">36:23</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">This is a new discovery. It&#39;s been already faxed &nbsp;to India, Canada and some other places. As soon &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">36:30</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">as these things come up, we have a fax machine now, and it&#39;s... everything is faxed around the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">36:37</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">But anyway so, now, we carry this miracle one &nbsp;step further and it shows the more intricacy</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">36:46</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">of the miracle. It should convince anybody that we &nbsp;have a book from God. But the word &quot;God&quot; is very &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">36:55</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">important. So, it doesn&#39;t stop here. The next item, the sum of all the occurrences of the word &quot;God&quot; in &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">37:05</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">the verses whose numbers are not multiples of 19, it follows. 19, not multiple verses,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">37:20</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">and it only follows from that. It&#39;s 1 1 7 9 9 0. Yes. This is a mathematical property, says Edip. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">37:36</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Even though it is a mathematical property, &nbsp;I was... I was oblivious to it for a while, then I said &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">37:41</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">&quot;yeah, since the verses that are multiples of 19 &nbsp;have a multiple of 19 number words of &quot;God&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">37:47</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">then it follows, you just subtract this from this and you have that. But it still is an important fact for us &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">37:54</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">to remember even though it is a mathematical &nbsp;property. It doesn&#39;t stop here. The Suras</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">38:02</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">whose number of verses is divisible by 19, this also is a new discovery by Muhammad Abib, the Suras whose</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">38:09</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">number of verses is divisible by 19, that &nbsp;is any Sura that has 19 verses or 38 verses,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">38:15</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">the only these 2 kinds. There are Sura&#39;s number 47 &nbsp;which has 38 verses, Sura 82 which has 19 verses &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">38:23</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Sura 87, 19 verses and Sura 96 consists &nbsp;of 19 verses. The word &quot;God&quot; occurs in these &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">38:30</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Suras 27 times, one time, one time and one time, &nbsp;respectively. By adding these Sura numbers plus &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">38:39</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">the occurrence of the word &quot;God&quot;, the total is 342. So, Suras, &nbsp;first occurrences 342, 19 x 18.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">39:03</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">These are all the Suras in the Quran that &nbsp;consist of a number of verses that is divisible by 19, and again we are counting the word &quot;God&quot; in them. The next item,... take care to erase number 1 here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">39:26</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">It&#39;s just the word &quot;God.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">39:31</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Number 6. Ok. The first set of Quranic &nbsp;initials is, as you know, A.L.M. in chapter 2,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">39:40</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">we get to A.L.M. The last initial is &nbsp;in chapter 68. It&#39;s a natural &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">39:47</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">division in the Quran. Let&#39;s call this the &nbsp;initialed section from Sura 2 to Sura 68, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">39:54</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">and count the word &quot;God&quot; in it. Sure enough, it&#39;s a multiple of 19. Initialed section from the first &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">40:02</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">initialed Sura to the last initialed Sura. The &nbsp;number of the word &quot;God&quot; is 2 6 4 1, (19 x) 139.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">40:25</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Now, these are physical facts. It is nobody&#39;s &nbsp;opinion. Nobody can say &quot;in my opinion, the number</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">40:33</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">the number of occurrences of the word &quot;God&quot; in the initiated section of the Quran is &nbsp; 2641.&quot; Nobody can say that. It&#39;s a physical &nbsp;fact just like the sun rises from the east. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">40:45</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Nobody can argue about it. Maybe, the Arabs do. It follows since the total in the whole Quran is &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">41:00</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">a multiple of 19, it follows that outside &nbsp;the initialed section, the number of occurrences</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">41:06</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">of the word &quot;God&quot; is 57, 19 times 3. Not only that, you take those 57 occurrences outside the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">41:14</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">initialed section, add the Suras and verses, the total, yes, it&#39;s a multiple of 19.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">41:27</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">And now we have interlocking the word &quot;God&quot; with &nbsp;the last two sentences in Sura 9. As you know,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">41:35</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">they are fake. The idol worshipers were trying to honor the prophet Muhammad in the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">41:45</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">same way as the Christians try to honor Jesus. They made up those two verses. So, Sura 9 is either &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">41:59</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">129 verses, as we inherited from &nbsp;the fabricators. Or now, we know it is 127.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">42:10</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Which one is it? The word &quot;God&quot; gives us a clue. Because if &nbsp;you take all the Suras whose number of verses ends &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">42:22</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">with the digit 9, just look at the whole Quran &nbsp;and take all the Suras where the number of &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">42:33</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">verses end with this digit, 9, and count the word &quot;God&quot; in them, without Sura 9. Let us assume</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">42:41</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">that the right number is 127. Well, you can include it if &nbsp;you want, but if you include Sura 9 in the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">42:49</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">in this group, the number of the word &quot;God&quot; is not &nbsp;divisible which tells us this is the wrong number &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">42:56</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">of verses. If you put 127, it is divisible. Let &nbsp;me, let me... it&#39;s stronger than that. The Suras that &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">43:09</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">end with the digit 9 are Suras number 10, 15, 29, 43, 44, 48, 52, 57, 81, 82, 87, 96 and 104.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">43:21</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">They consist of 109 verses, 99 verses 69, 89, 59, 29, 49, 29, &nbsp;29, 19, 19, 19 and 9. So, you can see that all of them &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">43:34</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">have a number of verses that ends with the digit &nbsp;9. When you count the word &quot;God&quot; in these, you have 190.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">43:45</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">19 x 10. Now look in the Quran and take all the Suras in the Quran &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">43:52</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">whose number of verses ends with the digit 7, &nbsp;including Sura 9, and these of Sura&#39;s numbers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">44:03</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Sura number 1 is 7 verses, as you know. 1, 9, which is 127, 25, 26, 45, 86, and 107. Their number of verses are 7, 127, 77,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">44:17</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">227, 37, 17, and 107. You count the word &quot;God&quot; in &nbsp;them and you get 209. This is 19 x 10.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">44:35</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">This is 19 x 11. So, the word &quot;God&quot; just &nbsp;like the mathematical code guards, protects</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">44:46</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">the Quran from any distortion. The word &quot;God&quot; &nbsp;by itself does that because it tells you that</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">44:54</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Sura 9 consists of 127 verses, not &nbsp;129. Because if you take what we inherited</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">45:00</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">from the fabricators, this, this phenomenon will &nbsp;disappear. Yes, both of them will disappear.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">45:13</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">The number of occurrences of the word &quot;God&quot; from the &nbsp;beginning of the Quran to the end of Sura 9,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">45:22</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">from the first verse in Sura 1 to the last &nbsp;verse of Sura 9 which is 127, the occurrences</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">45:32</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">of the word &quot;God&quot; is 1 2 7 3. This is very unusual &nbsp;because this is not true of every Sura in the Quran &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">45:47</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">but God saw to it that at the end of Sura, verse 127 of Sura 9, the total occurrences of word &quot;God&quot; is a</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">45:56</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">multiple of 19. Ismail Barakat: Not only that, but it is also 127. The messenger: Yes. 1 2 7 3. So, if</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">46:07</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">we take the 129 verses that we inherited &nbsp;from the falsifiers, you&#39;ll have 1 2 7 4,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">46:14</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">not a multiple of 19. Finally... &nbsp;the only one... one word &quot;God&quot; in the last 2 verses, right?</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">46:29</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Yeah, the last item here, add the number of &nbsp;Sura 9, oh yeah, let&#39;s add the number of Sura 9</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">46:48</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">plus the number, the correct number of verses 127 plus the number of occurrences of the word &quot;God&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">46:59</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">168, the total is 304. 19 x 16. This is just &nbsp;the word &quot;God.&quot; And there are, of course, many other</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">47:14</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">crucial words like the word &quot;Rasool&quot;, the word &nbsp;&quot;Quran&quot;, the word &quot;one.&quot; It just goes on and on, but this &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">47:23</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">is just the word &quot;God.&quot; And when I simplify... Abdullah? Did you &nbsp;just discover that? You discovered it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">47:33</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Where else will you have miracles (unintelligible) on you? Ok. Abdullah, what is it? M&atilde; Sh&atilde; All&atilde;h</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">47:41</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Abdullah: There are 85 chapters that have the word &quot;God&quot; in it. And if you take chapter number, no, no, no, don&#39;t add that... chapter number</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">47:56</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">and the last verse that &quot;God&quot; occurs, for each chapters, add &nbsp;them up. Divisible. </span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">48:04</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">The messenger: Is that the same one that we have in appendix or different? Ok. Abdullah: For example, chapter, chapter 1, the last word that &quot;God&quot; occurs is number 2.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">48:14</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">The messenger: Yes. Abdullah: So, 1 plus 2 is 3. If you take chapter 9, the last verse is 127 not 129.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">48:22</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">The messenger: Right. Abdullah: You have 9 plus 127. And that&#39;s for all 85 chapters. The messenger: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">48:28</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Abdullah: I think the result is 9101. I&#39;m not sure but it&#39;s divisible by 19. The messenger: Yes. 9101 is divisible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">48:39</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">The messenger: OK. I&#39;m gonna repeat just in case you, you missed it. The word &quot;God&quot; occurs... this is very... this is a good one, beautiful.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">48:49</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">The word &quot;God&quot; occurs in 85 Suras in the Quran. You take the number of the Sura and add it to &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">48:56</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">the number of the last verse where you see the &nbsp;word &quot;God&quot; in that Sura. For example, in Sura Al-F&atilde;tehah</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">49:01</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem (1:1) Al hamdu Lillahi Rabbil &lsquo;Alameen (1:2)</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">49:06</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">is number 2. So, 1 plus 2 is 3 for &nbsp;Sura 1. You do this in every Sura of the 85</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">49:12</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Suras where the word &quot;God&quot; occurs. The number of the Sura plus the last verse where</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">49:18</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">you see the word &quot;God.&quot; And this, of course, has to &nbsp;do with the Sura 9. When it comes to Sura 9, you add</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">49:25</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">127 and not 129. And you do this in all 85 Suras, add up. The total is 9101 which is a multiple of 19.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">49:36</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Tooboo Ela Allah. Repent.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">49:50</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Alhamdu Lillah. We praise God. Wa Ash-hadu Alla Elaha Ella Allah Wahdahu La Shareeka Lah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">50:03</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Last week, Mohtasham gave us an excellent Khutba. Let &nbsp;me, let me come back to this. But I just always forget &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">50:15</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">this new discovery that came to us in the mail from &nbsp;Turkey and it has to do with verse 3:81. This</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">50:25</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">happens quite often in the Quran where you have a &nbsp;statement in the Quran and the opponents will come up</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">50:33</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">with something contradictory to it. But then &nbsp;God puts the answer to their claims somewhere else &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">50:43</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">in the Quran. For example, verse 3:81 talks &nbsp;about the Messenger of the Covenant.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">50:50</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">It says that after all the prophets, and this is any translation &nbsp;will tell you about it. After all the prophets have &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">50:56</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">come to this world and delivered their scriptures &nbsp;and the messages, a messenger will come to &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">51:01</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">unify, purify, consolidate these messages into &nbsp;one. This is verse 3:81. When you show this to the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">51:10</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">idol worshipers, they say &quot;that one is Muhammad. That messenger of the Covenant is Muhammad.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">51:17</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Even though the verse is very clear that it is not &nbsp;Muhammad because it begins by saying &quot;God made &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">51:24</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">a covenant with the prophets.&quot; We all recognize the &nbsp;Prophet Muhammad as a prophet, even they do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">51:32</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">He was the last prophet. Therefore, he must be included &nbsp;in that statement because God did not say&quot; He &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">51:39</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">made a covenant with the previous prophets or &nbsp;the prophets before you.&quot; God said &quot;He made a</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">51:45</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">covenant with the prophets.&quot; So, the answer to this &nbsp;claim is in 33:7 where God says &quot;I made the covenant &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">51:56</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">with the prophets including you, Muhammad.&quot; So, &nbsp;this is at the very... at the other end of the Quran. So, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">52:04</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">it shuts them up. Now, the discovery that Edip Yuksel made... Ismail Barakat: No, it doesn&#39;t, Rashad. It doesn&#39;t. The messenger: Oh, I&#39;m sorry. Yeah. It doesn&#39;t shut them up, but</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">52:11</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">shuts up that particular item. Edip&#39;s friend in Turkey counted the verses from 3:81 to the answer to their &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">52:22</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">claim 33:7 and found that the number of verses is a multiple of 19. 3192.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">52:29</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">The messenger: Yes. The Basmalah are verses. The Basmalahs are unnumbered verses, as we know, from this miracle on the wall where we did not &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">52:40</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">count them and the whole number is a multiple of 19. And when our brother, Ali Fazeli,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">52:46</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">suggested that we put 0 for every Basmalah &nbsp;in the Quran, we thought this whole thing will &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">52:51</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">collapse. We shouldn&#39;t have thought that. But we put &nbsp;the zeros there and sure enough it still was &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">52:57</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">a multiple of 19. Ismail Barakat: Subhan Allah. The messenger: We are the luckiest people on earth. There is no question about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">53:08</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Anyway, with your help, all of us together... pardon? Shakira. We know we are lucky? A woman: Only we know that we are lucky. The messenger: Yes. That&#39;s what counts.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">53:21</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">The messenger: Anyone who believes will discover that too &nbsp;because they will join the lucky, luckiest. </span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">53:28</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">I mean to be born at this particular time in this &nbsp;particular place and all the circumstances that &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">53:33</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">brought us together. When you reflect on your &nbsp;circumstances, you can see how God directed &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">53:39</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">you to this particular situation. Obviously, because &nbsp;you deserve that. OK. Mohtasham gave us an excellent &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">53:47</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Khutba, last week. And he talked about the &nbsp;responsibility which goes with the extreme &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">53:53</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">great fortune that God bestowed upon us. His blessing and grace comes with responsibility.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">54:01</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">What is our responsibility towards us, our souls, the real persons? Because God spreads it out to us,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">54:11</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">He tells us exactly what to do. So, I want to add to what Mohtasham said is that we now recognize that &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">54:20</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">the human being consists of the soul, that&#39;s the real person, and the body. The soul... when a baby</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">54:32</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">is born, the soul is assigned to that body. &nbsp;And the first thing that as soon as Shakira</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">54:42</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">pulls the baby out, the baby cries. Then, she gives him &nbsp;a spank. You spank the babies when you deliver them?</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">54:48</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">No? Do they cry anyway? They always &nbsp;cry. Sometimes they don&#39;t cry? They all cry.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">55:01</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">I see. It helps them breathe. I think they cry because they get trapped. But, really I&#39;m curious. All of them</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">55:08</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">100 percent of them cry. Or do you get sometimes the baby that&#39;s still under &nbsp; anesthesia or something? Shakira: No, if there is a problem, they don&#39;t cry. The messenger: Oh, I see. When the baby comes, if the baby doesn&#39;t cry &quot;uh-uh.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">55:24</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Ismail Barakat: There&#39;s another thing. Wouldn&#39;t you cry if you came to this place? The messenger: Yes, that&#39;s the whole idea.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">55:37</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">The messenger: So, what do we do... what do we do for the body? Ok. Let&#39;s &nbsp;say what are our responsibilities to the body?</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">55:49</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">We go to school. We study and take exams. Just ask, Farhad, how he likes that. Today, it is big, big prelim test.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">56:04</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">And how many years we go to school? So &nbsp;many years we go to college.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">56:12</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Is college fun, Beth? All the tests and the studying, &nbsp;how hard it is. Then, you go to grad school &quot;oh no.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">56:29</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">I used to get mad at people who tell me &quot;it&#39;s cool. It&#39;s fun.&quot; You know, how... I said &quot;you wanna take my &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">56:36</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">place.&quot; Ok. Then, after that, we work. Every morning, &nbsp;we set the alarm. We go to work, we drive in the traffic. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">56:52</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">And in Tucson, it&#39;s not as bad as other places. We drive in the &nbsp;traffic and we go to face the boss. Everyone hates the boss. I don&#39;t know why.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">57:07</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">And work until five o&#39;clock. &nbsp;A woman: We don&#39;t hate you.

If we review what &nbsp;we have seen through, through the Al-Baqarah, this &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:05:30</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">second Sura and third up to this point, what &nbsp;we have been told, what we have been taught is that &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:05:42</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">what we have to do as individuals basically, what we have to do to be righteous,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:05:49</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">how do we have to behave in, in the society and &nbsp;how to take care of ourselves as far as we are &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:05:57</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">concerned and our own interests are concerned. Now, we &nbsp;are seeing God telling us about a community.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:06:04</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">I go to the verse 84 of this same Sura &nbsp;not too far. It&#39;s page 61. The title of it is:</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:06:16</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Make No Distinction Among God&#39;s Messengers. I see a &nbsp;relationship between this community that God</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:06:23</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">is saying that we raised among you people. These &nbsp;people who are in this community, they are saying &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:06:31</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">[3:84] &quot;We believe in GOD, and in what was sent down to us, and in what was sent down to Abraham, Ismail, Isaac, Jacob, and the Patriarchs, and in what was given to Moses, Jesus, and the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction among any of them. To Him alone we are Muslims.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:06:52</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">In this community if you look at this verse 84, it almost covers everyone that you can see around you in this world</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:07:04</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">at the current time. If someone can believe and can &nbsp;uphold this verse and see the world and see the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:07:16</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">people as all people who only believe in God and &nbsp;what was sent down to the people from Him, then &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:07:27</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">you won&#39;t see any, any problem in the world. So, this &nbsp;is one characteristic of those people who are</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:07:34</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">in that community. Then, I go to two verses, 103 and &nbsp;104, the same just page 63.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:07:46</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Unity: a trait of the believers [3:103] You shall hold fast to the rope of GOD, all of you, and do not be divided.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:07:53</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">So again, another characteristic of these people, this community, the people in this community is that they are... all of them hold fast to the rope of God because He is the One that everybody is holding to.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:08:08</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">And do not be divided. This is a very important thing, you know, &nbsp;don&#39;t be divided. How, why people get divided?</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:08:15</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">What is the reason for the world being such a nasty &nbsp;place to live in? What is all the division? What is it for?</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:08:23</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">You see, in the book, in this book, in Quran, you don&#39;t see any trace of race, color, nationality &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:08:30</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">whatsoever or whatever we can think of. So, even &nbsp;religion, everybody, all the people who are part of &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:08:37</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">that best community, they are all the same because &nbsp;they hang on to the rope of God and they follow &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:08:45</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">what He tells them to follow. So, in this community, &nbsp;there is room for everyone regardless of what &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:08:51</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">shape they are, what color they are, what race they &nbsp;are. There is nothing except believing in God and &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:09:00</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">being righteous. I continue on 103. God says &nbsp;you used to be enemies and He [(the God)] reconciled your hearts. By His grace, you became brethren. You were at the brink of a pit of fire, and He saved you</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:09:17</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Look, you look around in the world everywhere you see, there&#39;s fire, there&#39;s bloodshed, there&#39;s killing,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:09:24</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">there&#39;s unrest, there is disease. [3:103] GOD thus explains His revelations for you, that you may be guided.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:09:31</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">I think 104 is a good one, too, related to same, to &nbsp;the same issue.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:09:37</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">[3:104] Let there be a community Here God says &quot;let there be a community&quot; [3:104] ...of you who invite to goodness, advocate righteousness, and forbid evil. These are the successful ones.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:09:48</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">In this one, in this verse, God is telling that He puts, lays the conditions.

And then, God says that you are the best community ever raised. This &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:10:10</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">is something current, it&#39;s at the present time &nbsp;and the future.

He&#39;s &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:10:17</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">telling them &quot;you are the best.&quot; If one... if we think &nbsp;we are, then we have to analyze ourselves every &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:10:25</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">day and see whether we are upholding what I read &nbsp;to you from those verses that which is related to &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:10:32</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">the conditions. You cannot say that okay, I go to &nbsp;this mosque, I do my prayers and I&#39;m one of the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:10:41</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">ones who is the happiest, who is the best.

These two words &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:10:54</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">&quot;advocating righteousness and forbidding evil&quot;, it &nbsp;is part of the responsibility of the believers,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:11:03</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">the people who believe in God. Because up to this &nbsp;point, whatever you saw was something related to &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:11:08</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">your personal duties by praying, like fasting, like Hajj, like Zakat, whatever. But now, you are part of a &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:11:17</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">community. This is your social responsibilities to &nbsp;advocate righteousness. How do you, how do you do it?</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:11:24</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">God doesn&#39;t tell you how to do it. So, you have &nbsp;to find a way to do it the best way possible. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:11:29</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">If you are part of that community that God is &nbsp;saying that you are the best ever raised among &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:11:35</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">the people, then the responsibilities that go with &nbsp;it is huge.

The only thing that I live &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:27:23</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">for is my next injection, my next round of drug.&quot; And they asked one of these kids who was the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:27:35</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">son of one of the big shots in the government and &nbsp;I think it was Mike Wallace asked him &quot;okay, what does &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:27:42</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">your dad, you know, how does your dad does do this? You know, he has so much money.&quot; And he &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:27:48</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">said &quot;doesn&#39;t he feel that, you know, these &nbsp;empires with so much money can do anything about &nbsp; this? Where is the morality?&quot; And he answered that &nbsp;when he goes he is a moral man but when he goes &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:28:00</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">to work, he leaves his morality at home because &nbsp;business doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the &nbsp; morality. That&#39;s business, so he has to do his job. But when he comes home, he&#39;s worried about what &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:28:10</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">happens. But that was a very good example of what &nbsp;is, what is really happening to the, the youngsters &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:28:19</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">of this, this world and in the heart of a country, in a city that is known as one of the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:28:28</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">best places that, you know, the heaven of the rich, the heaven of the people and this was</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:28:36</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">an example of which I thought is... was very moving &nbsp;and very ironic. So, I stop here and ask for any &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:28:48</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">questions or comments.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">onsequence of losing the 5 daily prayers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:29:01</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">The messenger: I think I will open this... somebody asked about this. I open the discussion with verse 115 where it says</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:29:10</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">[3:115] Any good they do will not go unrewarded. GOD is fully aware of who the righteous are.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:29:17</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">It&#39;s talking about the righteous Jews and Christians. As we learned from Sura 19, they lost their contact prayers, for example. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:29:28</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">They do not do the five prayers. Five prayers are very very very, infinite very important &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:29:36</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">because they go a long way towards proving that &nbsp;God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, is our god.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:29:42</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">They remind us of God and, you know, benefits that we &nbsp;just cannot overestimate, overemphasize.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:29:50</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">So, the Jews and Christians do not have the 5 daily prayers. These righteous Jews and Christians described here, they recite</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:30:01</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">God&#39;s revelations through the night and they fall &nbsp;prostrate, they advocate righteousness, they forbid &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:30:07</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">evil and they hasten to do righteous works, &nbsp;charitable works, and so on. And this is why God is</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:30:14</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">saying that these things will not go unrewarded. So, they&#39;ll be rewarded for this, but it is nothing &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:30:20</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">compared to the specific steps of rites that God prescribes for us, the Prayers, the fasting of Ramadan. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:30:29</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">As you know, within our lifetime, the Christians, &nbsp;for example, lost the fasting. First there was no &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:30:35</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">meat on Friday and in Easter or, what is it, the Lent, they used to give up important things. Now, they give up</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:30:46</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Macadamia nuts. So, they lost the fasting. They &nbsp;lost the contact prayers. And these are the important &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:30:57</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">things that cause our souls to grow and develop. So, I just... this is a very important verse 115.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:31:04</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">The implication from the Arabic text, and &nbsp;I hope this is reflected in the English,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:31:09</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">is that these are all good things. They recite God&#39;s &nbsp;revelations, they fall prostrate, they are righteous, they advocate</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:31:15</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">righteousness, they forbid evil, they have high &nbsp;moral standards, they are truthful and honest, but &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:31:21</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">all these things, all these things combined will &nbsp;be a small fraction of what we get from the five &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:31:29</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">daily prayers, for example. The five daily prayers are so important that... Shakira: Are they the most important of all the prayers? The messenger: Definitely.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c0">1:31:39</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Shakira: So, if...</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c5 c1 c4" id="h.164k3onu23km"><span class="c8">04 Quran Study From Azhar 4 Sura 37 By Rashad Shakira Present Astroid 01 21 1990 Sura 3;118 129 By S</span></h1><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: My God, you guys eat too many sweets.

Ismail Barakat: And they found that he&#39;s a good liar. The messenger: Established once and for all that he&#39;s a liar.

So, this is number</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">one, storming the gates. Number two is tunneling their way under the fence.

Here is the answer. We&#39;re going to find out on the Day of Judgment, this is how they got to hell. Some of them stormed the gates.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Number two, some of them tunnel their way under the fence. Ismail Barakat: They tackle the 19 angels who guard hell and try to beat them.

And they get</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in by fighting their way in. This is what they are saying. The messenger: Exactly. A woman: And the final wall was 19.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Yes, 19 walls, 19 fences.

Somersault.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Somersault their way &quot;hey, I made three somersaults.&quot; A man: The problem is who will take the big one, now?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: The next one, number five. Ismail Barakat: No, no, the big one, you see, they open the gates and let him in.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: Because there are seven gates. The messenger: Yes, number five, there are seven gates. A man: They all go in cannon.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: The cannonball, human cannonball. A man: And they fire it. Shakira: Now, where did you get all this from? A man: Sura 115. The messenger: Sura 115.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: If your imagination is not...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Even if gets very scary. Shakira: No, but in the Quran, it says that the people will try to come towards Heaven. And then they can&#39;t, they won&#39;t be able to stand it and they&#39;ll go back.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&#39;ll keep going back, they&#39;ll try to go and come back and try to go and come back. And here they&#39;re pole vaulting. The messenger: Yes, no, we&#39;re talking, but now they are doing this, see. Now they&#39;re</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">like for example, how do you explain, the guy, we tell him &quot;Sura Q&atilde;f has 57 Qafs.&quot; He says &quot;no, the word &#1601;&#1614;&#1581;&#1614;&#1602;&#1614;&#1617;, because there is a Shadda on it, it&#39;s two Qafs. It&#39;s FAHAQAQA.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s not 57, it&#39;s 58, there is no miracle there.&quot; How do you stop this guy? Now this guy is trying a cannon. Ismail Barakat: No, no, no, God doesn&#39;t want them to go to hell. God wants all to go to paradise.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: In fact, Sura 39 says, God does not like it. Shakira: They insist on going to hell, that&#39;s what it says. They insist. The messenger: There you go, that&#39;s the answer to your question.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: So, we will not be sad because we will realize that they tried all these methods to force themselves into hell. I usually, I used, they jumped the fence. This is the</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">only thing I used, because this is what I used to do. When there was a soccer ball in my hometown, and they are fighting for the final championship, and they have, at the club,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the soccer balls, the two champion teams coming to my hometown. And they have police on horses</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">patrolling the fence out there. I was there, an expert in jumping fences. That was a</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">high fence, like 7 feet, with the things pointing and the head like that. So, I waited until two</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">horses were facing the other way, and then.... And I&#39;m in the club to watch the game.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Must have been 7 years old. Shakira: You know, in India, they have walls with a glass on top of it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ismail Barakat: Right, they have the same thing in Egypt. It doesn&#39;t stop them, though. Shakira: I used to climb over it and go and steal grapes. And one day, the guy came behind me. You know, my grandfather,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he&#39;s the dean of Osmania University, my grandfather. And I used to do these terrible things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My sister and I, we jumped it, and we went into the grape garden, and we stole the grapes,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and we jumped back. The man came behind us with a stick. The messenger: You never forget that. Shakira: He came behind us with a stick</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and my uncle, you know, the Nizam of Hyderabad. He is the architect for the Nizam of Hyderabad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they were constructing this big thing for the Nizam, my uncle. And he took us there, and this is what we were doing. He was so ashamed of us that he just said &quot;these people don&#39;t</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">belong to me.&quot; The messenger: &quot;I don&#39;t know them. I never saw them in my life, these grape thieves.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: We were little kids. &quot;I don&#39;t know these people. Who are these people? I don&#39;t...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: Oh, my God. The messenger: So, I used to jump the fence to get into the soccer game. And these people in hell, we will realize</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that they insisted. They jumped so many fences to go to. hell. Shakira: Yeah, they insist on going to hell. Ismail Barakat: But you see, what you did,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you waited until the guards weren&#39;t looking. These guys are gonna attack the guards. The messenger: Yes. Exactly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: In fact, they said that if &quot;19 of the guards of hell, leave them to me, some big guy.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: So your imagination, he used his imagination to do five things? The messenger: Yes. Behrouz: No, he has 19.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: We are thinking of the ways and means that they are forcing themselves. Shakira: Yeah, some of them can</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">go in a tank. The messenger: How about balloons? Shakira: You don&#39;t have a tank? Hot air balloons.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ismail Barakat: Balloons are not very good, because you see hot air rises. The messenger: He&#39;s talking about the kite.

He&#39;ll jump from it or something. The messenger: Yeah, the kite. He&#39;s talking about the kite.

Something that&#39;s happened to Ismail. It gives an example of the disbeliever jumping</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the fence into hell. Because the second verse here uses the word &#1601;&#1614;&#1649;&#1604;&#1586;&#1614;&#1617;&#1648;&#1580;&#1616;&#1585;&#1614;&#1648;&#1578;&#1616; &#1586;&#1614;&#1580;&#1618;&#1585;&#1611;&#1773;&#1575; (37:2) which I translated here as &quot;the blamers.&quot; Some guy came to Ismail and said &quot;what is &#1649;&#1604;&#1586;&#1614;&#1617;&#1648;&#1580;&#1616;&#1585;&#1614;&#1648;&#1578;&#1616;?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, he leaves all the straightforward verses in Quran &quot;can you tell me?

Ismail Barakat: Ah, I see, I see. The messenger: These are the easts.

One time, I was in Washington, D.C.,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and the question of Ramadan came up. So, I reached for the newspaper, the Washington Post,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to show the person that the new moon, he could see the new moon in the paper, and</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it will tell you when the new month is. You don&#39;t need to go out and look through the clouds for the moon, which is very thin, it&#39;s impossible to see with binoculars and all this. Especially</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">if you&#39;re blind like Ben Bez and try to decide when the, you know. So, you know what</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of the followers announces they are colour blind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I found in the Washington Post? You can pick it up at any drug store. They have the moon...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">...all solar system. Ismail Barakat: Yeah, and in the paper, in Vancouver Sun. The messenger: Yeah, but I was really amazed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Yes, yes, we have the sun and the moon here. Yes. But at the Washington Post and probably the New</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">York Times, the major newspapers, I know the Washington Post does it every day. I mean,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">if you wanna see what time Saturn rises, and the new Saturn, it&#39;s just a...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ismail Barakat: They don&#39;t even know what Saturn looks like.

Saturn has the rings on it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ismail Barakat: You can&#39;t see it with the naked eye. You need telescope.

To me they&#39;re all alike. A man: And also the time they rise is different.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ismail Barakat: Yeah, of course. The messenger: Those people are so behind, you know.

Because we are sitting in a place that&#39;s half light and half dark.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, we have the rises, and we&#39;re rotating. So, we have the rises of all these planets.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As far as anything in the heaven is concerned, there&#39;s rise and set because of our rotation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Behrouz: Yeah, because there&#39;s no one else. The messenger: Why do I do rotation like this? Actually, it&#39;s like this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It doesn&#39;t matter, we may be upside down. Let&#39;s say we&#39;re sitting upside down right now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Behrouz: But there&#39;s another time... The messenger: This (unintelligible) doesn&#39;t fall off. Ismail Barakat: It never does.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: I didn&#39;t understand when I was little, you know, we talked about everything around us. I was wondering how</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">come nothing fell. I didn&#39;t understand gravity. I was very little. The messenger: Gravity. The messenger: The way to understand it is to imagine an ant walking in this globe. An ant is walking around, it&#39;s cool,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in this globe. A woman: Yeah, I understand it now. A man: Upside down. A woman: No, I was a little kid. I understand it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: So, this is the way we are. A woman: Yeah, but it&#39;s wonderful. But I was little and I was fascinated by it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Sorry, Behrouz, I interrupted you. Behrouz: So, one time you talked about the two Easts and two Wests.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Right. That&#39;s the sun and the moon. Yeah, sun and the moon. Two major things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Behrouz: Two majors for the humans and jinns. The messenger: Right. Ismail Barakat: What&#39;s that again? Behrouz: I like that one better.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Or the sunrise for the humans and the jinns. Ismail Barakat: So, it&#39;s the same thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Yeah, but you see... Behrouz: For jinns must be, I mean, might be something different.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Well, the jinns on earth, they will have the sunrise and the sunset. Ismail Barakat: The same thing as ours. The messenger: No, but God wanted to make a point that there</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">are two sets of creatures on earth. Sura Al-Rahmaan, for example, is directed to the two, two, I mean, &#1649;&#1604;&#1579;&#1614;&#1617;&#1602;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1740;&#1606;, these are called, &#1649;&#1604;&#1579;&#1614;&#1617;&#1602;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1740;&#1606;, the humans and the jinns. So, God is talking to them separately because they have</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">separate needs. For example, a jinn will not care about steak, but you would. And you</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">do not care about a box of matches for dinner. But they like it, maybe to them. I mean, I don&#39;t know</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">what they like for dinner. So, if God describes heaven to them as fruits and rivers of milk</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and honey and they don&#39;t care about these things, they say &quot;oh, we don&#39;t want to go there.&quot; So, that... what was that? A man: Fatiha on Tuesday. Don&#39;t forget that. A man: Fatiha on Tuesday.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Soad again? Oh, boy, she&#39;s nervous about the test. She&#39;ll call us from the airport.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Don&#39;t forget, Fatiha on Tuesday. Ismail Barakat: But the Qur&#39;an, I think, is directed to us, not to them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ismail Barakat: Essentially, it&#39;s directed to us. The messenger: No, no, to us and the jinns. &#1602;&#1615;&#1604;&#1618; &#1571;&#1615;&#1608;&#1581;&#1616;&#1609;&#1614; &#1573;&#1616;&#1604;&#1614;&#1609;&#1614;&#1617; &#1571;&#1614;&#1606;&#1614;&#1617;&#1607;&#1615; &#1649;&#1587;&#1618;&#1578;&#1614;&#1605;&#1614;&#1593;&#1614; &#1606;&#1614;&#1601;&#1614;&#1585;&#1612;&#1773; &#1605;&#1616;&#1617;&#1606;&#1614; &#1649;&#1604;&#1618;&#1580;&#1616;&#1606;&#1616;&#1617; &#1601;&#1614;&#1602;&#1614;&#1575;&#1604;&#1615;&#1608;&#1619;&#1575;&#1759; &#1573;&#1616;&#1606;&#1614;&#1617;&#1575; &#1587;&#1614;&#1605;&#1616;&#1593;&#1618;&#1606;&#1614;&#1575; &#1602;&#1615;&#1585;&#1618;&#1569;&#1614;&#1575;&#1606;&#1611;&#1575; &#1593;&#1614;&#1580;&#1614;&#1576;&#1611;&#1773;&#1575; (72:1)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Quran is for the humans and the Jinns.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#1608;&#1614;&#1573;&#1616;&#1584;&#1618; &#1589;&#1614;&#1585;&#1614;&#1601;&#1618;&#1606;&#1614;&#1570; &#1573;&#1616;&#1604;&#1614;&#1610;&#1618;&#1603;&#1614; &#1606;&#1614;&#1601;&#1614;&#1585;&#1611;&#1773;&#1575; &#1605;&#1616;&#1617;&#1606;&#1614; &#1649;&#1604;&#1618;&#1580;&#1616;&#1606;&#1616;&#1617; (46:29) We&#39;ll send the jinns to you to listen to the Quran.

It may turn into a</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">beautiful word, very expressive. Yes, that&#39;s a good idea, also.

But the word KAFIR</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is generally used for a disbeliever, a pagan. So you can use that. Actually, it&#39;s a very</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">expressive term.

Yes. And this is why, this is why you are up now. Shakira: I&#39;m sure we know, understand it exactly like that. And possibly we understand the same thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: We are working hard right now. We are working hard right now. The messenger: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rising for Fujr is difficult but should get easier. Discussion of Ramadan during summer months (Indication of Astronomical timing used).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ismail Barakat: I&#39;m not working. Shakira: We are having a good time, M&atilde; Sh&atilde; All&atilde;h. But exactly, that&#39;s why. The messenger: No, but if you didn&#39;t come across this message, you&#39;d be fast asleep at this moment, right now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: So, according to God, this is work. The messenger: Most people out there... Here comes my favorite impersonation. They&#39;re all...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: He says in the Quran that it is very hard for you to get up in the morning and pray. I know that it is hard for you to get up and pray in the morning, but not so for the believers. He says you will get up if you&#39;re a believer. It will not be hard for you. So that&#39;s why you say like that, The messenger: Exactly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: because you&#39;re a good believer and it&#39;s not hard for you to get up. It&#39;s no longer hard for you. It used to be, but it is not, M&atilde; Sh&atilde; All&atilde;h. The messenger: It used to be. I had to beat him up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: And He specifically says about the morning prayer. The messenger: You see, Ismail, especially Ismail, because he&#39;s a night owl. He goes to bed like two or three in the morning and in Vancouver the night is half an hour.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: But you know, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s the same with everybody. But you know that sometimes I&#39;m so afraid to miss one NAMAZ (Contact Prayer). I&#39;m so afraid. The messenger: Yes. God bless you. M&atilde; Sh&atilde; All&atilde;h.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: I just panic. I have to be up, otherwise I panic. The messenger: It gets easier and easier.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: You see, at first, it&#39;s difficult, then it becomes easier. But for Ismail, you missed what I said that the night in Vancouver is half an hour.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ismail Barakat: Half hour. The messenger: You pray ISHA and then you shouldn&#39;t sleep. You stick around for 20 more minutes and you pray Fajr. Ismail Barakat: That&#39;s what I do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: The night is short. The messenger: In the summer. Shakira: You know when, when, you know, I was in Alaska in July, it never became...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ismail Barakat: It&#39;s getting darker. A woman: I have a picture that I brought in to Rashad. They had a time-lapse photography of the sun just touching the horizon and going back up. But how do you get sunset, the night and sunrise in there? It&#39;s two seconds. Shakira: That picture is from Alaska.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">when it just touches the horizon. The messenger: July 21st, June 21st. Shakira: I was in Vancouver in July. Ismail Barakat: It&#39;s not July? Shakira: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Oh my God, you should have met our people there. Shakira: But in July I was not a believer. The messenger: Oh, yes, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Next time, next time, be sure to give Ismail your phone. Shakira: Yeah. We went to Alaska. We went up to the Arctic Pole, you know. We went up to Denali National Park and Fairbanks. The messenger: She&#39;s been aflame since then.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: It was so beautiful. Anchorage is so beautiful.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: So in Ramadan, we have just barely enough time to drink.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ismail Barakat: You know, In fact, it&#39;s impossible for me anyway. It&#39;s impossible for me to eat two meals.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Yes, I know. Even I ate one meal in Ramadan. Shakira: That is going to be (unintelligible) because I eat so little that if I don&#39;t eat it every day, it&#39;s hard for me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: You&#39;d better make it easy. You&#39;ll be a bit surprised. Ismail Barakat: Just like getting up for Fajr. It&#39;s the same thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: The first three days are gonna be difficult but that&#39;s it. Shakira: I&#39;m totally accepting that. Behrouz: Ziba was saying that she was listening to the talk show on radio and doctors were talking about this diet, like you start eating certain things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They come to the conclusion that after 13 or 15 hours, your body does not get any food</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">anymore. It&#39;s like a chemical, the body provides like an antibiotic that cures the whole body. The messenger: Yes. M&atilde; Sh&atilde; All&atilde;h.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ismail Barakat: What does it do? It cures the whole body? Shakira: What did he say? The messenger: It cleanses the body. Like a hormone. Shakira: What did they find? The messenger: This doctor was speaking.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Behrouz: They found out after 14 hours, if you do not eat anything, the body provides something that cleans the whole body. The messenger: Like an antibody or the hormones</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: It&#39;s like a Roto-Rooter and cholesterol. Behrouz: If you use it, it&#39;s good for you. The messenger: The body produces the Roto-Rooter to clean the veins. I believe it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Ramadan will be, it&#39;s getting shorter and shorter every day. It&#39;s gonna be March. This year, it will be March 27th.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ismail Barakat: Now, Ramadan in Vancouver around Christmas time is fantastic.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Yes, the day is half hour. A man: The day would be half hour.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ismail Barakat: You know, all I used to do was, I don&#39;t usually eat a big lunch anyway, but I used to, all I did was miss my coffee in the morning and my coffee in the afternoon. That was the extent of it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: These guys laugh at me all the time when I get in Vancouver because I&#39;m all confused about the times. That&#39;s why I ask (intelligible). What I ask, he said &quot;we still have four hours left.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: When I go up there in the summer, it&#39;s real strange. I normally go to bed early. I tend to go to bed and then wake up and pray the Night because I&#39;ve already gone to bed before the Night.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have to wake up and pray the Night and then go back to bed. Ismail Barakat: I used to do this a lot in summer. I&#39;d go to bed and then wake up for ISHA and then stay up for Fajr and then go to bed. A woman: No, I wouldn&#39;t do that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: It&#39;s a lot of fun anyway. Lydia visits DC every year. Shakira: Definitely, Ramadan is starting on 27th? The messenger: IN SHAA ALLAH, yes. Shakira: IN SHAA ALLAH.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: But why do they make such a big deal of the moon and this and that? I mean, every year there&#39;s a big hassle. There&#39;s a big hassle. I mean, they can never... The messenger: Because of Hadith. This is the whole idea. Isamil Barakat: Hadith.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: You can tell the Ramadan... Ismail Barakat: They screw up every year, every year. The messenger: Yes, they never pass... Shakira: Every year. Always, you know</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: India has one Eid and Pakistan has another Eid. All the time. Every single time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: They never had a shot of the same thing. Ismail Barakat: In Egypt now, I understand, Rashad, they use astronomical means. The messenger: No, they don&#39;t. They write it down. Astronomically, Ramadan will begin on March 27th. But the stupid Mufti has to tell them it&#39;s the 28th or the 26th. It&#39;s never the right day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, he seems to go out of his way to oppose the astronomical. Shakira: And Eid will be on 25? 26th. The messenger: 26th. Last day is 25. April 25.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ismail Barakat: And you know, they come up with the dumbest obfuscation &quot;that it is impossible to determine when the moon appears.&quot; What are you talking about? Darn Americans put a guy at a certain spot within two feet of the spot</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on the moon where it&#39;s supposed to be. And you guys can&#39;t even see it. Jesus Christ.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: Is it OK to say Jesus Christ? The messenger: No. Shakira: But I say it all the time. Jeez. I say Jeez all the time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Jeez, yes, maybe. I say it &quot;cheese&quot; so it&#39;s mine. Shakira: I can&#39;t say Jesus Christ? The messenger: No. Better to avoid it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Why? Shakira: Because you grew up with it. The messenger: I know, but I&#39;m asking why you say Jesus Christ. It&#39;s a commemoration.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ismail Barakat: But usually you say it in negative terms. The messenger: But Satan doesn&#39;t know that. Satan will point at you and says &quot;he&#39;s commemorating Jesus Christ.&quot; Because Jesus is dead. Really. Jesus will take the appearances.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ismail Barakat: I stop this one. The messenger: Yes. Definitely. Ismail Barakat: God willing, it&#39;s the last time with Satan. The messenger: Yeah. You see, Satan hates you. You know that. And he will play dumb. Says &quot;Ismail Barakat is commemorating Jesus Christ.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: God will tell Satan &quot;you know what he means and I know what he means.&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t care.&quot; Satan. Crybaby. He&#39;s the biggest crybaby. Yes. The biggest crybaby.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And invariably God will grant him, because we give him the excuse. So, God grants him his excuse. He says &quot;It&#39;s OK. Go fix Ismail.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: I&#39;ll say something, but do you mean everybody has to, God has to forgive me. And then I think He was getting bored.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Who? Shakira: God. Ismail Barakat: No, no, no The messenger: No. The people in Heaven, this way she said, God forgive me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Because even in Heaven the creatures will never be bored. This is... two things that would never happen in Heaven: being bored and being tired. Shakira: He didn&#39;t say &quot;bored.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: He said &quot;I will take away your worry. I will take away your jealousy. I will take away your tiredness.&quot; He didn&#39;t say &quot;I&#39;ll take away your bored.&quot; The messenger: Yes. Yes. Bored, yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: Bored? The messenger: He takes away being bored. You&#39;ll never be bored. Shakira: It says that in the Quran? M&atilde; Sh&atilde; All&atilde;h. The messenger: Yes, in 14 or 15, I forget. Shakira: OK. Don&#39;t worry about it. So long as we can be happy. The messenger: Yes, take my word for it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ismail Barakat: But it&#39;ll be awfully boring, you know, because you&#39;ve got a couple of trillion years. Shakira: I know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: I keep thinking I&#39;ll do pelvic there. The messenger: Yep, anything you want. Shakira: Oh, my God. A man: Every day will be different.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: There are no days. One last day. Shakira: We&#39;ll be everlasting.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: We don&#39;t know whether it will be day or night or what. The messenger: One last day. Shakira: Will we sleep? I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: It&#39;ll be fun. Shakira: Everything is... The messenger: Mutual Blaming, 27. [37:27] They will blame one another. [37:28] They will say (to their leaders), &quot;You used to come to us from the right side.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Meaning pretending to be righteous. From the right side. 29.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[37:29] They will respond, &quot;It is you who were not believers. [37:30] &quot;We never had any power over you; it is you who were transgressors.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[37:31] &quot;We incurred our Lord&#39;s wrath; and now we have to suffer.

[37:34] This is how we requite the guilty.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now why are they in this bad position? Because of the following verses. [37:35] When they were told, &quot;L&atilde; El&atilde;ha Ella All&atilde;h [There is no other god beside GOD],&quot; they turned arrogant.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is invariably the case. Tell them L&atilde; El&atilde;ha Ella All&atilde;h, they beat you up. In fact, I have it on video. Did you watch this video of Bilal Phillips? I have this video of Bilal Phillips. He says &quot;now Rashad Khalifa exposed himself. He says, L&atilde; El&atilde;ha Ella All&atilde;h, and that&#39;s it. Can you imagine that?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All he says is L&atilde; El&atilde;ha Ella All&atilde;h.&quot; Doesn&#39;t this guy think? Ismail Barakat: No, the thing is that the Hadith that he accepts says, if you say L&atilde; El&atilde;ha Ella All&atilde;h, you are guaranteed paradise. The messenger: Yes, even the Quran, even the Jews and the Christians, according to Quran, who say L&atilde; El&atilde;ha Ella All&atilde;h, they make it to heaven.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know the theme of this Quran at the very beginning? If you believe in God,... Ismail Barakat: Sura 2:62. The messenger: Exactly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, even the Jews and the Christians obviously don&#39;t recognize Muhammad at all. Even the Jews who say L&atilde; El&atilde;ha Ella All&atilde;h, they go to heaven. And this guy, I have it here on the video. Anybody can see it. And he is saying &quot;Rashad Khalifa has gone completely bananas now. All he says is L&atilde; El&atilde;ha Ella All&atilde;h.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, what is this? Ismail Barakat: Well, he says &quot;L&atilde; El&atilde;ha Ella All&atilde;h... L&atilde; El&atilde;ha Ella All&atilde;h, Muhammadan Rasoolu Allah.&quot; The messenger: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: You know I have such a habit for it that sometimes I automatically say and then I just (unintelligible).

Shakira: Yeah, that&#39;s true.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: SHAHADA, what does... SHAHADA mean &quot;witness?&quot; The messenger: Yes. Shakira: SHAHADA is witness. The word SHAHADA means witness. The messenger: Did Pari share with you her discovery?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shakira: No, what? The messenger: That was a very significant discovery when she was here the last time. Shakira: Why? The messenger: She said, in the Quran, we witnessed God, Sura 7.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But we never witnessed any of the messengers. Shakira: Yes, of course we witnessed God</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">because it says very clearly. The messenger: Yes, and that&#39;s why God states the SHAHADA in the Quran in 3:18 as L&atilde; El&atilde;ha Ella All&atilde;h. And here it is again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">35, while they are in this dilemma, [37:35] When they were told, &quot;L&atilde; El&atilde;ha Ella All&atilde;h [There is no other god beside GOD],&quot; they turned arrogant. [37:36] They said, &quot;Shall we leave our gods for the sake of a crazy poet?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wow, this is what this guy said. Shakira: But in that verse God says, remember He brought us all in front of Him. And then, so it&#39;s very clear there that we saw Him and He told us that. The messenger: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Yes, and the word SHAHADA is used. Do you bear witness I am your Lord? And we said we bear witness.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(7:172) &#1602;&#1614;&#1575;&#1604;&#1615;&#1608;&#1575;&#1759; &#1576;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1609;&#1648; &#1755; &#1588;&#1614;&#1607;&#1616;&#1583;&#1618;&#1606;&#1614;&#1570; I mean, God uses the same word.

The messenger: No.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Pieces of meteorites float in the space, billions of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of them will come and there&#39;s one now that intersects the orbit of the earth. You know what this means? Did you hear the test of it? The earth&#39;s orbit around the sun is like this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the earth is here, the asteroid goes in the orbit like that. And then comes back and hits the orbit like that. It keeps doing this. So, one of those times the earth would be in that spot.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: The five daily prayers are so important that...

Hatred shows through their mouths and what their chests hide is even worse. We have clarified the revelations for you, that you may understand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">119. [3:119] Here you are loving them, while they do not love you, and you believe in all the scripture. When they meet you they say, &quot;We believe,&quot; then as soon as they leave they bite their fingers out of rage towards you. Say, &quot;Die in your rage.&quot; GOD is fully aware of the innermost thoughts.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">120. [3:120] When something good touches you they hurt, and when something bad happens to you they rejoice. If you steadfastly persevere, and maintain righteousness, their schemes will never hurt you. GOD controls everything they do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m stop here because I think these three are related to each other under the title: Do Not Befriend Hypocrites.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is another lesson which we can relate it to that best community ever raised among the people. That God is telling us that be aware of the outsiders</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">who never cease to wish you harm and wish to see you suffer. The only person or people who can be like that, to suffer, to wish harm and want to see other people suffer,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they should be devilish. There is no humanity involved because that is the time that you have completely</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">given up your soul to the Satan. Because these are the things which are satanic, wishing other people harm and suffering. A righteous person, a person who believes in God</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and is leading a righteous life, he or she never wants suffering or harm for anybody else.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God is saying that hatred shows through their mouths and what their chest hide is even worse. That&#39;s very interesting. People who are like this, people who enjoy seeing other people suffer,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they harm themselves. They hurt themselves. They suffer more than the others because you live your life, you believe in God, you are living a life that you think you believe is the righteous life,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">but those people who have nothing else to just watch you and suffer because they suffer with the way that you walk, the way you talk, the way you eat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They just, whatever they do, they are the ones who are looking for something. They just all the time are, because they are full of so much hatred, which God says hatred shows through their mouths</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and what their chest is hiding is worse. I have seen it through my own life that no matter what you do, sometimes you are even unaware of the fact that some people are watching you and are suffering because of what you do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You are just doing it naturally because of your beliefs, but others who are watching you, they get hurt. It&#39;s just, either it&#39;s unacceptable to them or for no reason. For example, if I go and tell a friend that I go to</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday prayers, first of all they look at me and say &quot;hey, what is wrong with you? you know. What are you up to? Why you go to...&quot; Because it is the tradition in the Muslim world that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">either you are stupid and follow God&#39;s revelations, especially among the educated, or you are after something. Other than that, there is no reason for you to go to a Friday prayer</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">or go and spend your time reading the Quran. This is the fact. So, as soon as they hear that, their receivers in their radars start collecting all the signals.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And You wouldn&#39;t believe how many channels they have to receive. You are emitting on one channel, but they have a million channels receiving.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, they are the ones who worry about it. You don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re just leading what, you&#39;re doing what you believe is right, and hopefully it is, but they are the ones who are worrying</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">what is going on. Because they, although they say that they don&#39;t want to follow you, they don&#39;t wanna do the same thing that you do, but somehow, for some reason,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they are so much interested. They wanna see it. You know, they wanna know why. And when you tell them, then it&#39;s like talking to a stone wall.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[3:118] it&#39;s for you, that you may understand.

A righteous person, a believer, doesn&#39;t see any distinction among anybody else, and sees everyone the same.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is what we have a lot of discussion with my own kids, who are sleeping, both of them, more or less, about racial issues, you know, how we can blame other people for being racist,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">how we can blame other people looking at us differently, rather than looking, you know, similar to everybody else. But the fact is, I have to go first back to my own system,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and see whether I see anybody else differently, whether I see a white person from a black person, an oriental from an Iranian, and so on and so forth. If I can do, if I can clean myself,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">if I can purify my own soul, to see everyone else the same, then I won&#39;t have any problem with other people, because if they look at me, and</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they think that I am a different race, or they are racist, I look at them and I see that they are suffering, as God is saying exactly, they are the ones who are suffering</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">because they think that they want you to suffer, they enjoy it, but if you purify your own self, and get to the point that you are a righteous person, you don&#39;t see any difference between any other people</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and then you don&#39;t care about what the other people see, and that is what is expected from you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[3:119] ...When they meet you they say, &quot;We believe,&quot; I think most of us have that experience.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[3:119] ...then as soon as they leave they bite their fingers out of rage towards you.

I stop here,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">before starting 121, for questions and discussions again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Verse 119, where God says, that as soon as they leave, they bite their fingers out of rage. In Sura 25, verse 27 on page 362, God says</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[25:27] The day will come when the transgressor will bite his hands (in anguish)...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What I think is interesting here, very beautiful and interesting, is that God says that he knows what is in the chest, and He says, in Sura 3, verse 119, He&#39;s fully aware of your innermost thoughts.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This tendency to bite one&#39;s hands in an abnormal way, and bite the fingers, is very common in a person&#39;s anger and rage, and suffering.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They may appear to be otherwise, but this is something that can actually recognize, if possible, one kind of indication that a person has this anxiety and anguish, and God knows it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I see these two verses where we&#39;re talking about anger, rage, and God knows what is in the heart,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and He knows what human beings do, certain habits they develop as a function of whether</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">or not they&#39;re in a state of peace, or they are in a state of anguish or rage. So in that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sense, God is, He is aware, He knows the relationship between behavior, certain habits, the things</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we do, and what&#39;s happening inside us. And we see the major thing here, of the anguish, the rage and the suffering.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: I wanna talk about John 18, well, I mean, actually there are three of them. We are people who decided that God knows best, and we don&#39;t go to anyone else for what is good for us, what is bad for us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and we are His servants and creatures, and we decided we&#39;re gonna obey what He tells us. And God has a very good reason for any of these commandments.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now here, He&#39;s telling us, all you who believe, do not befriend outsiders, etc. etc.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He says &quot;Do not befriend them.&quot; Why is God telling us this?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From the experience we&#39;ve seen in the last 12 years in this Masjid, it&#39;s because these people, the outsiders,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">these people may take you away. And we know what this means. Actually, they will do everything possible</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to stop you from being here, from continuing to worship God and follow His commandments.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is the biggest disaster that can ever happen to anybody. And we&#39;ve seen it happen,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and we&#39;ve seen it happen, we&#39;ve seen the consequences for those people. And then God is giving criteria and descriptions of these people. So, a good subtitle here will be: Run for your life.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When you meet these people and sense that they are not totally</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in agreement with following God&#39;s commandments, for example if they mock the Friday prayers,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m telling you, I&#39;ve seen people who were dismissed from God&#39;s grace because of not doing the Friday prayers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They didn&#39;t have excuses. You have a very good excuse, a very good excuse.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But God knows. It&#39;s between you and God, that you cannot possibly make the Friday prayers, that&#39;s fine. But these are people who, in their mind, it is not important to do the Friday prayer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When God says &quot;when the Friday prayer comes, go to the Friday prayer and drop all business.&quot; God is saying this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I mean, we&#39;re either believers who follow God and obey him, or will not. There is no in between.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God is saying &quot;O you who believe, do not befriend outsiders who,&quot; etc, etc, all the descriptions. What is God&#39;s interest in this?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our welfare. Because if we mix with them, they will influence us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there is that chance or that possibility that may take us away from the path of God, and this is the biggest disaster.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Especially, when you come this close. When you&#39;re sitting here at noon witnessing miracles, right? Witnessing miracles, greater than Moses&#39; miracles when he threw down the staff.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, after seeing all this, when you see God&#39;s commandment, God says &quot;do not befriend them.&quot; Maybe you can talk to them. But befriend is a very dangerous disobedience of God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mahmoud: According to Quran, believers have the most powerful truth, and they do not (unintelligible) with people on the subject.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But those people here, who don&#39;t have any base or any discretion. Those people, they are not mischievous people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are playing in both sides. And for this reason, those people, to befriend these people will not</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">give you anything. You will not gain anything from them. They will not gain anything from you because really they are not sincere.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Even disastrous. Mahmoud: Yes, only they will give you bad things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Of course, you can try to help them, guide them, but once you have done this, you delivered the message, you tried to help them, and then you find that they are not responding,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and they continue their defiance of God and mocking you and so on. Run for your life.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s a very important commandment. You will not take God&#39;s orders lightly. &quot;O you who believe, do not befriend outsiders who never cease to wish you harm, etc.&quot; Now, you take this seriously.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Back to Dr. Subahi and one...

It&#39;s a very good psychological analysis.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Page 92 says, [4:89] They wish that you disbelieve as they have disbelieved, then you become equal.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to be in the same boat with them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s just they feel that, I don&#39;t know, I have a feeling that they sense your soul, the size of your soul, it kind of bothers them. You have a strong soul, you go there and you&#39;ll take over.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, they want you to be in the same boat as they are. Ok. 121, The Battle of Badr.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Sabahi: 121, The Battle of Badr. [3:121] Recall that you (Muhammad) set out to assign to your people their positions for battle. And GOD is Hearer, Omniscient.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">122. [3:122] Two groups of you almost failed, and GOD was their Lord. In GOD the believers shall trust.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[3:123] Thus, GOD gave you victory at Badr, even though you were weak. you shall observe GOD, to show your appreciation. [3:124] You told the believers, &quot;Is it not enough that your Lord supports you with three thousand angels, descending?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[3:125] Yes, if you steadfastly persevere and maintain righteousness, then they attack you suddenly, your Lord will supply you with five thousand* angels, well trained.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">126. [3:126] GOD gives you, this good news, to assure your hearts. Victory comes only from GOD, the Almighty, Most Wise.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">127. [3:127] He thus annihilates some disbelievers, or neutralizes them; so they end up in failure.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">128. [3:128] It is not up to you; He may redeem them, or punish them for their sins.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">129. [3:129] To GOD belongs everything in the heavens and everything on the earth. He forgives whomever He wills, and punishes whomever He wills. GOD is Forgiver, Merciful.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stop here. 121 to 129 is, as the subtitle says, is about the Battle of Badr,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">which, I think, it is the first battle that Muhammad and his followers had to fight against disbelievers. God is reminding Muhammad that when you</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were assigning people in the position for battle, they knew that they are going to attack them in their town, that community that they had, and there were this bunch of, this group of</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">believers with the prophet, and they were ready to defend. And of course, it seems that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">not all of those people were at the same level of belief. There were some who were better believers, they were stronger believers, and maybe there were people who had some</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">some doubts in how far or how much God can help them. So, God is reminding Muhammad that when you</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were assigning your people for the positions for the battle, two groups of you almost failed,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and God was their Lord. Although two groups of you failed, since I don&#39;t know the exact</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">history of the Battle of Badr, I don&#39;t know if this failure is in the real battle</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that they went out and fought and failed, or they failed the test, because this was a test of</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">how much you believe. Imagine that something happens outside, you know, now we have to go</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and put our lives, say, okay, this is for God, and God wants us to go and fight these people who are attacking this mosque.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then, that&#39;s the real test. This is one of the most precious things that you like, is your life. You have to go and risk your life</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in the cause of God, you know, it is for God. So, it seems that if people have different</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">levels of belief, some people may doubt it, say &quot;is this real battle? Is this really Muhammad, right, that this is for God?&quot; And then you question.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And God is saying that two groups of you almost failed in that,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">because those people didn&#39;t trust or didn&#39;t believe that God can help them with his angels.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then, God is saying in 123, that [3:123] GOD gave you victory at Badr, even though you were weak.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you know, outnumbered, weaker, maybe the other side had better arsenal. And God is reminding them that you shall observe God to show your</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">appreciation. He helped you. He made you victorious over the disbelievers, and you should remember, you have to always remember God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[3:124] You told the believers, &quot;Is it not enough that your Lord supports you with three thousand angels?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[3:125] Yes, if you steadfastly persevere and maintain righteousness, then they attack you suddenly, your Lord will supply you with five thousand angels, well trained.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This clearly shows that how a believer, as Rashad just very, I think, beautifully put it, if you are a believer, you have so much strength, you have something you</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that even at the everyday life causes that strength. It shows in your system. You know, you walk, you talk with more strength, with self-confidence, because</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">as was mentioned in today&#39;s Khutba. Since you believe in God, you believe in someone Who is the Superior Force, who is the Creator of the whole universe.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, you see everybody else the same. You don&#39;t worry about your boss. You don&#39;t worry about anything. You, your soul has grown so big,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hopefully, that if you go in a room with some disbelievers, then there is not enough room, they just get pushed, they get squished.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, and that&#39;s the time that God comes to your help. You go in a community and you see that. This reminds me of a story that I was told, I don&#39;t know whether I told you this or not.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tariq is here. I was talking to his parents, because they are Muslims. And they were saying that the first time they were exposed to Islam,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">through Elijah Muhammad, in Brooklyn, New York, before that they were just normal people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were always thought that they are inferior to other people and so on and so forth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But when they went through and they were introduced into what was told to them that this is Islam,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">whatever it was, that there is a God, Allah, you have to follow Him, you believe in Him, and if you follow that, you do your prayers, then you are strong. And they were saying that after they even got that close to the real thing, which is believing in God,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">which then, as we know the history of the black Muslim movement in this country, which I&#39;m sure</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Douglas is in a better position to tell us about it, but the thing that was interesting</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to me was the strength that they said they felt with this. They said that all of a sudden</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they felt that God is giving them so much strength that they would go to places that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they never imagined that they could go. They would go to places which were drug dealers</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with shotguns, you know, and they were saying that they would go to these places, and all of these</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">nastiest people in the world that live in that area were afraid of them. Even they had shotguns, even they had knives, even whatever. And that shows, this is an example, but God</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is telling us exactly that if you believe in Him, He&#39;s going to support you. The angels,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the numbers that are given here, which in the footnote, you can see that the numbers that are in the Quran are multiple of 19. God is giving these numbers and telling us that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in everyday life and also in the real battles that have happened in the past, and</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">may happen in other forms. It doesn&#39;t have to be battles that you fight with bombs and</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">guns and so on. Everyday battle with believers, which nowadays is mostly through, through communications,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">then God is going to help you to be winners. 126,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[3:126] GOD gives this you good news, to assure your hearts. Victory comes only from GOD, the Almighty, Most Wise.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is the reassurance that God has given us, the good news. [3:127] He thus annihilates some disbelievers, or neutralizes them; so they end up in failure.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[3:128] It is not up to you; He may redeem them, or punish them for their sins.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After you have done your work, you have done your job, it is not up to you.

So, you have to do your homework,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you have to do your job.

Are there any questions before I say that? First of all, I urge you or encourage you to go to any public library</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and look up the Encyclopedia Britannica under Badr. B A D R. And in the Encyclopedia Britannica they give you</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:29:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the numbers of equipment on both sides, the disbelievers and the believers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:29:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you can see according to those numbers from history, that the disbelievers vastly outnumber the believers for at least ten times as much in every category.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:29:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean seventy camels against seven things, actually more than that. Look it up in the Encyclopedia Britannica.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:29:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then you look at the outcome of this battle and they say that militarily</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:29:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it doesn&#39;t make sense. The outcome doesn&#39;t make sense. Of course, they couldn&#39;t count the invisible force of the three thousand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:29:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you don&#39;t see the three thousand angels on the side of the believers.

Did they describe the believers and disbelievers? The messenger: Yes, they described the Muhammad side and the pagan side.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:29:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: It&#39;s quite fair, what I read. It was many years ago when I read it. They</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:30:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible). The messenger: So, just go and look for it in any public library, in Encyclopedia Britannica, under Badr and you&#39;ll see this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:30:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: It&#39;s in the history of Islam also, the life of the Prophet Muhammad. The messenger: See, Britannica is a neutral, it pretends to be neutral.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:30:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the history of Islam, we&#39;ll see they&#39;re biased.

The first verse is 19 letters. The number of Suras is a multiple of 19.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first revelation was 19 words. The last revelation 19 words.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These are famous first revelations and famous last revelations.

Because I needed some support.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s very simple.

Is this difficult? I mean, the consistency and repetition of the number 19 is so simple.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet, nobody, there are a billion Muslims in the world, but none of them was allowed to</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">find these very simple facts unless they have heard the Quran alone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they believed in Hadith and Sunnah and mentioned other names in their prayer,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they are not permitted to touch it.

In that circle, the number begins with the first verse in the Quran, 1.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, if you look on the left, there is an asterisk on the left side of the circle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you see, right, we start by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. These are the verses of the first Sura, 7 verses.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Followed by the total number of verses in the Sura, which is 7. Then you move on to the next Sura, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, all the way to 286,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the number of verses in Sura 2. Then you put the total number of verses in Sura two, 286. And you do this all the way to the end of the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When you get to the end of the Quran, if you look on the right side, you see this big arrow that says total number of verses in the Quran. You put that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, you have a very long number, that is, I like it in the metric system, it&#39;s one kilometer long.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it consists of 12,696 digits. And it is a multiple of 19.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you go on, if you see now, if you look on the right side of the circle, in the middle of it,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with the big arrow that says total number of verses in the Quran, after the asterisk comes the total number of verses in the first Sura, which is 7.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And next to it, the 7 verses, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Then, you put the total number of verses in Sura number 2, and so on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, what we&#39;re doing in the lower half is we are reversing the position of the total number of verses. Instead putting it at the end of every Sura, we are putting it at the</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">beginning of every Sura. And brothers and sisters, the number is divisible when you go to the end.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So now, this is a circle, and connect the two numbers, you have what was, until</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">yesterday, the day before yesterday, the longest number in the world, 25,388 digits.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that&#39;s a multiple of 19. Now, what Abdullah did to make this number obsolete, he added the number of every Sura.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay, let&#39;s go now to the asterisk on the left side of the circle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It begins with the numbers of the verses of the first Sura, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, followed by the total number of verses in this Sura, which is 7.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, between the two 7s there, he put the number of the Sura, 1. And he did this with every Sura, and you guessed it, the number is still divisible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s just incredible. And there is more. If you put the number of the Sura at the beginning, or at the end, or in the middle,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it&#39;s still divisible. So, this will be in the Ramadan issue. In the Muslim perspective, you&#39;re gonna get more details.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So now, I don&#39;t know how many digits there are from the first Sura to the last Sura, the numbers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">1, 2, 3, 4, you counted the digits. 114, from the Sura 1, Sura 2, Sura 3, Sura 4, all the way to Sura 114.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Do you know how many digits?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">474. You add that. A man: Why are you adding 1 and 2 and 3 up to 114?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: That&#39;s because you put them next to each other, not adding This, this is a by-the-way miracle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">1, 2, 3, 4 all the way to the end of the Quran, 114. We&#39;re putting the digits next to each other.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">474 digits and it&#39;s a multiple of 19. So, you put that, you add this to this number which is 25,696. You add 474. Now, we have the biggest number in the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it is out of this Quran. 2, 4, 25, 3, 88, plus 4 is 70</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it&#39;s about 25,800 numbers, digits.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is divisible. A woman: Can you put it through at the beginning or at the end, or in the middle?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: In the middle, meaning between the last verse and the total number of verses. If you look on the left side of the circle, you see the asterisk.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And above it, you see the number of verses in Sura Al-F&atilde;tehah, number 1. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Followed by the total number of verses in the Sura, which is another 7. So, if you put the 1 between the two 7s that you see there, that&#39;s the number of the Sura,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you do this in all the Suras, it&#39;s divisible. If you move the number of the Sura and put it at the beginning, so you have 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s divisible. And if you put the total number of verses at the beginning, so you have 1, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You still have a divisible number. So, it sounds like almost a physical impossibility, but it locks every verse.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Somebody called today and said, how do you know it&#39;s only the two verses in Sura 9? If you notice that Sura 9 is mentioned here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you look at the upper right corner of the circle, it says &quot;total number of verses in Sura 9.&quot; You have to use 127.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This fellow was calling from Louisville, Kentucky, and he said &quot;how do you know it&#39;s only the two verses in Sura 9 that violate the code?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I told him, because every single verse, what we see here is every single verse in the Quran is authenticated as Divine from God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Every single one, except these two. So, it is fitting to mention why God swears by the position of the stars that this is a Quran KARIM.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way, Al-Quran Al-Karim has a numerical value that&#39;s 684, a multiple of 19.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The numerical value of this, the official name of the Quran, Al-Quran Al-Karim.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just to change the subject and make it a little bit light-footed. Do you know how they count the stars?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m sure some of you do. But anyway, they go out in the night and take a picture of the sky.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They just take a picture. They put it in a computer, and the computer will count the number of stars in that area, in that picture.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there&#39;s a formula that tells you what the circumference from the inside of a circle is.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then you can tell from this picture how many are in the whole circumference of the whole sky.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you do this a hundred times, and then you take the average of the hundred times, and you have exactly, almost exactly, the number of stars, A billion trillion of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And these are the ones that we see. Because of this, if our Sun is in the next galaxy, we will not be able to see it, because it is one of the dim stars.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What you see are only the bright stars.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is how we counted them. [56:75] I swear by the positions of the stars.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because they are in perfect position, in perfect orbits. They don&#39;t crash into one another.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was something else, I also wanted to mention here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think this is it. Are there any questions?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: I&#39;m not sure. If you have two numbers, what is the quantity of (unintelligible)?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right, right. We have two halves that are divisible by 19. So, what I&#39;m doing here is just making them into a circle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, the upper half is a multiple of 19, and you have the total number of verses at the end of each Sura.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The lower half is a multiple of 19, and the connecting them has nothing to do with anything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But in the lower half, you have the number of verses at the beginning of every Sura. If you look on the right side of the circle, look at the right side of the circle at the</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">big arrow that says total number of verses in the Quran. Below that, you see Sura Al-F&atilde;tehah with the total number of verses, which is 7, at the beginning, not at the end.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, you have 7,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 instead of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Both of them are independently divisible by 19. I just put them next to each other.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it&#39;s because the upper half was a discovery by Feroz Karmally in Canada.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he ended up putting the total number of verses in the Quran at the end of the number.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The lower half is Abdullah&#39;s discovery, and the total number of verses comes ahead of the Sura.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the total number of verses in the Quran fits right there ahead of the whole Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I put it in a circle. This circle is now obsolete. Great, but obsolete. We have better circles now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lisa: It&#39;s a sphere.

By the way, the verse goes on and says &#1573;&#1616;&#1606;&#1614;&#1617;&#1607;&#1615;&#1765; &#1605;&#1616;&#1606;&#1618; &#1593;&#1616;&#1576;&#1614;&#1575;&#1583;&#1616;&#1606;&#1614;&#1575; &#1649;&#1604;&#1618;&#1605;&#1615;&#1582;&#1618;&#1604;&#1614;&#1589;&#1616;&#1610;&#1606;&#1614; (12:24) that he was one of our devoted servants.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Believers who were &ldquo;swept in the crowd.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because he was one of God&#39;s devoted servants, God diverted him from, protected him from sin.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, what I&#39;m saying is that when we agreed with Satan billions of years ago,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">some of us were swept in the crowd. And God knew that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is what God meant when He said to the angels, the angels said &quot;put them all in Hell.&quot; And God said &quot;I know what you do not know.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, God knows that we were swept in the crowd, some of us were swept in the crowd, and do not deserve to go to Hell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is why God granted Abraham his understanding. God granted you the fortune to come across the true message, to worship Him alone and upholding His word alone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s not because you&#39;re clever, or because I&#39;m smart. It&#39;s because apparently God, not apparently, obviously, God knew that some of us were swept</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in the crowd somehow, and we agreed with Satan, and we deserve the chance to come here to be redeemed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the people who are taken, like Martin Luther King, taken only a few months before his 40th birthday.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Malcolm X, being taken two months before his birthday, his 40th birthday.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And all the other signs that we have seen. In fact, if you look at verse 41, where you&#39;re holding the book now, you see 41 is the beginning of Hell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, those of you who make the decision, if you look at the previous Sura, verse 41,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we know from this circle here that these numbers of verses are designed, divinely designed for a reason.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we have all these mathematical proofs. Once you get into the age of 41, you better be worshipping God alone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just a second. I don&#39;t wanna forget what I&#39;m saying. So, had God left Martin Luther King to live beyond the age of 40, he would have been swept,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that&#39;s the word that brought me to Khutba two weeks from now. Whether being swept by his environment and his circumstances into, maybe, mentioning Jesus and things like that,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for so long he was a pastor in a church, I think, but in his heart, and even vocally,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he never said anything about Jesus. Not that I heard of, in his vast amount of recordings, he always talked about God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is why God chose to take him, at that time, to protect him from going beyond</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to this number 41, and be swept by his environment and his circumstances into Christianity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it will be like we see here on verse 90, [56:90] And if he [belongs with those on] the right&mdash; [56:91] [then] peace [to you from] those on the right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you can be sure that God&#39;s justice put these people exactly in the right place.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He deserves to be in the Lower Heaven. When Satan made that blasphemy billions of years ago, there were degrees of convictions among us</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to go from the jinns who completely agreed with Satan, to the majority of humans who</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were wishy-washy, to some who were swept in the crowd. And hopefully that&#39;s us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, now Kathy has a question.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kathy: And I want to go to the earlier verses, I have a question about the conversation from the entire Heaven. It&#39;s obvious we are the later generation now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: We are the first generation. Kathy: Ok. The messenger: You were not here last week, were you? That&#39;s what you get for missing a Friday.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kathy: I had one or two episodes. The messenger: I was just explaining to you why you missed that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Description of &ldquo;special&rdquo; and &ldquo;first generation&rdquo; Believers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kathy: Is there going to be another two generations from this generation or two generations, the higher generation here?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: OK, you&#39;re talking about the very special group of people who will be in the closet to God on the Day of Judgment and they are very special people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this will be like when the Prophet Muhammad started to preach... Well, let&#39;s go to Abraham. Abraham started Islam.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then there were people who were with him when the others would throw him in the fire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then by the time the Prophet Muhammad came, they became idol worshippers. Then, the message was renewed by revealing the Quran through the Prophet Muhammad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he was secretly preaching. And there were people with him. Those are very special people. This is the first generation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then Muhammad became victorious and he opened Mecca and all the people in Mecca became believers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They jumped in the wagon. But they do not deserve the same credit as the people who were with him when he was being</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">persecuted and having stones thrown at him and he was cast and called names and persecuted.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Does this make sense? So that was a first generation at the time of Abraham, at the time of Muhammad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then ten years ago, Islam was totally corrupted. There is not a single mosque in the world that upholds the commandment to mention only</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the name of God in the mosque, in the worship practices and so on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then God renewed the message with this miracle. So, now we are a first generation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the people who are in this movement, while it is being persecuted and the names and the</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">insults and so on, are very special people. Now, ten years from now, we will probably have millions, maybe twenty years, fifty years from now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And everybody will jump in the wagon, but they do not deserve the same credit as you do. So, these very special people will be multitudes from this generation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After that, when it is famous and successful and it is the thing to do, they don&#39;t deserve the same credit. They will not be in the same rank.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is what we did last week when you were absent.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Any questions? A man: The thing between age 40 and the stuff that is related to the messenger being at age 40. The messenger: No.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: We don&#39;t even know if he was really 40 or not. They didn&#39;t have birth certificates then. They&#39;re just guessing that the Prophet was 40 when he was awakened and given the Quran. But it has nothing to do with that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is in the Quran, in Sura 46, verse 15, it says...it&#39;s what it says.

There&#39;s no way they can do it. God puts terror in their hearts, and you just hear Exodus, they just left their homes on their own accord.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were terrified, because it&#39;s not them. It&#39;s not up to them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, they had to leave their homes on their own.

And they had to leave.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is, you read in the Quran consistently, that God&#39;s system does not change.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&#39;s an invisible giant standing by you to protect you, to serve you, to tell you &quot;I&#39;m your friend.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And to go with your children wherever they go.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You have grown up girls, don&#39;t think they are not chaperones, they are chaperones.

I mean, we are living the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even if God did not decree exodus for them, He would have punished them in this life anyway.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because those who sided against God, they just have no chance. The Quran repeatedly says &quot;do not be impressed by their apparent successes, their apparent temporary successes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their very success becomes the source of their misery in this world. They&#39;re not happy. Do not be impressed by their apparent successes if they are successful.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I hope I&#39;m impressing on you enough that you have confidence in God that He is sending His forces with you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Quran consistently talks about invisible soldiers. These invisible soldiers, they are with the believers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the problem with those people out there in the street, they don&#39;t believe in the invisible. They only believe in the visible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And our visible range is very limited, by the way. In fact, this light, the visible range, there are only seven colors? Seven colors in the visible range.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it&#39;s a very narrow range. Beyond that, we don&#39;t see. And there are things that we know exist. The X-rays exists. The ultraviolet exists.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ultra is on one end, and the X-rays is on the other end. No, excuse me, they&#39;re both on the same end, but the X-rays are shorter than UV. Infrared is on the other side. You do not see the infrared.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We were talking about the infrared one time, and we said &quot;you can take a picture of that couch after David and Frank leave, and you&#39;ll see them there, after they leave.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if one of them punches the other in the face, we&#39;ll know who punched who. After they leave, because of the infrared.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the UV and X-rays are invisible. UV is what hits you when you sit in the sun too long.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we&#39;re all aware of the X-rays. We don&#39;t see them, but they are powerful.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is just a tiny sample of the invisibles. You have an invisible giant standing by you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If somebody comes to punch you on the nose, you can imagine what will happen to them. Unless you deserve it. Then, the punch will come through. Measured.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Spoils of war &ndash; abused Verse 59:7, Sects of Islam.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The spoils of war. Of course, only the strong, young, powerful, able will go to war, and they will get spoils of war.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, God is saying, to be fair and distribute them at least one-fifth of them must go out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the Shia sect, they take advantage of this one-fifth business.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it is common in the Shia village that a man with a black turban will go to the house</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and say &quot;give me one-fifth of everything you own. I&#39;m a descendant of the Prophet.&quot; And they would give him one-fifth of everything they own. This is what some people told me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#1582;&#1605;&#1587; they call it. One-fifth. So, it is a misinterpretation of this law for abuse.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of the most abused verses in the Quran is verse 7, where it says, whatever</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the Messenger gives you, you shall take, and whatever he forbids you, do not take.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It has to do with the spoils of war, but they make it to mean Hadith and Sunnah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, there is abuse in all the sects of Islam, so-called sects. Of course, in Sura 6, verse 159, it says &quot;If you divide yourself into sects, you do not belong with God or with the messenger.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, both sects, the Sunnis and the Shias, are not Muslims. By their own admission. You ask &quot;what are you?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m a Sunni.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Who&#39;s gonna say that in the Day of Judgment? &quot;What are you?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m a Sunni.&quot; &quot;What are you?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m a Shia.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You don&#39;t say Muslim. So, both of them abuse these verses in this particular Sura.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you know something? I do go along with them. I say &quot;okay, what the messenger gives you, take, and what he forbids you, don&#39;t take.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He gave you the Quran. He uttered only the Quran. So, even though they abuse the verse, I do go along with them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Are there any questions on this? Are you gonna forget that you have an invisible giant behind you?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And with your kids, with your affairs. Don&#39;t forget that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay, we&#39;ll go back to verse 9, Donna</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Donna: [59:9] As for those who provided them with a home and a refuge, and were believers before them, they love those who immigrated to them, and find no hesitation in their hearts in helping them. In fact, they readily give them priority over themselves, even when they themselves need what they give away. Indeed, those who overcome their natural stinginess are the successful ones.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[59:10] Those who became believers after them say, &quot;Our Lord, forgive us and our brethren who preceded us to the faith, and keep our hearts from harboring any hatred towards those who believed.

But then it says, to remove any hatred from their heart. Ok?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the believers should always hang together.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay, there was... what is it? There&#39;s a verse. I wrote it down, 3:103.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sura 3, 103.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[3:103] You shall hold fast to the rope of GOD, all of you, and do not be divided. Recall GOD&#39;s blessings upon you&mdash;you used to be enemies and He reconciled your hearts. By His grace, you became brethren. You were at the brink of a pit of fire, and He saved you therefrom. GOD thus explains His revelations for you, that you may be guided.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the believers should be united, you know, and there shouldn&#39;t be hatred.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we should ask God, you know, to help us, you know, not be enemies or to remove any hatred between us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, it goes on to verse 11. The hypocrites said to their allies...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Let me give you a little rest here on these two verses, 9 and 10.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah, I want to... this gives me a chance to thank God and be proud of something that our community has done. It&#39;s a perfect example of living the Quran. You all know Emily.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She works Friday nights, unfortunately, but soon God will give her time to work here. But she packed everything in New York and she moved here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And she had, there was a period of time when she was looking for a job. And she had no means of support.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I tell you, during all this time when she needed help, this drawer was full of envelopes with Emily&#39;s name on it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">People were pitching in and helping her. And she kept her on her feet until she was standing on her own feet.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know who all those people are, but, you know, we&#39;re a small community. We&#39;re not wealthy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But this drawer had enough support for Emily. There were sealed envelopes with her name on it. And I passed them on to her and that helped her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just like she didn&#39;t feel bad. But this is an example of immigrants who joined the believers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the people who are established helped them. And I know, I mean, this is not the only example. I was giving good examples.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This will always happen. This always happened in the past. And it happens naturally.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When you&#39;re a believer, God guides you into doing these things. So, I just wanted to note this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And also I want to go back to the protection and give you, I think we learn best by the real-life examples of things that happened to us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m sure Lori will not mind mentioning her accident sometime back. But this is an example of an invisible giant who is with you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lori was in an accident. She was thrown out of the car.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then she took care of the driver. Her sister was driving. And her sister went to the hospital. Now, nothing happened to her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She took care of her sister. Now, if you&#39;re thrown out of a car, you will hit something or something will hit you. But no, nothing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, you can imagine the invisible giant was carrying her outside in perfect safety.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this was a nearby track record. There are many, many examples. That was one of them. Real-life examples.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we thank God for teaching us the real-life and through the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Go ahead. A man: It says, removing our hearts from hatred toward believers. What&#39;s it saying there?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Which verse is this? 10? That&#39;s for the immigrants who came later to Islam.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">God removes hatred from hearts of believers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They say &quot;our Lord, forgive us and forgive those who preceded us to Islam. Remove from our hearts any hatred for us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These were people who were fighting each other. They were trying to kill each other.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then the disbelievers became believers and joined the camp of them. And these are people who killed my brother, my cousin, my father in war.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were engaged in war. And now they joined. I mean, they know that this guy killed my father or this guy killed my brother.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And now he&#39;s a believer. And God did remove hatred from their hearts and they became like a family.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, you have to take (unintelligible) to those days and understand what was going on. A woman: Rashad, even today, we hear so much in the news that&#39;s bad, negative about Muslims, that in this</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">culture, in this country, you can come to think of Muslims as being horrible people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then God chooses to guide you to this. Then, all of a sudden you know the difference and have that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible) But it is easy to have a wrong impression on Islam due to the so-called Muslims. The messenger: Exactly. Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: They did a good job giving Islam a bad name. A woman: Yes. The messenger: I don&#39;t really blame the Americans.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Donna: But also, it doesn&#39;t have to be a deep-seated hatred. It can be just differences between people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&#39;s always gonna be differences between, well, just personalities.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, you know, you&#39;ve kind of gotta make compromises and so forth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the believers are united and stay together as a family.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: It&#39;s a very nice prayer. (Unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Donna: Okay, are we ready to go on? Okay. [59:11] Have you noted those who are plagued with hypocrisy, and how they said to their companions in disbelief among the people of the scripture, &quot;If you are evicted we will go out with you, and will never obey anyone who opposes you. If anyone fights you, we will fight on your side.&quot; GOD bears witness that they are liars.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[59:12] In fact, if they were evicted, they would not have gone out with them, and if anyone fought them, they would not have supported them. Even if they supported them, they would have turned around and fled. They could never win.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[59:13] Indeed, you strike more terror in their hearts than their fear of GOD. This is because they are people who do not comprehend.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[59:14] They do not get together to fight you unless they are in well-shielded buildings, or behind walls. Their might appears formidable among themselves. You would think that they are united, when in fact their hearts are divided. This is because they are people who do not understand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[59:15] Their fate is the same as their counterparts who preceded them. They suffered the consequences of their decisions. They have incurred a painful retribution.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[59:16] They are like the devil: he says to the human being, &quot;Disbelieve,&quot; then as soon as he disbelieves, he says, &quot;I disown you. I fear GOD, Lord of the universe.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[59:17] The destiny for both of them is the Hellfire, wherein they abide forever. This is the requital for the transgressors.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;ll go back to verse 11, here. And this set of verses is talking about hypocrites and disbelievers and lump them together.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the hypocrites are saying to the disbelievers &quot;okay. we are with you, we are with you.&quot; You know. And you know, &quot;we&#39;ll go with you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they do get banished, they don&#39;t go with them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hypocrites, you know, they stay in one place. They&#39;re just hypocrites. You know, that&#39;s the reason God has saved the best place in Hell for them</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">because they don&#39;t go with that group, they don&#39;t go with that group. You know, they just stay on the fence post.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ok. And they fear everybody else, the hypocrites do,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">instead of God, as they should. They are worried about what everybody else is gonna think about them, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We wanna be with this group, but we wanna be with this group. It doesn&#39;t work that way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ok. And they won&#39;t fight. It says in verse 14, they won&#39;t fight unless they are behind some big wall, thinking that that&#39;s gonna protect them, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you already found out over here, in the first set of verses, that, you know, it doesn&#39;t protect you from God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If God&#39;s will is for them to be destroyed, then nothing will protect them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Also in this verse 14, it says you would think they were united, but in reality, they are all divided.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, it&#39;s just like the Muslims now. You think they&#39;re all one group, especially the Christians, that don&#39;t know anything about Islam. You know, they think all Muslims.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, there&#39;s a whole lot of them. There&#39;s a whole lot of them. You know, they are striking terror and everything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But there is Sunnis, there is whatever.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can&#39;t even think of them all. You know, even between those, they are fighting. And one guy believes something and one guy believes something else.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, and that&#39;s one reason why it&#39;s nice for the believers to be united</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">because, I mean, the way they are so divided, one united group of believers is more than this divided group and this divided group, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It also shows their disbelief and their arrogance. They always wanna follow their own way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so, you know, it&#39;s like a two-step this morning, you know. They kick each other&#39;s butt.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: What are the causes for human being to be a hypocrite?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: The causes? A man: The choice, is it by himself or herself, given to him by God? Why the person chooses to be a hypocrite?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Hypocrisy is lack of belief. The belief is not there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And what they&#39;re doing is going along with whatever group they&#39;re with.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, they&#39;re really worshipping their own ego. A man: Is it a choice that they&#39;re making on their own? The messenger: Yes, of course.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: It&#39;s a choice that they&#39;re making. A man: So, why some are making, some are not? Is there anything with God, or genetically or naturally or is there any second power behind their mind?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: It&#39;s a conclusion that they reach on their own. It&#39;s a decision they make.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We study our surroundings, and we look at the universe around us, and we decide to believe</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in God, disbelieve in God, or go along with the crowd, wherever we are. So, these are the three kinds of people:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Definition of a hypocrite.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">believers, disbelievers, and hypocrites.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: &#1605;&#1580;&#1575;&#1607;&#1583;&#1740;&#1606; &#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1606;&#1575;&#1601;&#1602;&#1740;&#1606;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Yeah, they&#39;re called Mojahedin Khalq (&#1605;&#1580;&#1575;&#1607;&#1583;&#1740;&#1606; &#1582;&#1604;&#1602;)? A man: Yeah, those are the people, they&#39;re confused. They say they are Mohajed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: .... to the time of Muhammad...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: What are the definition of a person.... Mojahed and Munafiq?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Ok. The definition of a hypocrite is one who says that he&#39;s a believer when in his or her heart are not believers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They say they are believers, and usually they don&#39;t know that they&#39;re not believers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, God gives us criteria in the Quran. For example,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I know now for a fact that they are forbidden by God from saying &quot;La Elaha Ella Allah&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">without saying &quot;Muhammad Rasulallah.&quot; I mean, I did my own experiments.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I used my education to run some experiments, and I find it true.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, the last time I challenged the person, I said &quot;you are forbidden by God from saying La Elaha Ella Allah.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he could not say &quot;La Elaha Ella Allah&quot; without saying &quot;Muhammad Rasulallah.&quot; He was unable to say it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, here&#39;s a person who claims to be a believer, but he&#39;s not. So, God gives us the criteria.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of them is when God alone is mentioned, they don&#39;t like it. When Muhammad is mentioned with him, or somebody else is mentioned with God, then they like it. This is in Sura 39, verse 45.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, there are criteria in the Quran that will tell the person whether he or she is a believer or not.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the definition, now a disbeliever is one who says he doesn&#39;t believe. That&#39;s a disbeliever.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the Quran writes about them two verses. But a hypocrite is one who says that he or she is a believer when they are not believers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is why the Quran writes 13 verses about them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because they are more damaging than the disbelievers. The disbeliever, you know, you know the position.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the hypocrite is a person who claims to be a believer. What can you do?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They didn&#39;t call themselves Munafiqun. They never called themselves Munafiqun.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&#39;s nobody on earth who thinks that he or she is going to Hell. But we know from the Quran that the majority of people are going to Hell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: Dr. Khalifa... The messenger: First, before you say anything, I confused you with Mohsen Bilyani.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: Oh, Really? The messenger: I called you Mohsen. I forget your name. Hamid: Because you just... it&#39;s okay if you confuse me with Mohsen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: You say you and Mohsen are very close. So, well, do you wanna introduce yourself?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Why did you come with him here? The messenger: Yeah, I know. The messenger: I just discovered recently that I confused you with Mohsen. That I called you Mohsen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: But your name is? Hamid: He&#39;s not here. The messenger: Yeah, he is here. Hamid: Is he? The messenger: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I just saw him the other day. This is when I said &quot;hey, wait a minute. This is Mohsen.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: Doctor, I&#39;m not losing my hair. The guy doesn&#39;t have any...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Give me your name first. Hamid: I&#39;m Hamid. The messenger: Hamid, okay. The messenger: Go ahead.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: Now, going back to our discussion, does Quran categorize the hypocrites worse than non-believers? The messenger: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: Is that the reason that there are more verses about them? The messenger: Yes. The messenger: Yeah, there&#39;s a statement in Sura 4 that says the hypocrites are in the lowest pit of Hell. Hamid: Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Now, a good example of the hypocrites, if I may say so, is Khomeini, for example. Hamid: Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: He&#39;s a person who thinks he&#39;s the leader of the Islamic revolution. Hamid: He&#39;s the biggest hypocrite of all. The messenger: Exactly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: But he really, he believes, he sincerely believes that he is a believer. But he doesn&#39;t act according to the Quran. Hamid: You know what?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Go ahead. Hamid: Basically, my brother was mentioning about what was going on in Iran. They use it in their own benefit. And I think the line is very fine line.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s sometimes even confusing for the ordinary people to really recognize that, you know, who is who, and which is which.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that makes it a little bit, unfortunately, hard.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sometimes very painful and costly, like what we are witnessing in the case of, you know, what they offer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: No, the Quran definitely says that the hypocrites are worse in the lowest pit of Hell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cause here, I mean, before the whole world, the whole world looks at them as Muslims. They&#39;re acting in the name of Islam.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, the last four weeks, they executed 400 people in Iran because of drugs, supposedly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: Yesterday, according to BBC, 85 people, yesterday alone was executed The messenger: Yes. This makes it 400 in 4 weeks. Now, the trial takes one week.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, I mean, they don&#39;t, maybe some of these people are insane. Maybe they have pain and they need to take drugs. Actually, they don&#39;t even take drugs. This is the name of Islam.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Parivash: No, I had a letter from my mom. And she said that was the worst. And the drug dealer, they were anywhere. They saw them in any street anywhere.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they were so scared because they had young kids. And they were so scared because of this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they don&#39;t like somebody was killed because of that. But I had another letter. They said &quot;yeah, when they killed some of these, at least they can&#39;t see it anywhere, these drug dealers.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that&#39;s because we are here. We don&#39;t know. That&#39;s what my mom doesn&#39;t, she&#39;s not in this, any politics or anything of this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was the letter I have from her. And we don&#39;t, we are here. And we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going over there. If they keep, the drug is over there because of this situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Drug addicts and dealers &ndash; Quran does not advocate the killing of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because the young people, they don&#39;t have anything over there. And the drug is all over there in the country. And this is easy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When you wanna buy a drug, it&#39;s cheaper than if you buy a cigarette, a pack of cigarettes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: You&#39;re talking about hashish? Parivash: No, heroin. The messenger: Heroin. Parivash: Yeah, that&#39;s the worst thing. When you can buy it, cheaper than that...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: It&#39;s all over the place. Parivash: Yeah, it&#39;s all over the place. The messenger: But who said that drug addicts or drug dealers should be killed? Parivash: That is not from the Islam.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Parivash: They do it because they want to save...I don&#39;t know. I am not talking about... The messenger: To save the country. Praivash: To save the country.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: The country needs to be saved from them. Parivash: I don&#39;t know. That is not something...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When you are living over there, you have kids. You wanna protect them. The messenger: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: From heroin? Parivash: Yeah, this is one of the worst things, I think. Hamid: Well, ironically, you have written... I&#39;m sorry, I just don&#39;t wanna interrupt you. This business actually may be a waster of time for some other person The messenger: No, no, go ahead.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: But the situation is really worsening every day. And we hear, here, also.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We know Iran is going through its darkest period right at this time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And hopefully we will come out of it, IN SHAA ALLAH The messenger: IN SHAA ALLAH. Hamid: But It was even mentioned in one of the regime&#39;s newspapers that one family sold their daughter and son in the southern part of Iran next to Pakistan.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He sold, because he was addicted to heroin, he sold his daughter for 35,000 Toman and</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for his son 35,000 Toman and his daughter for 5,000 Toman which is probably like $250</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to $200 just to give an app.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: This is a regime newspaper. I don&#39;t know if I believe it or not. Hamid: Well, I&#39;m saying once in a while they can&#39;t even...It is happening. This is one man from a hundred. But, you know, they can&#39;t really deny the whole thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They try to minimize it, but it is really... The messenger: It&#39;s a mess anyway. Hamid: It is so a mess</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">even the United States told its allies not to give this government the money that they wanted. But it is very unstable.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Maybe this proceeds true Islam. True Islam will come to Iran, IN SHAA ALLAH.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: And one more, just a second. 10% of the population will be addicted to drugs. 5 million, according to the United States.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: They&#39;re addicted to drugs? Hamid: 10% of the whole population. The whole country.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Well, I don&#39;t know. A woman: 10% of the young people, not the old people. This is the whole thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Well, 10 or 15% of the Egyptians have been smoking hashish for the last three years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: And nothing has happened to them. This is their problem. A man: Why is nothing happening to them? The messenger: Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Okay, back to Donna and verse 12. Donna: 13 Donna: Well, I&#39;d like to point out that we refer to verse 16 where it says that Satan says</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;disbelieve&quot; and then he says, when, you know, then when the person disbelieves, he says &quot;okay, you know, I fear God myself, you know.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t have anything to do with you, you know. A man: Bye. Donna: And it&#39;s a very strong verse. I would like to point that out. And we refer to it quite often.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Satan himself knows who really controls things, and he fears himself. Okay.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And on to verse 18. [59:18] O you who believe, you shall reverence GOD, and let every soul examine what it has sent ahead for tomorrow. You shall reverence GOD; GOD is fully Cognizant of everything you do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[59:19] Do not be like those who forgot GOD, so He made them forget themselves. These are the wicked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[59:20] Not equal are the dwellers of the Hellfire and the dwellers of Paradise; the dwellers of Paradise are the winners.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay. As Muslims, even on a daily basis or even every hour or moment, every time you can remember,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">think about what we&#39;re doing, you know. Make sure that it&#39;s what God wants, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And make sure that we&#39;re on the right track.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And our prayers help us do that, you know. By praying, we get back on the right track and back to thinking about God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It keeps us from falling into sin. And then in verse 19, it says &quot;Do not be like those who forgot God.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&#39;s a verse in the (unintelligible) that we say all the time, you know &quot;remember God so that He may remember you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, if you forget God, it&#39;s like Abdullah was talking about one time and said &quot;you pick your own Lord&quot;, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you pick your job or whatever is the one that you occupy your mind with the most, well, you&#39;ve forgotten God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, that job becomes your God. That&#39;s the one you worry about, think about the most.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so when you think about something other than God, or I&#39;ll say &quot;if you occupy your mind with something other than God, then you forget to feed your own soul&quot;, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You aren&#39;t thinking about God so that He can help you in your daily life and you remember God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s just like an equation, you know. It&#39;s a balanced kind of equation. You remember God and He remembers you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You forget God and you starve your soul and you pick some other god other than God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And those that pick other gods, you know, are the losers in the Hereafter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their souls are starved and they won&#39;t be able to withstand the presence of God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And only those who have fed their souls and remembered God are gonna be the winners and be strong enough to be close to God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Donna: Ok. Are there any comments about those beautiful verses? The messenger: Any questions?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Verse 18, the Lord says &quot;for each one who examines what he or she has advanced for the coming day&quot;, we now understand...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we have to frequently examine where we stand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And hopefully each day, at the end of each day, we look at what we have done, whether it&#39;s in accordance with what God has commanded us, or we&#39;ve been breaking any laws,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">so that we don&#39;t get into the wishful thinking that we believe and we&#39;ll make it. We have to examine our actions frequently and see if we&#39;re in the right path because</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it&#39;s very easy to deviate from the right path and still think that we&#39;re being guided, but we may not be.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, and God gives us how we do that, like whether what we&#39;re doing is in accordance with the Quran and this is our guidance.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if we examine neutrally, what they&#39;re calling it, just look at what you&#39;ve done every day or every week, then you can see whether you&#39;re on the right path.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But a lot of people, they say they believe and they never think what they are doing. And that&#39;s what God is saying.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We should examine what we see or advance for the coming days because whatever we are doing is for the Hereafter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this world is temporary and we are working for the Hereafter and we have to examine what we&#39;re doing for the Hereafter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Right. Finished? Right. A man: Yes. A man: My question was aimed to the same verse. I guess...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know. I feel, I guess it&#39;s like, you know, where I will be faithful, you know, you can just get right on the side of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Analogy of working for this life Vs. working for the Hereafter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: That asking God for forgiveness in itself is an act of remembering God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I want to give you an analogy from this life, okay? Just think about what David Dixon is doing to guarantee a good life between the age of, say, 30 and 65, 35 years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He goes through school, and this applies to all of us, I&#39;m just using David as an example,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And because he&#39;s having such rough time, it&#39;s really rough, medical school is very difficult.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You go to school, grade school, junior high, high school, college, examinations, tests, staying up all night, homework, and this is to prepare for 35 or 40 years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, after that comes retirement, say 10, 20 years, for which people prepare their IRA, individual retirement account, and they&#39;re very worried, you know, what they will have.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay, what comes after that, after retirement? Let us say, not 40 years, let&#39;s say 40 million years. It&#39;s forever, 40 million years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, what are we doing for those 40 million years? For 40 years, you go through all this studying and homework and all this rough, you told me today it&#39;s rough, and every student now at the university knows how rough it is.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is just for 20 or 30 or 40 years. But God is telling us in this verse &quot;examine what you have advanced for the coming day, an eternal day.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The day of resurrection is an eternal day, 40 million years. How much are you going to need then?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In your 40 years here, you need, let&#39;s say $20,000 if you&#39;re really poor. $20,000 in 40 years is $800,000. This is what you need in this life.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And for these $800,000, you go to school and you work hard, and you&#39;re very polite to your teachers, so they give you a good grade, and they do anything they say.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Come here 3 o&#39;clock in the morning, we&#39;re having a special class.&quot; Then, you go at 3 o&#39;clock in the morning.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We&#39;re having a field trip.&quot; You&#39;ll go to the field trip. &quot;You study all night.&quot; You&#39;re gonna study all night.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You do all this for the $800,000 that you need in this world. Now for 40 million years, God told you exactly what to do for your PRA, post-retirement account.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You have to advance the funds for your PRA, the most important period of your life.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Every prayer, every Contact Prayer, God gives you, let&#39;s say, a million dollars. It&#39;s actually more than that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But God puts in your account a million dollars. And every time you remember God, you make a deposit.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, examine, and this verse here means you ask yourself every day &quot;how much does it put in my PRA account?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You must examine yourself every day, because on that day, when you wake up for the Day of Resurrection, you&#39;re gonna open your PRA book and say &quot;how much do I have?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That will decide what you&#39;re going to be for eternity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, here you go to school and you work very hard to have a nice, decent life here. You have to do the same for eternity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Are you gonna have a decent life there forever? Are you going to be an honored person? Are you gonna be a humiliated person?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is all in your hands. God left it up to you. You can make deposits as much as you want.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this world, when you get your check, you go to the bank and you make a deposit in your savings account or your bank account.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And God gave you infinite amount of deposits that you can make.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You have the five Prayers. There&#39;s the five deposits every day that you make in your account over there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it is literally, this is what it says &quot;O you who believe, beware of God, and let each of you examine what he or she has advanced for the coming day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How many deposits did you make today? Examine that. And then it tells you how to make the deposits.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You shall observe God. This is how, in the same verse. You observe God by doing the five, this is the minimum, the five daily prayers, by being honest, truthful, being kind to the people,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">being an exemplary person. For God is cognizant of everything you do, meaning, every deposit you make is gonna be multiplied many folds</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">because you&#39;re building up interest. God&#39;s interest is very high, 7000%. That&#39;s God&#39;s interest. That&#39;s the minimum, excuse me. Because God says &quot;He gives even more than that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the Quran puts things in perspective and makes us aware that the most important part of our life comes after death.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, the CD (Certificate of Deposit) account, and by the way, you can draw benefits now, not you can, you have to. You draw benefits now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think Hamid missed the part about the invisible giants that we have. This is part of the benefits that you draw. Because you benefit from the account right now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And 19 tells you &quot;do not be like those who forgot God.&quot; So again, it&#39;s telling you how to make deposits into your most important account, by remembering God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Do not be like those who forget God, then He makes them forget their own souls&quot;, meaning, they forgot to make deposits for their souls.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;re going to need that deposit when you get there, because you have the eternity ahead of you. And this is the only time you can make the deposits. Now is the only time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Over there it&#39;s too late. If somebody opens the account and there&#39;s zero in it, you can&#39;t come back here to make deposits. This is the only time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Are there any questions? The messenger: We&#39;ll go back to Donna and 21 or 20. Donna: 21. The messenger: 21.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Greatness of the Quran [59:21] If we revealed this Quran to a mountain, you would see it trembling, crumbling, out of reverence for GOD. We cite these examples for the people, that they may reflect.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[59:22] He is the One GOD; there is no other god besides Him. Knower of all secrets and declarations. He is the Most Gracious, Most Merciful.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[59:23] He is the One GOD; there is no other god besides Him. The King, the Most Sacred, the Peace, the Most Faithful, the Supreme, the Almighty, the Most Powerful, the Most Dignified. GOD be glorified; far above having partners.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[59:24] He is the One GOD; the Creator, the Initiator, the Designer. To Him belong the most beautiful names. Glorifying Him is everything in the heavens and the earth. He is the Almighty, Most Wise.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These verses are very strong verses, and they&#39;re my favorite verses. Me and Abdullah, we used to listen to these. We had a tape of them and we would listen to it every Ramadan.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These three verses always remind me of Ramadan. When we were younger and could stay up more at night, we would just listen to these. We would listen to these in the Arabic.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, you know, this Quran, you know, it&#39;s the word of God, and nothing can match it. And, you know, the mountain, it does what God wants it to do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it knows who God is. It knows the power of God. And it sounds kind of silly, but we should strive to be like the mountain, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think about how the angels, you know, it may sound a little bit funny, but you should try to be an angel, I mean, they do what God wants them to do. They&#39;re the ones that made the right decision in the first place.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they submit to God and do what God wants them to do. And you know, the mountain knows that, and angels know that. And God&#39;s trying to tell us, here, what to do, what He wants us to do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He spelled it out for us through what He calls here &quot;examples for people that they may reflect.&quot; This book is a no nonsense history. It&#39;s full of examples that we should learn from, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">History is useless unless you learn from it. And God&#39;s given us a concise but exact history here, and we should learn from it, learn to be like the mountain and the angels.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it says clearly here &quot;La Elaha Ella Allah.&quot; And there&#39;s nothing after it, except God&#39;s names here. And He knows all our intentions, all our secrets, all, He&#39;s all Knowing by definition, I know it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And when I was going to the U, in our philosophy class, we learned that God by definition is All Knowing, and All Powerful, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But people don&#39;t stop to think about that, you know. They don&#39;t even stop to think what God means. And so then, they get these things, well. &quot;We gotta help God, and we gotta do this for God&quot;, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God can&#39;t do it Himself, you know. But God by definition is All Knowing, and Almighty, and All Powerful, by definition alone. And then, it goes on to say He&#39;s Most Gracious, Most Merciful, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&#39;s given us a chance here on earth to, a second chance, you know, to do what&#39;s right, to be like the angels in the mountains, because we were so stupid in the beginning.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then again, it says &quot;La Elaha Ella Allah.&quot; And then, it goes on to name God&#39;s names again. And it says &quot;the King.&quot; And in our class, we taught the kids, you know, if</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">if God is your King, then wherever you, then you&#39;re always in God&#39;s Kingdom, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">if God is your king, you know, because God is everywhere, so wherever you are is God&#39;s Kingdom, as long as God is your King. He&#39;s the Sacred, the Peace. There&#39;s no peace without God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Happiness can only be achieved through God, and happiness is true peace inside. Oh, I skipped over the Sacred. He&#39;s, you know, the Highest, the Most Holy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then it says He&#39;s the Faithful, and if you turn to Sura 2, verse 186, it&#39;s a section on Ramadan, again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It says &quot;and when My servants ask you about Me, I am always near. I respond to the call of any caller who calls on Me. Therefore, they shall respond to Me, and believe in Me, that they may attain guidance.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God&#39;s always there when we need Him, you know. And, you know, He&#39;s just there to help us all the time. He&#39;s the Supreme. He&#39;s the Best, the Almighty, the Powerful, by definition, you know, and the Dignified.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We&#39;re told in the Quran that in the Hereafter, we&#39;ll be humble, because we&#39;re nothing compared to God, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All dignity belongs to God. And we&#39;re nothing. We&#39;re dust particles and less than dust particles in comparison to God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God be glorified over and above anything they idolize. And we went over these verses with the kids tonight, and we were talking about how there&#39;s, whatever is good here on earth, whatever is,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you might say something that is terrific or the best or something, God is always better, you know. God is always the Greatest. He&#39;s always a step above anything here we have on earth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, anything that you idolize here on earth, God is always better than that, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, like I just said, we&#39;re all only dust particles and everything here on earth, it&#39;s just nothing also. So, God has to be greater because He controls it all.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&#39;s the one God, the Creator, the Initiator, the Designer, and it doesn&#39;t miss words here, it doesn&#39;t say that He was the Constructor, you know, the Quran is very precise here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All God had to say was &quot;be&quot;, and He initiated the creation. His design, you know, He designed it, and all He had to say was &quot;be&quot;, and it was. And to God belongs the most beautiful names,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A lot of these names, a lot of Christians and Muslims both put to their idols, like,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I know for example, it&#39;s not here, but some people call Jesus the healer. Now, you would say</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;no, Jesus isn&#39;t the healer.&quot; And they&#39;ll &quot;ah&quot;, you know. They&#39;ll go into convulsion or something, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But you say &quot;God isn&#39;t the Healer&quot; and &quot;okay, well, we accept that&quot;, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are insulted by this, like Gatut was saying today in the Khutbah, you know,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;they aren&#39;t insulted when you lessen God, you know, but you lessen their idols, and that&#39;s not to be.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah. Then, it uses the same phrase here &quot;glorifying Him is everything in the heavens and the earth. He is the Almighty, the Wise.&quot; It&#39;s the same phrase here at the beginning of the Sura.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I know I always think &quot;well, the disbelievers, do they glorify God?&quot; You know, and I got to thinking about that this week, and, you know, they glorify God</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in making this come true, because their actions and everything show the believers that this is the truth, you know. You sit here and you read about the hypocrites and their allies, the disbelievers and so forth, and they say, you know, &quot;that&#39;s those people.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so, they show the glory of God by showing that His words are true here, you know, in the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Are there any more comments? The messenger: I meant to tell you to take two Suras, but I forgot.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Donna: Yeah, you did, but there&#39;s not much time to go. The messenger: I&#39;m gonna stop here. It&#39;s Ok. God bless you. You did a very good job.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Abdullah. Abudullah: Is this (unintelligible) and (unintelligible) Did you take all the Suras up to this point, all the Suras in the rest of the Quran?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you take this side, to the left side, you add them all the verse numbers and chapter numbers,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they are divisible, and if you take the rest of the Quran, you add the chapter numbers and verse numbers, they are divisible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It even mathematically designed</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: This is why the mountains will crumble.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Abdullah: If you take all the verse numbers, with the chapter numbers, you add them up, I can&#39;t remember the numbers now, it&#39;s divisible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, if you come to, all the way from the beginning of Quran to the verse 21,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">then if you take the next following 61 and all the rest of the Quran, you do the same thing, it&#39;s divisible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Add them all? Abdullah: Add them all with the chapter numbers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: I just want you to reflect with me on the Designer, something we take for granted.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">See, now I&#39;m scratching her ear, and when she did this, in the process, you just look at the design of the arm.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can take your arm like this to your ear, and then you go like this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How did God design this? It&#39;s a very important thing, you know. She did this without even thinking. But it&#39;s quite a design.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, more complicated are your teeth. How are your teeth fitting together? The upper and the lower, how are they fitting together?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perfectly. You did something wrong, Hamid.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are cutters in the front. You have these cutters in the front. And the eyeteeth, it&#39;s very important also, so you can pull on the stick if it is tough.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then back there are the molars that grind. They&#39;re flat, and they fit in each other perfectly. Every hole or cavity has something on the other side, unless you take too much sugar.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the two jaws are fitting together perfectly, except Hamid.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, we take our fingers, who designed the nails? What are these nails for?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Very simple things, and they keep growing and you keep cutting them, and they keep growing. God&#39;s design, the Designer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why two eyes, two kidneys? One mouth and two ears, which means shut up and listen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God is teaching us to listen a lot, not to talk too much, because we get in trouble.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One mouth and two ears, there&#39;s a message there. This is the design. Okay, well, we thank Donna for her good job. Next time will be three Suras.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And today, tomorrow starts the spring, today started the spring break at the university.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I know that my daughter will miss homework, so she&#39;s gonna be our teacher next week. She&#39;s gonna do homework.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suras 60, 61, and 62.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, she&#39;ll be our teacher next Friday. Three Suras, because we don&#39;t wanna take just one Sura every time, or it will take forever.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, Robert? Robert: This goes back to the verse on when we were talking about the hypocrites, and it says in the Quran that they are the ones who disbelieve and believe, disbelieve and believe, and then</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fall deeper into disbelief, and they are the ones who...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: No, these... Robert: They&#39;re with one side, they&#39;re with the other, and they go with one side and with the other. They&#39;re the people that never make up their minds. They want this and they want that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And in terms of us, when we make our covenant, like the hypocrite never knows they&#39;re a hypocrite.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The disbeliever never knows they&#39;re a disbeliever. Okay, so everybody, when it came right down to it, nobody thinks they&#39;re going to Hell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, when you look at this, like you said &quot;Ayatollah Khomeini thinks... or he&#39;s a hypocrite.&quot; But yet, because he thinks he&#39;s a believer, but then, again, the Christians... That&#39;s bad to say that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Certain Christians, or some Christians... The messenger: Actually, it&#39;s common to all human being. Robert: I don&#39;t wanna generalize, because you get in trouble if you do something like that. But saying certain people... Okay, if somebody idolizes Jesus, that&#39;s the best way to say it, then that person</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">may well think they are a believer, is an idolater. Okay, even that&#39;s where that makes them a disbeliever. Would that also make them a hypocrite? Well, no.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Yes, he&#39;s a hypocrite because he thinks he&#39;s a believer and he thinks he&#39;s going to Heaven.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Robert: But nobody thinks they&#39;re going to Hell. The messenger: Well, the disbeliever just doesn&#39;t even think... he thinks Hell doesn&#39;t exist, you see.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the hypocrite says he believes in God, and he knows there&#39;s Heaven and there&#39;s Hell. And he knows he&#39;s going to Heaven.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Robert: Well, then in that case, the only people who would be a disbeliever would be some atheists. The messenger: Yes, exactly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Robert: So then, all people are hypocrites? The messenger: Yes. The vast majority are. Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: That&#39;s why in Sura 12, God says &quot;Most people, no matter what you do, will not believe.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then, most of those who believe will fall in idol worship.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the vast majority are hypocrites.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: My question does not relate to what was discussed. The messenger: It&#39;s okay.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: In Sura 53, in the footnote, the cross says (unintelligible) of Muhammad. Quran (unintelligible). And it says that Muhammad was unconscious, when he was (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: No, that&#39;s wrong. This is what is written in the history books. But it is not true. I don&#39;t believe it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Explanation\History of written Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Muhammad was very much conscious, and he wrote the Quran with his own hand. These are things that we didn&#39;t know at the time of making this translation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Then, (unintelligible) from the new Quran. Those verses that (unintelligible). What was the reason for gathering Ayahs, and having every Ayah to be verified?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: No, no, no, that didn&#39;t happen either. This is what they said. This is what they wrote in their books.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">According to them, they collected the Quran, and they had every verse witnessed by at least two witnesses,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">except the last two verses in Sura 9. They found it only with a late Muslim, Medinan Muslim.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then the Hadith supported him by saying that his testimony equals two. And this is all nonsense, of course. This is the idea.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the Quran was written by the Prophet, with his own hand, and the instructions were on the side as to where every piece goes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the committee that was putting the Quran together during Uthman&#39;s time were using that. They didn&#39;t need any witnesses.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I&#39;m narrating what they wrote in Bukhari and the Sunnah books and all that, because it&#39;s a bunch of nonsense.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Then was that being used as an evidence that the two verses were doubtful?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Right, because, you know, the thief feels something and exposes himself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: But if that was nonsense, then how could that be used as an evidence?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Because it indicates that they were suspicious of their own crime. They knew their crime. You know, there is a famous story in the Middle East.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know if it is also known in Iran or not, but this king or something, one of his precious birds was stolen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, he got all his servants and he lined them up in a line. And he said &quot;I want the person who stole my precious bird to come forward and confess, and I will forgive that person. I&#39;ll forgive him.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nobody came forward. So, he kept saying &quot;I know who the person is, but if he comes forward, I&#39;ll forgive him. I want him to confess on his own and bring my precious bird back.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nobody came forward. Then he said &quot;you see, I know because that person has a feather on his head.&quot; So, one of them went like this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So the guilty person always exposes himself in this manner.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they made up these stories reflecting their suspicions of the two verses. So, I reported them as it is written in Bukhari.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Maybe, I should point out that the fact is... A man: Yeah, it doesn&#39;t say that. The messenger: Okay. Good point.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Any other questions? Okay, we&#39;re gonna wish Matt a happy birthday. His birthday was Wednesday. We&#39;re gonna pray to God to give him the happiest year of his life coming up, and every year after that to be even better.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And as you recite, turn to God and ask Him to fulfill your dearest wishes.

And the last Sura revealed, Sura number 110, was revealed in his Hajj pilgrimage</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">0:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">only a few months before he died. The last Sura revealed in Medina was Sura number 9.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">0:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the Prophet had the Quran written with his own hand in the chronological sequence,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">0:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with instructions on the side saying where every piece goes. That&#39;s all the Prophet had.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was not the Quran that God intended for the world. 19 years later, during the era of Uthman, Islam had gone to Syria, and Iraq, and Egypt,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and Uthman wanted to make copies to send to those new Muslims in new countries.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, he appointed a committee to carry out the Prophet&#39;s, God&#39;s instructions, to take that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">original copy. By that time, it was with the Prophet&#39;s wife, Hafsa, Omar&#39;s daughter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Uthman sent for it, and he gave it to the committee to carry out the instructions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This piece goes here, this piece goes here. And put the Quran in the order that God intends for the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I think you know the rest of the story where, when they finished, and they came to</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the last Sura revealed in Medina, Sura 9, someone suggested to add a couple of verses</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to honor the Prophet. So, they committed that big crime that caused the war between Ali and Uthman, and then the</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">war against Ali and his family, the Prophet&#39;s family, that ended with the eradication of</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the Prophet&#39;s family in Karbala. And the winners were the Umayyads who put the two verses in the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the version that came to us about the war and the history of the Quran is the version of those so-called winners.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They thought they won the war. So, the announcement I want to make is that this is the last time we use this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As of next week, we&#39;ll use the new translation. This is the announcement.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it will not be in the book form yet, but you will be handed the new translation to study.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is the last time we use this. It&#39;s a historical day. But the new translation is gonna come out. It&#39;s gonna be hardcover. It&#39;s gonna be luxurious.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You see the page there? This is a very hazy cover. It&#39;s not a good one.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it&#39;s gonna be sharp and it will be in gold stamp. The cover itself, the hardcover outside will be dark blue.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it will be, for the first time in history, the pure Quran, in Arabic and in English.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, as you know, some of you read the small booklet about the two verses. And...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mentioned many of the reasons why God did not let those people have the pure Quran,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">because they simply did not deserve it. Because only 19 years after the Prophet&#39;s death, they corrupted the religion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They started to worship Muhammad against his will, in the same way the Christians do with Jesus.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&#39;re all humans. The Christians are humans and the Muslims are humans, and both of them fell for the trap</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of Satan, and they started to idolize the Prophet against his will.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They invented an Azan that has... does not have the name of God alone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Prayer became distorted and did not have the name of God alone. And just to make a long story short, they did not deserve the pure Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, there are people who devote their worship to God alone, and they uphold the Quran alone,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and these are the true Muslims. The true Muslims will have the true Quran. And this is really a historical event.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As you know, the famous statement in the Quran is that the month of Ramadan is when the Quran was revealed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is exactly when the Quran is going to be completed and will be purified.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it&#39;s gonna come out, gonna be sent to the press in Ramadan, IN SHAA ALLAH. And I know you believe me when I tell you that I didn&#39;t plan it this way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was not planned this way. As a matter of fact, I was slowed down so many times, I was frustrated due to my ignorance.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I shouldn&#39;t be frustrated. You should know that God is arranging the time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And all these delays were designed so that the pure Quran would come out in Ramadan.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I&#39;m glad to share this with you.

After that, this is an illusion, as I&#39;ve spoken of before, including the illusion that I did something, that I thought something, that I had this idea.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Rashad said &quot;God arranges everything, including the thoughts in our minds.&quot; Those of us who are going to invent some new and exciting tool to make a job easier,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">when we do that and we discuss it with those fellow people, fellow colleagues, and say &quot;look what you thought of, look what I thought of, look what it will do.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Never have thought that God did that.

It just turns out that the majority of Jews, the majority of Christians, the majority of Muslims have been tricked by Satan.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this verse here, 6, is talking about the distortion of God&#39;s choosing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the key word would be to the exclusion of all others.

It doesn&#39;t matter what they do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is why God says &quot;why don&#39;t you long for death?&quot; And like Catherine said &quot;we don&#39;t long for death because we know that the longer we worship God, the greater, the bigger, the more developed is our soul.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And also, we&#39;re not that arrogant. You have to be really arrogant to long for death.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But if you feel that you need to develop and grow your soul, that you need to atone for past sins, and you want to make up for the past, and things like that, you will not long for death.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: I don&#39;t think that the Jews, they are going to long...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Yeah, they do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Yeah, actually a lot of them do think that automatically, you know, Muhammad will take the (unintelligible) out of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Which is a wrong concept. It&#39;s the exact opposite.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When you talk about sibling rivalry, I guess these people didn&#39;t know about Apamea and Naghmeh.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These two go to the bathroom together.

You&#39;re like this at home, right?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: Yes. The messenger: See.

A man: It&#39;s wicked, at the end of the verse 7, therefore indicates to... On the surface, it indicates to the Jews. It refers to the verse 6.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But as you mentioned, there are some laws (unintelligible). Therefore it&#39;s the wicked who also in general terms (unintelligible). The messenger: Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: See, here, we don&#39;t say we&#39;re the only ones. We raise that verse in Sura 2, verse number 62, it says that anyone who worships God alone is our brother or sister.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Regardless of what they call themselves. Because our objective is worshiping God alone. Anyone who does that, we love them and respect them for it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Explains How Jews/Christians can be submitters. They must follow their religious commandments.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is actually a very important criteria. If you go any place...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Back to Catherine. And number 9. A man: If a person is a Christian and worships God alone, he does a certain thing that he&#39;s not supposed to do. He doesn&#39;t pray 5 times a day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: No. Did he read the Quran? A man: Excuse me? The messenger: Did he read the Quran? A man: Him? The messenger: Yeah. A man: Yeah. The messenger: Well, it&#39;s alright. He goes to Heaven. It&#39;s 2:62.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: He worships God alone. You see, that person, if he comes across the Quran, he will agree with it, wholeheartedly. He will find nothing objectionable.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Absolutely. I mean, the verse 62 names Christians by name. Jews, Christians.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, it says &quot;anyone who worships God alone and believes in the Hereafter, the Day of Judgement, and is righteous will make it to Heaven.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Martha. Martha: In a verse Quran says that God chose to make us in one congregation and there are different rules for different different congregations. Everyone follows their own rules.

I&#39;ll explain it to you. You can be a Jew if you want to and go to Heaven.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But if you decide to be a Jew, you have to follow the Jewish law. You have to honor the Sabbath. On Saturday, you don&#39;t work. You don&#39;t answer the telephone. You spend the day worshiping God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You follow their diet system according to the Torah. You follow their laws. You pray three times a day. You do the Jewish law. You worship God alone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But now that you&#39;ve seen the Quran and the completion of the message, it will not be very smart to go back in time because God...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The scripture, the message from God, evolved with the human being.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the Quran tells you that anyone who&#39;s following even one of these systems, the divinely revealed systems, it&#39;s all right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: But didn&#39;t you mention in verse 62:7, you have to believe in the concept of Towhid and to get out? The messenger: Yes. Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: As I understand the laws of Judaism, even though those who kept kosher and dairy and non-dairy and all those, Sabath and all nine yards, they don&#39;t believe in the...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: No, they&#39;re not Jewish then. They&#39;re just believers. A man: We are actually telling, in another word, we are telling them what the laws are. The messenger: No, the Torah, God tells them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: God tells you. If they do not believe in the Hereafter, they are not following the Torah, they&#39;re not Jewish. Just like the Muslims who follow Hadith and Sunnah, they don&#39;t believe in the Hereafter according to the Quranic criteria.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&#39;re not Muslims.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">See, when I say Jewish, I mean Jewish. When I say Christian, I mean Christian. When I say Muslim, I mean Muslim. So, A Christian who does not believe in the Hereafter, Heaven and Hell, is not a Christian.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because he&#39;s not following what Jesus said. And the Jew who does not believe in the Hereafter is not following the Torah, or what Moses said.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: So, you can&#39;t say what you can&#39;t guess. Christianity as defined today, you can&#39;t define Christianity as someone who follows what Jesus taught, rather than Christianity as it exists. The messenger: Well, by definition...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Christianity, like you said, (unintelligible). Well, you can&#39;t do that because you go to church and it all operates and functions around, you know, the worship of the Trinity or God, Jesus, and the Father. The messenger: That&#39;s not Christianity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: But as it exists today. The messenger: That&#39;s actually Paulism. A man: That&#39;s an example. The messenger: No, see, by definition, a Christian is one who follows Christ. The so-called Christianity today is really Paulism. It&#39;s not Christianity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Yeah, I&#39;ve read that. A man: I mean, is there a Jewish Christianity in existence today? The messenger: Sure. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: The Christians who do not..... The messenger: ....the messenger of God, they&#39;re Christians. Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Actually I... A man: In Judaism also? The messenger: Yes. They&#39;re Jews.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">No conflict with worshipping God alone under different religions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: All kinds. Jews of all kind, with Orthodox Jews, Reform Jews, Conservative Jews, who are true Muslims.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: That&#39;s kind of funny, because it&#39;s all types. So you can consider everybody a true Christian, because Jesus preached to all about God. So, you can say we&#39;re Christian. The messenger: Sure. A man: So, you know....</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: One religion. The messenger: That religion is worshipping God alone. Yes, one religion is practiced by Jews, Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists. But it is one religion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: So, it is evolving. The messenger: Well, the message evolved with the human race.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: No, there&#39;s no conflict at all. If you read the Bible, the Torah, read Deuteronomy, it&#39;s beautiful. Just like the Quran. Read the Psalms. Like the Quran. Isaiah. Proverbs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Read the Bible, you&#39;ll find it identical. Really, the original scripture started with the Torah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then we have, after this, the Psalms, and Isaiah, and (unintelligible), Proverbs, which is Solomon&#39;s book.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&#39;re all identical to the Quran. There&#39;s no conflict at all.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where is the conflict? Give me an example of conflict. Hamid: If it is more information in the Quran than what is told in the Christian Bible, it&#39;s going to be...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">if we are saying we are stretching the knowledge to unlimited depth knowledge of the Quran, the is one criteria.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the other fellow, which is the Christian, he limits it all the way to the Hebrew Bible, and ignores the rest. But you see the conflict.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: But that&#39;s... Where is the conflict? Do they all worship God alone?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: Well, at the beginning, I said, if this is more... it supersedes the other books. There has to be...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: I see it now. I&#39;m sorry, I just explained it the way I could. I think there is a conflict there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Oh, Ok. There is no conflict at all. All of them advocate the worship of God alone, and all of them give you a system to develop your soul.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: The basics are the same. Three religions, they all worship God and God alone. The messenger: Right. That&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: But that is not enough, I think. The messenger: That&#39;s it. That&#39;s enough. It&#39;s the whole thing. Hamid: If that was enough, what was the reason of three big religions? The messenger: Because of God&#39;s mercy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: It&#39;s verse two. [62:2] He is the One who sent to the gentiles a messenger from among them, to recite to them His revelations, purify them, and teach them the scripture and wisdom.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gentiles are the people who did not have a scripture. God did not want to leave them alone. He didn&#39;t leave them lost. He wanted to guide them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: Also, God knew that the other scriptures were touched by human beings and changed, and were altered.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then we got the Quran, which is never, you know, it&#39;s being, it never touches, and it&#39;s preserved.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it just gave the Arabs a different set of guidelines than it gave Jews and Christians. And that&#39;s all that it is.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the one that, why it came after everything else is that God knew that this one was never gonna be touched.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">God allowed previous scriptures to be altered as the Quran will dominate and remain unaltered. Islam will dominate within 50yrs from 1989.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Okay. Actually, this is the chicken and the egg. God permitted the distortion of the other scriptures because this is the one that is gonna be in the whole world about 50 years from now. The others will be history.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But this is the only scripture, this is untouched, this is God&#39;s complete message to be given to the vast majority of the human race.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, even 50 years from now, we&#39;ll still have 65 billion people coming to use this as their message.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is God&#39;s message to come to supersede and take the place of all the others. A woman: If God didn&#39;t permit the scriptures to be such the way they were, it still preserves the correct message.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it&#39;s a test for those people to get the right information out of it because some do, and some really don&#39;t see the conflict. So it&#39;s a test then. The messenger: Yeah, exactly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But all those scriptures are supposed to vanish. This is why we have these overwhelming physical proofs that will simply take over the world, the whole world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just give the world 50 years from now, maybe less.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: This is God&#39;s law. He said We&#39;re gonna come... it would be... look at page 396, right there in front of you, verse 9.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[9:33] He is the One who sent His messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, and will make it dominate all religions, in spite of the idol worshipers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is God&#39;s law. This is not wishful thinking. Hamid: And it indicates this date also and saying the time, 50 years, what I&#39;m saying is, this doesn&#39;t mention anything about 50 years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: And I think it will remain with us as mankind until the end of the life, Judaism and Christianity. It has been with us and it will.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Well, Islam will be the dominant, like America will be a Muslim country if you wanna look at it this way. It will no longer be a Christian, a Judeo-Christian country.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It will be a Muslim country. And this is God&#39;s law. The messenger: I mean, today, can you call America a Muslim country? A man: No.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Okay, 50 years from now, America will be a Muslim country. And it&#39;s not wishful thinking.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: You are actually saying something that is based on your desire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: No, it is not. Apparently, you don&#39;t know what the miracle is, so I suggest that you read the miracle of Quran and look at it carefully. Then, you will agree with me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: You say 50 years? The messenger: Maximum, maximum 50 years. Probably be less than that. It&#39;ll be more like 20 years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Things are gonna happen very fast in the next 20 years. But I&#39;m giving myself a long time just to be careful.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Mahmoud?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Yes, yes. It&#39;s 19 x 19 x 32 The messenger: Hamid?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: I was just saying, in 20 years or 50 years, or whatever it is, it&#39;s an estimate that hopefully, IN SHAA ALLAH, by this time, we will realize the real message and the truth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Yes, things are gonna happen very fast, folks. Hamid: So, it is estimated then? The messenger: Like I said, 50 years is maximum. But it&#39;s most probably 20 years. In your lifetime.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: IN SHAA ALLAH.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Hamid, do you know that the sun will rise tomorrow? Hamid: Yeah. The messenger: How? How do you know that?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: Because we have seen up to now that it did every day. The messenger: Right. Because there are certain signs that indicate. See, look at the clock, it is 8:15.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In 12 hours from now, it will be 8:15 in the morning. So, you know that the sun will come. This is a sign that the sunrise is approaching.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the same with, if you read the miracle of the Quran and understand it, you&#39;ll know that this country will be Muslim within 20 to 50 years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I show you, it is God&#39;s law, I have it in front of you. 61 verse 9. This is the verse that is repeated 3 times in the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Back to Catherine. We&#39;ve taken the whole thing from her. Verse 9.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Catherine: [62:9] O you who believe, when the Congregational Prayer (Salat Al-Jumu&#39;ah) is announced on Friday, you shall hasten to the commemoration of GOD, and drop all business. This is better for you, if you only knew.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[62:10] Once the prayer is completed, you may spread through the land to seek GOD&#39;s bounties, and continue to remember GOD frequently, that you may succeed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[62:11] When some of them come across a business deal, or some entertainment, they rush to it and leave you standing! Say, &quot;What GOD possesses is far better than the entertainment or the business. GOD is the best Provider.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think most of you know that I am employed in a crisis center. And, M&atilde; Sh&atilde; All&atilde;h, I haven&#39;t missed a Friday Jumu&#39;ah since going to work there. Actually, that coincided with a commitment on my part not to miss.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you can&#39;t organize crises. As you all know, they just kind of fall out of the sky. And every Friday, thank God, I&#39;ve been able to walk out of there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And no one calls me back, and the building is still standing when I get back there, and no one says anything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s very important that we understand how important it is that we come and join together on Friday. There is nothing that should keep us from that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What I wrote in the margin, and I don&#39;t know when it was I wrote it, but I wrote in the margin of those three verses, illusion and unreal, and we need to leave it as easily as we turn off the television, because this is what&#39;s real.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Coming together at Jumu&#39;ah and to study Quran and be with believers is real.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The rest of the world we live in is the illusion that God created to sustain us and guide us and teach us and extend His mercy to us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it&#39;s set up entirely for us. It&#39;s like some giant playground. Some people get injured on the playground, and some people have a wonderful time. But it is an illusion, and this is the real thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&#39;s nothing that should keep us from this. Absolutely nothing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Does anyone have any comments on the last three verses?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: How would you have a group of people meet in your house?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: What does it say? A woman: [62:9] ...when the Congregational Prayer (Salat Al-Jumu&#39;ah) is announced on Friday, you shall hasten to the commemoration of GOD...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Ok. What is Friday in Arabic? The messenger: And Jumu&#39;ah means what?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Right. A group of people</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: Even 2 people have a... The messenger: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: It came from Abraham. Since the time of Abraham.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Yeah. Yeah. That&#39;s what it means. What do you mean it came first? Are you talking about two things? What are the two things?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Is there a first and second in your mind? I just wanna understand your question.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: You said &quot;which came first?&quot; What do you have in mind when you say &quot;which came first?&quot; Which and which? What and what?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: The word for Friday, which means coming together. (unintelligible). The messenger: No. No.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: It hasn&#39;t always been that. There was a time when there was no names of the weekdays. Like the Sabbath. You mean Sabbath?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Yeah. Sure. They had the Friday Prayers before Muhammad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Well, you don&#39;t know that all the practices of Islam came through Abraham.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All the practices came from Abraham. Look at 16:123 will tell you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: But wasn&#39;t the Prayer different from the Prayer at the time of Abraham? The messenger: No. Hamid: Five times Prayer? The messenger: Exactly the same. Yeah. Hamid: It&#39;s exactly the same? The messenger: Yep.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: And you think the prayer caused... I think your question was this way. If you wanna learn science, you go to university to learn it or you wanna learn it and then university is just a tool.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think the Prayer is important and for that purpose you go to mosque. Or you have to go to mosque in order to Pray.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Okay? Hamid: That was the question. Which comes first? Hamid: You can pray... The messenger: No. That&#39;s not the question. That is wrong.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: This is wrong. No, that&#39;s wrong. There&#39;s no &quot;when you&#39;re called.&quot; That&#39;s not in Arabic.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: When the Salat is announced. There&#39;s no &quot;you are called&quot; in Arabic.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s a passive... I don&#39;t know what the English grammar is. It&#39;s a passive statement. It doesn&#39;t say that. It doesn&#39;t say &quot;when you are called.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Back to Catherine and the next Sura. Oh, let me emphasize.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Absolutely. This is what I was gonna say now. It is unfortunate that my generation, for example, in Iran, they grew up with the lack of the Friday prayer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Better to abandon a business deal of $10Million and attend Friday Prayer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it is not as firmly implanted in them to do the Friday Prayer until the Khomeini Revolution came and they started to do the Friday Prayer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I found it disastrous from my observations. There are many fortunate people like the Sabahis and the Moinis.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They came to the Friday Prayer readily. God is guiding them. And they did it easily. But it was not easy for many people to do the Friday Prayer. And I found it disastrous for them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just the Friday Prayer. Because they didn&#39;t do it. They caused their dropout.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, I know that. I&#39;m just trying to emphasize the extreme importance of the Friday Prayer. God is saying here &quot;and drop all business.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is very important. And it says &quot;this is better for you.&quot; If you are waiting for somebody to sign a deal with you that will give you 10 million dollars. And that is at the time of the Prayer, God is telling you &quot;go to the Friday Prayer and leave those 10 million dollars, and it will be better for you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because God will give you 20 million. It is very important, and it is difficult for... If we grew up like the last generations of Iran, if we grew up without the obligatory Friday prayer, it becomes more difficult to adapt to the Friday Prayer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And at the same time, the reward is also doubled. Actually, multiplied many-fold for doing that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: I have been to other Middle East countries, but I imagine it is more or less the same.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have, in this verse, I have the personal experience in Turkey.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And generally, women do not go to the Friday Prayer. And I asked someone in Iran, over there, and I said &quot;why don&#39;t women go to the Friday Prayer?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he told me that it is because of a certain Hadith that decree that women shouldn&#39;t go.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And when I mentioned this verse, he couldn&#39;t say anything to me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: It doesn&#39;t say &quot;O, you believing men.&quot; A man: It says &quot;O, you who believe.&quot; So, I mean, the verse is for both men and women. The messenger: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: So, I guess, but they have a base in Hadith that the women aren&#39;t going to come to the Friday prayer. So, I think that &quot;O, you who believe&quot; is maybe &quot;O, you men.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: There is a Hadith that says that women should not go to the Friday Prayer. And the next Hadith says that women are deficient in religion because they don&#39;t go to the Friday Prayer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, what a catch-22.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: In the article that was in the newspaper, they said that it&#39;s obligatory for the men to go, but it&#39;s optional for the women to go.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: In the paper, you mean the Islamic Center? No, they said &quot;we discourage that.&quot; They said &quot;we don&#39;t want women to go.&quot; Because they follow Hadith.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, obviously, here, verse 9 says &quot;O, you who believe.&quot; It doesn&#39;t say men or women. This is an obligatory duty for men and women.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s very, very important. Hamid: Why is it important? Why does it emphasize the importance of that?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Because it&#39;s a commandment. This is a commandment from God. It says, [62:9] O you who believe, when the Congregational Prayer (Salat Al-Jumu&#39;ah) is announced on Friday, you shall hasten to the commemoration of GOD, and drop all business.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is a commandment from God. Hamid: Well, I can say a few reasons for why it is that particular day, the Friday. I think it is the end of the week. And, therefore, you can&#39;t...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: There&#39;s no excuse. Hamid: What? The messenger: Sorry. Hamid: So, you can actually go through the problems of the whole week and have a calm and answer the problems and then try to solve it within the community.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: That&#39;s not the purpose. The purpose is not solving problems. The purpose is to commemorate God in a group of people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: That&#39;s the purpose. Hamid: I have a comment here. The messenger: Yeah. Hamid: I think, as a Muslim, it&#39;s very important to ask God&#39;s (unintelligible). Any particular action (unintelligible). He wants the excuse of &quot;O, you who believe.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: That&#39;s fine. Hamid: Why they are even where they were placed at home. Also, why they are doing when. The messenger: Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: And, going back to what you were saying earlier, emphasizing, why Friday, I guess, I would say, in most of the Islamic countries, Friday is the end of the week.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: You can make Wednesday the end of the week if you want to. Hamid: There is a good power here. As you know, we have a good power in the Muslim world. And, so, it goes from that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The problems of the Muslim society and the dangers that modern society are going to face from the other non-believers and non-Muslim societies are to be discussed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because the majority of the people get together. And, since we all live in a society that is not facing great respect to all the people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The mass of the people, the number of the people. And, these mass of the people are the ones that can prove their value. And, they have their own conclusions. And, they have their own problems.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s not the way the society is now. Particularly, I would say, it&#39;s not yet the way to discuss the problems, discuss their actions...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Yeah, this happens automatically. If you carry out a commandment, this will happen automatically. That&#39;s exactly the purpose of the Friday Prayer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We all get together and we know each other. Hamid: It&#39;s not only to get together and pray to God. You can pray to God at our home. You know, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. But, there, in a place, there&#39;s 100,000 people...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: So, you agree with the Friday Prayer that this is important, right? Hamid: Yes, of course. The messenger: You do agree.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: ...acceptance. You know, why Friday, and you can only go on Friday and pray and don&#39;t talk about problems will take the concept away. What if, maybe it&#39;s nonsense, you shouldn&#39;t go. If the Imam is just talking nonsense, you&#39;d better stay home.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Then how will you change the situation if you stay at home? Hamid: You&#39;re not going there. You have to talk about the situation. You have to discuss the problem. You just, you just, I was just...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: What if the Imam is giving fantastic lessons that will save your life? Why do you assume the negative?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: The Imam cannot give us a fantastic lesson. We discussed it. You have show Showrunner. You have lots of people from different societies, from different beliefs, you know, discussing a problem.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You see what&#39;s happening. What has happened to you from Shanbe to Jumu&#39;ah, from Saturday to Jumu&#39;ah (Friday). What are the problems? It could be cultural problems, economic problems, social problems, cultural problems</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Yeah. That&#39;s fine. Hamid: And all these problems must be discussed... you are free. So, that&#39;s why you&#39;re have a Jumu&#39;ah Prayer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: I agree with you. Martha: The Jumu&#39;ah Prayer could be a Monday (unintelligible) Wednesday (unintelligible). Hamid: Oh, no.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Martha: I think, I think, ...... in Arabic....I don&#39;t know why you said that. It just makes no real sense. The name itself preserves that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter what day of the week it calls on, in other languages, in Arabic, you just have to get around it. That&#39;s all you need. It&#39;s the name of the day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can give it a name from the fact that it&#39;s Friday. The messenger: I don&#39;t think anyone is objecting to do the Friday prayer on Friday.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Martha: No. I mean, the idea is that, this Friday is because that, that allows you to discuss and be free on Friday.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Well, people are free to say what they want. Hamid: Well, Friday, you&#39;re emotionally ready. You don&#39;t have any classes. You don&#39;t have any work to do. We all have business, family on Saturday, yeah. (Unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Martha: In a Muslim country, if the day of gathering together were on a Wednesday, everything should be adjusted. All the companies should be closed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Oh, Martha, Martha, please, let&#39;s not discuss nonsense here. I mean, not you. Please Just, we can go on discussing the vain talk. Let&#39;s go back to Catherine and Sura 62. 63.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We can make an assumption and go on discussing it, you know.

Does God mean that when you ask something like that, it doesn&#39;t matter what he asks?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: No. What this means is that God will accept the prayer for forgiveness for the believers, but not for the hypocrites.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: That&#39;s what it&#39;s telling us. They are too arrogant anyway, and they don&#39;t have the belief in their hearts. So they think it&#39;s all nonsense anyway.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Pardon? Dr. Sabahi: So, it doesn&#39;t have anything to do with SHAFA&#39;AT (Intercession)? The messenger: No, it actually proves there is no SHAFA&#39;AT (Intercession).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because it&#39;s only the believers who will be helped, and the believers are going to Heaven anyway.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The disbelievers and the hypocrites cannot be helped, so what&#39;s the use of SHAFA&#39;AT? So, this was the Quranic position.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Quranic position is that every one of us, IN SHAA ALLAH, when we go to Heaven, will say &quot;please God, I want my mother with me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I love her very much.&quot; Ok? And this is SHAFA&#39;AT. You will say it. I will say it. Everyone will say it. IN SHAA ALLAH in Heaven.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, this SHAFA&#39;AT is useful if the mother is a good person that is already going to Heaven.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the mother was not to go to Heaven, this SHAFA&#39;AT will not do any good. Therefore, it is really useless.But we will say it anyway, out of emotion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is the understanding of SHAFA&#39;AT. And this is exactly what this verse was saying.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is saying when the messenger asks for forgiveness, it will be accepted for the believers, but not for the hypocrites or the disbelievers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Exactly. Because it&#39;s true.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Catherine: It&#39;s our human nature to do it. The messenger: Not because it&#39;s something that is... Because it&#39;s a fact.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Yes. The messenger: Anybody can repent. I think this is a point that Catherine raised.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But if a person goes back from belief to disbelief, they can always repent and come back to it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are other verses in the Quran. In Sura 4, verse 137, it says, you can believe, disbelieve, believe, disbelieve, and so on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the Quran is talking about the period when they are disbelievers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: No, there is no such thing as God cannot. Repeat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rephrase your question.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, no, no. There is no such thing as God cannot. Now, rephrase your question.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There you go. Yeah. Now, you can have it. Go ahead.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah. This is the end of the verse. Look at it. Verse 6. &quot;God does not guide the wicked people.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are already wicked, so He does not guide them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, they can, because this is our free decision.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God will (unintelligible) to their repentance. The minute they change their decision to believers, they are believers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not as long as they&#39;re hypocrites or disbelievers. Only when they make a decision to believe.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right. As soon as they make a decision to believe, they step into God&#39;s Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right. As long as they are hypocrites and disbelievers, they are outside of God&#39;s circle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Douglas? Douglas: In these verses, God is revealing to us (unintelligible). He&#39;s revealing to us so otherwise we will know. We could see they are liars. They cannot understand. They do not know. God is revealing to us but otherwise we may not be able to see.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Cause we don&#39;t see Douglas: Cause we don&#39;t see. The messenger: God says &quot;I know them, you don&#39;t know them.&quot; Douglas: Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Douglas: The other point I wanted to make is basically, when we use this example of wooden logs, does this mean, for example, like food, clothing and water, it&#39;s all service? The messenger: No.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Douglas: I&#39;m just asking. How logs (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: No. Can you communicate with a wooden log?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: In fact, there&#39;s an Arabic, there&#39;s an Egyptian, excuse me, there&#39;s an Egyptian proverb and an English proverb.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It says &quot;they&#39;re standing there like a log.&quot; Is this in English? Turkish. Yes. And in Arabic, too. And English. And Egyptian.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Did we finish Sura 63? Go ahead and finish it. Catherine: Verse 9. [63:9] O you who believe, do not be distracted by your money and your children from remembering GOD. Those who do this are the losers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[63:10] You shall give from our provisions to you before death comes to you, then you say, &quot;My Lord, if only You could delay this for a short while! I would then be charitable and join the righteous!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[63:11] GOD never delays the appointed time of death for any soul. GOD is fully Cognizant of everything you do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The easiest thing in the world to do is to be distracted by those that we care about the most. And God warns us against that. In other verses, He says that these may be enemies of ours, and we do need to be cautious of that and avoid idolatry.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Spending in charity is so easy if we know that nothing we have came from us or will go with us anywhere.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It comes from God. It&#39;s not ours to start with. And if we give it in charity, we give it only where it was meant to go.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Verse 11 says [63:11] GOD never delays the appointed time of death for any soul....</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there&#39;s nothing more that you can do after the Day of Resurrection. But there is so much mercy from God, and we have so many chances before that day. So many. They&#39;re limitless.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As long as we live, we have a chance, an opportunity God constantly provides those opportunities for the hypocrites to repent, for us to continue to work right up until the last moment.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That verse 11 sounds very final, but when we know the mercy of God and what He provides for us on a minute-to-minute, second-to-second basis in this world, it&#39;s extraordinary.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it doesn&#39;t need to frighten us. We just need to know that there is a limit. And once we&#39;ve reached it, it&#39;s over. We have no more to do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Any other comments and questions? A man: May I ask a question?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Yeah. Go ahead. The messenger: Let&#39;s just thank Catherine for an excellent Quranic study.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Catherine: I can go to 114 in 10 minutes if you say you want me to go.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Now, we&#39;ll get to general questions. The messenger: Farhad?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Farhad: ...Many, many, many decisions have to be made and why? Sometimes a group of people think as (unintelligible), toward a Sura and Aya (verse) (unintelligible). What is the criterion to to order of what this was more important than this?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible). Is there any criteria like that? Or that&#39;s my suggestion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Everything God said, excuse me... Farhad: The number of times that a subject involves being mentioned, is that important?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Being a good person without observing the commandments is in vain.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: That&#39;s a good sign, yeah. But all of them are important. All the laws are important.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wanna go back to the Friday business. Remember that the title of the Sura is named after the Prayer, &quot;Friday.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a Sura in the Quran entitled &quot;Friday.&quot; And the commandment is there saying &quot;O you who believe when the Salat Prayer&#39;s announced on Friday, go and drop all business.&quot; That&#39;s the commandment.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All the commandments of God are important.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Farhad: Why is &quot;La Elaha Ella Allah&quot; more important than anything else? The messenger: Cause this is the basic requirement, you know. I mean, if it&#39;s not there, nothing else exists.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everything else will be in vain. I mean, a person can be truthful and honest and is a very nice person but he does not believe in God, and all his work is in vain.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, &quot;La Elaha Ella Allah&quot; goes without saying. Then after that, all the commandments are very important. Every single one of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Farhad: For example, can you say Salat is more important than Zakat? The messenger: No.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Farhad: Because it&#39;s mentioned more than Zakat. The messenger: Actually, they are both usually mentioned together, Salat and Zakat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Farhad: Or Fasting. The messenger: Fasting is very important. The messenger: You&#39;re disobeying God if you don&#39;t fast. You&#39;re disobeying God if you don&#39;t do the Zakat. You&#39;re disobeying God if you don&#39;t do the Prayer. You&#39;re disobeying God if you lie or cheat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, take your pick. It&#39;s very expensive if you... A woman: But also, I think it&#39;s important to say that God knows what&#39;s true and what we have to do and God always gives, you know, people who can&#39;t do it, gives us alternatives.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Well, it&#39;s our choice, you know. You can put your finger in the fire or not. It&#39;s up to you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, God left it up to us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You heard Jehan today. If he doesn&#39;t wanna do the push-ups, he will think that God is doing everything, not him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it&#39;s as simple as that. We&#39;re celebrating Laila&#39;s birthday today.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t mean to embarrass you. But her birthday was the 19th of March, is that so?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And she didn&#39;t even know that her address was a multiple of 19.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is why she came to Tucson. Celebrating her birthday with us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are so many things that we need to do. We read Al-F&atilde;tehah for Soad, remember? Because of her tests.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Congregation asked to recite Fateha for someone&rsquo;s exam.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, she passed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But there&#39;s another big test coming up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And she&#39;s greedy again. And she wants us to read Al-F&atilde;tehah for her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God never turns us down. And Ahmad needs that we ask Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta&#39;ala to help him with his PhD exam. It&#39;s Monday?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, of course. Yes, you better. You better ask.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God is generous. God is generous. And we have a perfect record so far, Alhamdu Lillah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God never never turns us down. Strange things we asked for. And He never turned us down.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We even overturned governments. We did that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What else? You&#39;re supposed to remind me. Who else asked for Al-F&atilde;tehah?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, we recited Al-F&atilde;tehah for Linda Baroni because she had some infection in the hospital.

Anyone who believes in GOD and leads a righteous life, He will admit him into gardens with flowing streams; they abide therein forever. GOD will generously reward him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Again, we&#39;re told here that the messenger recites God&#39;s revelation.

I&#39;m gonna have an appendix on it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When you read the appendix, you&#39;ll see that evolution is perfectly all right. But it is a divinely guided process.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fly has 4,000 lenses in each eye. 4,000. It did not evolve into 10,000. It didn&#39;t evolve into x-ray vision.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For millions of years, for millions of years, it is 4,000 lenses in each eye.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But there are varieties of flies. Within the same species, there is evolution, within the same species.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We got the navel orange out of the regular oranges. All of a sudden, we have this wonderful orange without any seeds, tastes good.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it came from another orange tree, not from an apple tree. So, it&#39;s from the same species. There is evolution within the species.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But every species was created independently. But the point that I want to emphasize here that you need to remember is that God created seven earths identical to this earth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the statistical laws bear this out. But there is no life on them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because on the Day of Judgment, which is the most important day, that&#39;s the Eternal Day, when all the people past, present, and future will be there,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we will all be there and we will all witness that there were six other earths like this one, but no life on any of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because what the evolutionists, the atheist evolutionists say, because we are believing evolutionists. They are atheist evolutionists.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The atheist evolutionists say that life evolved out of nothing here on this earth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because of the circumstances, because of the amino acids, the lightning, the ethylene, and all the other nitrogen and stuff.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Is that the Big Bang Theory? The messenger: No, it&#39;s not the Big Bang Theory. The Big Bang Theory is confirmed in the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The evolution, Darwin&#39;s theory, that life evolved on this earth, and</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and this is how our eyes came into being, that this eye was a depression in a photosensitive cell, a depression in the skin that kept evolving until it gave the eye.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I wonder why we have the eyes here and not in our hands, for example.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is the purpose of creating six other earths, identical to this one.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pardon? Laila: Because the eyes are walking... The messenger: You have eyes in your feet, Laila?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laila: I think so. I didn&#39;t even breathe. The messenger: Well, that&#39;s a step in evolution, but still within the species.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;re still a human being.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Any questions on Sura 65?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, yes. This is... where is Poopak? Poopak.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How come you&#39;re so quiet? Poopak discovered a mistake in the new translation on this page, 559.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, of course, you know the rule. God doesn&#39;t make mistakes. If there&#39;s any mistake, it&#39;s our mistake.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To be specific, it&#39;s my mistake. Ok. I forgot to put one word &quot;God&quot; here. The count at the bottom of the page is alright. It&#39;s right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But as you know, at the bottom of the page, I have the count of the word &quot;God&quot; on the left side, and the total after this page on this side.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the reader can participate in the mathematical code of the Quran and realize this is God speaking to him or her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I forgot, there&#39;s one statement...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Huh? I forgot where it is now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hmm? Number 8? [65:8] Many a community rebelled against the commands...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: It says here it says God&#39;s law. The messenger: Okay, yeah, so that&#39;s it. It&#39;s in verse 8, I believe. But anyway, we will fix it. These are unedited pages.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lisa hasn&#39;t got to that point yet, right? Lisa and Emily. Oh, Emily marked it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, we&#39;re still working with unedited pages.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the count is perfect, and we just made a typing error. A man: Yeah, I would like to make a regression to verse number 7. The messenger: OK.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Explains divorce and observing God&rsquo;s laws leads to happiness.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Specifically, aside from what I understand, aside from the net, like it works that way,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the house he provided to the wife, he gave the man, asked what he was.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t see, I mean, I can&#39;t present my mind thinking somehow rationale more than spiritual. I try to stretch my spiritual.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, I go through my rationale anyway. And I see, for example, in verse 7, I mean, there is so much room for interpretation in the case of divorce.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And even as to what is rich and what is poor. The messenger: Yeah. Thank God. A man: You know, that&#39;s where you go to the woman and go to the man.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Thank God. A man: There&#39;s so much room for interpretation. I&#39;m just wondering how, I mean, practical conflicts are being resolved.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Well, it&#39;s really straightforward, but you said it is the rationale, it is common sense. There&#39;s a rich man and a poor man. When there is divorce, there&#39;s compensation. You must compensate the wife, the divorced wife.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you must provide for her for at least one year. This is in Sura 4. A man: Let&#39;s assume there is difference between the opinion...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Okay, there is a husband who is a millionaire and a husband who is hand to mouth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, how will they provide this alimony?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right. That&#39;s what the verse is saying. It&#39;s according to your... It&#39;s strictly between you and God, really.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You don&#39;t have to apply any of these laws, but you bear the responsibility, see? A man: ...Who arbitrates the conflict? How are...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: It&#39;s strictly between you and God. It&#39;s like everything else, like praying or fasting or drinking or gambling.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All things are strictly between you and God. God is telling you these laws. If you want to be happy, follow them. If you wanna be miserable, don&#39;t follow them. It&#39;s as simple as that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, if you are rich and you divorce your wife, you must provide according to your wealth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you are poor, then God is Merciful. He&#39;s telling you that you can only provide as much as you can. A man: But there is no immediate remedy as to whether it&#39;s fair or unfair. There is no immediate remedy to that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: It has to be fair. A man: I understand, but if it&#39;s not, there is no immediate remedy to that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Well, in Sura 4 there is arbitration. Sura 4, not verse 4, Sura 4. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In Sura 4, there is arbitration. There are provisions for everything. There are details. Sura 4 is the second longest Sura in the Quran. And it has a lot more details.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But see, these are basic rules. And just like you said, we really use our rationale, our common sense. We&#39;re doing alright. Use your rationale.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: I can&#39;t, you know, whenever I start, I try to use only my spiritual. Somehow I end up, you know, using my rationale at the same time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: There is no contradiction. Spiritual and rationale must go together.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But we have a tendency to make things difficult for ourselves. The Quran says that. The Quran says</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;if we listen to you, you&#39;ll make things more miserable and difficult for yourselves.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, God said &quot;the rich compensates according to his wealth and the poor compensates according to his abilities.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is...It&#39;s merciful that He didn&#39;t say you have to give this much or this proportion. A man: But when I was in Saudi Arabia, I knew that there were some cases that were dealt with by religious judges. The messenger: Judges, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: What did they do? A man: Well, basically they referred, you know, to the Quran to resolve these kind of issues. You know, it&#39;s very much comparable to, you know, I mean, the...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Knowledge brings us closer to the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: ...Western laws. Did you see anything... A man: You know, ...to written laws. These are, I mean, the Quran is taken as a written law.....</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: But you see, the more the human being is educated, the more he comes closer to the Quran. The more, yes, the more knowledge they acquire,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the more, I mean, they&#39;re just about to prohibit alcohol, for example. Here&#39;s a drunk captain who polluted Alaska because of alcohol.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The whole country knows the evils of alcohol. So, when they look at the Quran, they say &quot;alcohol is prohibited.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It matches the common sense. It matches their knowledge.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, this man had a ten mile wide channel. They said a child can maneuver this super tanker through those ten miles.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But he&#39;s not even a child. I mean, he&#39;s passed out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I bet you the crew was drunk also.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think it takes a clever captain to hit those rocks.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, they wouldn&#39;t do that. The guy was drunk, you know. So, what I&#39;m saying is that the more knowledge the human being acquires, the closer they get to God&#39;s laws on their own.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: Aren&#39;t you gonna go as far as getting the advice of the judges because after all we are humans.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And when it comes to dividing your own wealth, you may, it will be better (unintelligible). So, I just listen to you and (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If someone has to pass a judgment on the wealth of a guy, if it&#39;s left up to the first man,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">which is the man who is very wealthy, if someone has to step in and the wife brings the checkbook,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">what do you think this would mean?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Well, remember that believers&#39; affairs are decided by consultation. We&#39;re talking about believers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they&#39;re believers, they will be fair, and they will consult, and they will maintain...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Again, in Sura 4, like Lori mentioned, God emphasizes the amicable relations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, a husband and wife didn&#39;t get along together and decided to part. They don&#39;t have to be enemies.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, God says &quot;you must maintain the amicable relations among you.&quot; So, there will be mutual consultation and mutual contentment.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: But realistically, you mentioned about alcohol. Yeah, it shouldn&#39;t be there. It should be prohibited. The messenger: Right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Islamic Judges&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: But the reality, I&#39;m talking about... the nowadays life. I&#39;m just imagining this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Hamid, you&#39;re hung up on the time of applicability of the Quran. The Quran is applicable through any time, till the end of the world. Not nowadays.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: Are you saying we do not need Islamic judges? Is that the content of the argument? Should we go to Istanbul?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: No, actually, we do need Islamic judges. I didn&#39;t say that. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because the general public will not be as familiar with the Quran as they should be, or as they need to be. So, the Islamic judges are needed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hit somebody&#39;s car, and then so how much do I compensate that person? Then, we both go to the Islamic judge, and the person whose car I hit, he will say &quot;this cost me $800 to fix, and I lost 8 hours of work, and this and this.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, the judge will calculate that, and will tell me to compensate the person.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: I thought you said that if we are a believer, which is (unintelligible). The messenger: You&#39;ll do that, too. But then, if there is, you know, remember the judge is needed when there is dispute.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The judge is needed when there is dispute. If the person knows what he&#39;s doing, you don&#39;t need a judge.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Maximum freedom is guaranteed in the Quran, also. Let&#39;s go to 66 and Lori. Anybody is saying something?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes. 66.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lori: Verse 1.

This verse teaches us that he was indeed a fallible human being.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there are a number of verses cited that will back this up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger is given the responsibility to deliver the messages, and when he does that, he is</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in accordance with God&#39;s laws and those things are preserved.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the messenger is also a human being and is subject to the same test that everybody else is subject to, an even greater test, because with the responsibility comes, you know, the test.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And God made it this way so that we would not worship the messenger. That&#39;s God&#39;s system.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the messenger was perfect, then he would be god.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it doesn&#39;t make any sense. The messengers are just humans. Their only job is to deliver the message, to clarify.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are sent as a mercy from God to give the information to the rest of us. So, they&#39;re going to make mistakes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And again, this is to weed out those who would turn away because the messenger isn&#39;t perfect. Do you know the history of Moses?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he went to Pharaoh and Pharaoh said, you know, &quot;why should I listen to you? You stutter. You know, you&#39;re one of our slaves.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though, you know, Moses showed him all these miracles, it didn&#39;t make any difference.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that was God&#39;s will. We have to believe God and now the messenger. And we know what happened.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Christians, you know, who worshipped Jesus because it wasn&#39;t enough that he was a messenger. They wanted to make him a god besides God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it&#39;s the same thing with Muslims who worship Muhammad and they think that he was perfect. And there are all these myths and stories and legends about him that don&#39;t even make any sense. He was just a man.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And God is very careful in the Quran to point out his errors, too, not to scandalize him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, God doesn&#39;t get anything from that. But to make us realize that he was a man and don&#39;t worship him. He was just a man.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Listen to the message. It doesn&#39;t make any difference. The messengers all come with the same message, every one of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it&#39;s God&#39;s intent that they do make mistakes and they are imperfect so that we won&#39;t worship them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And to weed out those who will not listen to the messenger because they don&#39;t like him or they think that he&#39;s not perfect.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the next verse is, again there isn&#39;t anything. I remember from one time in one of our discussions in Quranic study many, many years ago. There were some people from</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">another mosque and they were talking about the Hadith and Sunnah. The importance of it was because it was history.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you know, if you read the Quran, the Quran is the greatest history.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We know what people think. We know what people thought. We know what they did under the tree and they got together and think that were in their mind. It&#39;s the greatest history.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we know here about what happened to his wives. He just told them something and they went and spread it. I mean, this is God telling us this. And it&#39;s a lesson for all of us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we&#39;re not supposed to be mean. W. &#39;re not supposed to gossip. We&#39;re not supposed to slander. You know, if something is entrusted to us, we&#39;re supposed to respect that and take heed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you can&#39;t hide from God. You know, she asked &quot;how did you know?&quot; And he said &quot;I know from God.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can&#39;t get away from anything. God is Omnipotent. He&#39;s Omniscient. He told in verse 4 to repent and that the messenger is protected against these things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And even if everybody banded together against him, God is saying that God is his ally and so are Gabriel and the righteous believers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And as far as reasons for divorce, if he divorces you, you know, in this case because of the</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">their behavior, then God will make it up to him. He&#39;ll give him a better wife.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, what we were talking about earlier is that with difficulty there is ease. And if you</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">have to suffer in some way for the cause of God, it&#39;s always made up to you. You&#39;re always rewarded because God is the Most Gracious.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And in verse 6, we&#39;re admonished to protect ourselves and our families from the hellfire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And how do we do that? We do it by, number one, being responsible for ourselves, obeying God&#39;s laws,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">obeying the commandments, fulfilling all of our religious duties, but also think to it that our families do the same thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, parents have to make sure their children know how to do the Prayers,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">make sure that the children do the Prayers when it&#39;s time for them to fast, to make sure that they fast.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Spouses have to, you know, help each other do the right thing. We&#39;re all... we all need to help each other because we all have the same weaknesses.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we&#39;re told here that once we get to the Day of Judgment, there are angels who never disobey God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And every command will be carried out and nobody will have any power to do anything else.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And on that day, we&#39;ll be told, well, God willing, not we, but those who disbelieve will be told not to apologize, that they&#39;re just being repaid for what they did.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Again, it all comes back to us. God has given us free will. The decision was ours.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once we made that decision, He helped us along in whatever that decision was.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we chose to disbelieve, He helped the disbelievers disbelieve. He actually leads them astray.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If this is their decision, then He helps them in that decision. If we choose to believe, then He helps us in our belief. He gives us the messages, the revelations, the steps to do what we have to do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And God is just. We&#39;re only requited for what we did. We&#39;re not held responsible for anybody else&#39;s sins.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A wife is not held responsible for her husband&#39;s sins. You know, parents aren&#39;t held responsible for their children&#39;s sins. We have to be responsible for ourselves and everybody else...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Any questions or comments on this section?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: (unintelligible), can we go, should we go, as far as pursuing the kids, I don&#39;t know, to Praying, or fasting, or anything?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lori: Well, obviously, you can only do so much. You can tell them to do it. You can set the example. You can make sure they do it up to a certain point.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But at some point, everybody is responsible for themselves. But, you know, if you want your children to get up and pray the Morning prayer,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and it&#39;s hard for them to do it, you might have to really work with them to do it. Maybe, not allow them to have their breakfast or something until they do their Morning prayer, or, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: When you have children, and they are not responsible, I find it (unintelligible). If we go as far as waking them up, and lining them up and say &quot;well, pray.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Enjoin children to do Salat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Do you have the translation, this translation with you? Hamid: The new one? The messenger: That&#39;s the one out here, you have there? Hamid: No.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Okay, open page 218. That&#39;s the answer to your question. The old one, the book, 218, page 218.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Verse 132, it&#39;s very important, actually. This is Hamid&#39;s question, it&#39;s very important. Remember it, and do it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What do you do with your children? Do you wanna read it for us, Hamid? Hamid: Pardon me? The messenger: Read verse 132.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: 132. [20:132] You shall enjoin your family to observe the contact prayers (Salat), and steadfastly persevere in doing so. We do not ask you for any provisions; we are the ones who provide for you. The ultimate triumph belongs to the righteous.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Well, there&#39;s the answer to your question. It says &quot;you order them, exhort them to pray and persist in doing so.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, because you&#39;re doing God&#39;s commandment, God controls your heart and their hearts, and everything will go just wonderful.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But you just have to exhort them. You have to keep telling them. My children are grown up now, but when they were young, I would ask them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&#39;re willing to do the prayers, but I had to remind them every day. If I...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I don&#39;t carry out God&#39;s commandment, and I wait until two in the afternoon and ask them &quot;did you pray the Noon?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No, we&#39;ll go pray.&quot; So, but there were no problems. Here&#39;s one of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: They were under your umbrella, economically. The messenger: Yes. Hamid: But you didn&#39;t actually give them a choice. Taking the circumstances into account, they didn&#39;t have a choice. The messenger: Yes, they did. Yes, they did.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: They could have said &quot;no, we&#39;re not gonna do it.&quot; But they didn&#39;t. It just didn&#39;t come up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I always said &quot;let&#39;s pray.&quot; And they prayed. Like I said, God controls the whole situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You just do your part, and God will do the rest. Hamid: But I can&#39;t really go along with this decision. We are not in control. The messenger: Don&#39;t. You don&#39;t have to.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: No, I realize... every time I come here, you say, well, &quot;this life is pre-recorded, and we have absolutely no power, decision-making power, and we are not responsible because everything is pre-recorded.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: I didn&#39;t say that, but it&#39;s..., go ahead. Hamid: I believe, I think every day you come to make decisions. You have to make a decision. You have to pass a judgment. The messenger: Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: And you are... The messenger: Okay, your question is &quot;what do I do with my children,&quot; right? Hamid: Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: The answer is right there in verse 132. It says &quot;you exhort them to pray and persist in doing so.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: But at that point, I&#39;m saying, can you really say that? The messenger: What else are you gonna do?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: What? I mean, why are you being negative? Why don&#39;t you... are you assuming that they will say no, right?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: I&#39;m playing the...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: I&#39;m saying the guy says &quot;I don&#39;t wanna pray.&quot; The messenger: Well, no...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: If they say that, then come back and ask me the question. But I say &quot;when you do your part, they will...&quot; because this is what... this has been my experience.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: But do you leave the choice to him or not? The messenger: Yes. Hamid: So, if he has a choice to say &quot;well, I ain&#39;t gonna pray.&quot; The messenger: Absolutely. But they never said &quot;no.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You have to keep saying... I mean, it&#39;s just, it just never came up that they said &quot;no, we&#39;re not gonna pray.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Those circumstances will not happen if you carry out God&#39;s commandment. Brothers and sisters, we are living experience, okay? It is, we speak from experience God provided.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not just my experience, all our experiences. I raised two kids, right? One of them is right there. They&#39;re all grown up now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, throughout their life, I carried out this commandment. I told them to pray.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it was never, never once did they say &quot;no, we&#39;re not praying.&quot; We didn&#39;t have... it just didn&#39;t come up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, what I&#39;m saying is &quot;you just do the, do the commandment that God gave you, and everything goes fine.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, if I was lax in doing this commandment, if I&#39;m not persisting in doing it, they will go without prayer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I will ask them, I tell them to pray, and they wait three or four days. And if I don&#39;t say pray, I will notice that they, they passed up the time for prayer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: Well, as much as I admire your children, and I agree with what, basically what you said, but still, in our lives, there are points, there are certain times that they reject</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">even the God. Even we reject it, say &quot;well, I have some doubt.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: You&#39;re, you&#39;re entitled to do that. Hamid: Well, you, okay, that&#39;s, that, those are the, actually, the points I was making my argument.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: You&#39;re talking about you or the children? Hamid: Well, anybody. Haven&#39;t you ever doubt God? The messenger: Me? Hamid: In your, in your evolution?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: I don&#39;t think I ever did. The messenger: But, but, I wasn&#39;t right the whole time. I was an idol worshiper for a long time. But I never doubted God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, anybody is entitled to doubt God, or question God, or be an atheist. So am I. I mean, but it just, it just happened that I didn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Okay. So, let&#39;s take a time when you doubt God. You say &quot;God doesn&#39;t exist.&quot; Hamid: Ok. Therefore, you&#39;re not gonna pray. The messenger: Right. Nor are you going to carry this commandment. You&#39;re gonna... you will not do this commandment.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Your life will be a mess. Hamid: Not necessarily. The messenger: Oh, yes, necessarily. Hamid: No, if you doubt God.... The messenger: It&#39;s in the same Sura, the same Sura...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: Well, let me, while you&#39;re finding that, let me remind people that God... The messenger: Tell her to keep them for 20 more minutes, we&#39;ll pay her more. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: God&#39;s law as I understand... The messenger: See, there is a law, Hamid, let me give you the Quranic law, Okay. God says &quot;you follow my laws, you&#39;re gonna have a happy life.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You disregard my message, you&#39;re gonna have a miserable life.&quot; This is what God says. Hamid: Exactly. The messenger: So, there is no way around it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: He is the authority. He gave you the mind which He never gave to none of His creatures. The messenger: Right. So, when...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: And that is the choice that in your lifetime you are going to make, back and forth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Okay. Hamid: You get to as close as you can get to Him. In this process, as we just noticed, like yourself, you were atheist or I, in my....</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: No, I was not an atheist. I was never an atheist. I never doubted God. No.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Hamid, I don&#39;t like the fact that you ask a question and then we go on to other things. Now, your question was</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;what do I do with the children,&quot; right? I gave you the answer from the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Quran is &quot;you exhort them to follow the commandment and persist in doing so.&quot; This is your part.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we&#39;re gonna go into other philosophical questions, it goes into something else. So, let&#39;s wait until the occasion comes up</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just for the sake of the people, just for the sake of the other people, so. Yeah, Susan what&#39;s...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Susan: We can look at the kids in our own lives. Well, I mean, I&#39;m always, you know, (unintelligible) and I are reminded to pray. Then, she wants to get up on her own. We don&#39;t even have to tell her anything. She wants to get up to pray. She does her prayers smooth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there are other kids, you know, (unintelligible). We have kids, you know, Aisha Baruni passed the today&#39;s...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: M&atilde; Sh&atilde; All&atilde;h. A woman: 8 years old. Susan: Sarah wants to pass tomorrow. A man: Cool. That doesn&#39;t happen, like me, Ok. I have a little sister. I tell her to pray and come to the mosque. She doesn&#39;t wanna come, but I keep saying to her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think someday she&#39;ll come here. The messenger: Yes, you bet.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: if you watch our children here in the mosque, you see them eagerly and joyfully praying. They join the prayers. So, it&#39;s no problem.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hamid: Doctor, I was just mentioning the choice. I was just emphasizing on that, underlining that. A kid&#39;s choice lives up to the adult. They can make their own decision even though it&#39;s not agreeing with my own as their guardian.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: See, it is your duty to do this commandment. Ok. Hamid: Just pass the message to them and leave it up to them, if they wanna follow it up, or if they wanna fail. The messenger: That&#39;s right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: That&#39;s right. But it is your responsibility and your job to point out to them why they should pray, why is it necessary.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You see, it is your obligation. You have duties towards your children and your family.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can&#39;t just come out of nowhere and say &quot;get up and pray.&quot; They&#39;re gonna tell you &quot;why?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You see, I mean, it&#39;s a whole life story that you&#39;re doing. You&#39;re carrying out God&#39;s commandments.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From all... Beth? Beth: I just wanna make it clear to you that Sam and I are no exception, because, I mean, when we were real little, we prayed because we felt so guilty when you asked us to pray,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t wanna lie. So, I mean, that was the only reason we prayed. And then when we got a little older, if we didn&#39;t wanna pray, we didn&#39;t pray.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, I mean, it just wasn&#39;t something that was important to us, and even for a long time we missed it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, we missed the Friday prayers and the Quranic studies, and I mean, he didn&#39;t argue with us. I mean, he told us, you know, what we should do, but, you know, he didn&#39;t punish us if we didn&#39;t do it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it just came to the point when we got a little older that we found out for ourselves, you know, what was the best, what the best thing was for us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it just comes to you in your heart. Your parents can&#39;t interfere with what&#39;s between you and God, and I thi. k it comes to a certain age where you find out for yourself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Actually, if you punish them, they&#39;ll hate it. You don&#39;t want them to hate religion and prayer and all that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">See, all you need to do... The messenger: All you need to do is carry out, you do your part.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is at the beginning of the Quran, God says &quot;you do your part, I&#39;ll do my part.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: Is that a good idea, Rashad? The messenger: What? You say the Prayer. A woman: You tell them &quot;OK, time to get up for prayer.&quot; And then I went for jumping up there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But he did say the prayers out loud, so they have to hear it anyway? The messenger: Whatever you need to do to carry out the commandments, God says here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: ...when I&#39;m to start Prayer is too loud or too quiet though? The messenger: No, she doesn&#39;t mean loud, real loud, you know. Just audible, she means audible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">OK, where are we now? Lori: Verse 8.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Verse 8. The messenger: Let&#39;s finish Sura 66.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lori: OK, we&#39;re on verse 8. The Believers Repent. [66:8] O you who believe, you shall repent to GOD a firm rep...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: A firm repentance. Did you read this before? Lori: No? No. OK. The messenger: OK.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lori: [66:8] O you who believe, you shall... Lori: [66:9] O prophet, struggle against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be stern with them. Their abode is Gehenna, and a miserable destiny.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In verse 8, we&#39;re told here to repent, because repentance is our chance.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Every day, every hour, we have the opportunity to repent, to wipe out our sins, and to start new again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God has given that to us. So, what Hamid was saying earlier that it&#39;s a daily decision to stay in God&#39;s Kingdom.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And He knows that we make mistakes. He knows that we break His commandments.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And He gives us a chance to overcome that by repentance.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if we do repent, and sincerely repent, which means you don&#39;t ever do it again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you really try to change. Then, God will remit your sins, and admit you into gardens of flowing streams, you in the Hereafter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On that day, God will not disappoint the prophet and those who believe with him. We&#39;ve been given a promise by God that if we do our part, which is what we were just talking about earlier. If we do our part, God does His part.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we&#39;ve talked about this before, there is no better guarantee or warranty than God&#39;s.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is proven. We don&#39;t have to worry about it. If we do our part, God will do His part.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the Bible, we&#39;ve talked about the verses in Luke where it says &quot;Seek God&#39;s Kingship over you and all else follow.&quot; That&#39;s all you have to do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s just do your part and everything else falls into place. And the light will radiate in front of them and to their right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we know that the light is knowledge, the presence of God. We don&#39;t want to be in the darkness. And one of the reasons for the messenger being sent to us is to help us out of the darkness and into the light.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s one of God&#39;s mercies. The light is mentioned many, many times in the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if you just think about it, it&#39;s a wonderful allegory because in the darkness, you&#39;re lost,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you can&#39;t see. There&#39;s fear, confusion. And when you leave that into the light, then everything is made apparent to you. You know what&#39;s going on. There&#39;s no more fear.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there&#39;s some verses in the Quran that on the Day of Judgment, the disbelievers who have been</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">destined for Hell will beg for some of that light. They&#39;ll be in eternal darkness.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the believers will ask God to perfect that light for them and to forgive them and acknowledge that God is Omnipotent.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And in verse 9, it&#39;s an admonition to the prophet, but again to all of us, to struggle</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh with them. A lot of times, people misunderstand what we do in this mosque.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They think that because we say the things that we say, that we&#39;re being very unfair, we&#39;re being very harsh, we&#39;re closed-minded, we&#39;re...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and some of the other things, they think, but you&#39;re right. This is what God is telling us to do because it&#39;s our responsibility.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s the responsibility of those who have the knowledge to give it to others, okay, and to fight because it&#39;s not your fight, it&#39;s God&#39;s fight.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if God, you know, sensitizes the disbelievers, that doesn&#39;t mean you go out and you do anything</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">necessarily violent, but there&#39;s ways to struggle with the truth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rashad publishes from this mosque the...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Muslim Perspective. Lori: And some of the things that are said in there... The messenger: It&#39;s fasting, Lori. It&#39;s fasting does that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lori: Oh, right. I don&#39;t know. The messenger: Go ahead. And the things that are said in there are really profound, and they just get everybody upset, you know, but they have to be said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Believers make mistakes &ndash; be Stern with disbelievers so they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t fall in the ditch&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It has to be said for those who might choose to listen to it. They have the right to hear God&#39;s messages, and they have the right to have the message clarified for them, whether they&#39;re leaders, like it or not.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s everybody&#39;s right to have that, and it&#39;s a constant struggle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And when you think about it, you&#39;re really doing them a favor, because if there&#39;s any chance that they might hear and listen and repent, then they&#39;ll be spared that terrible destiny of Hell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it&#39;s for their own good even though they dislike it. That&#39;s just human nature.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lori: Do you want me to go on? The messenger: Yeah, let&#39;s finish this. Lori: Okay. The messenger: Let me just comment since...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: It&#39;s very important to notice in verse 8 that it says &quot;O you who believe, repent to God a sincere repentance.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is directed to the believers, because the believers make mistakes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the disbelievers, that&#39;s a hopeless case, but it is the believers who repent and strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s for their own good, like Lori said. In another Sura, God says, in fact, it&#39;s Sura 4, it happens to be. God says &quot;here you are defending them in this life. Who&#39;s gonna be their advocate in the Hereafter?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it is to their own good that if somebody&#39;s gonna fall in a ditch, that you hold them by their clothes and shake him up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Be stern, otherwise they&#39;ll fall in the ditch. The messenger: Okay, go ahead. Lori: The Myth of Intercession Shattered</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[66:10] GOD cites as examples of those who disbelieved the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot. They were married to two of our righteous servants, but they betrayed them and, consequently, they could not help them at all against GOD. The two of them were told, &quot;Enter the Hellfire with those who deserved it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Examples of the Believers Pharaoh&#39;s Wife [66:11] And GOD cites as an example of those who believed the wife of Pharaoh. She said, &quot;My Lord, build a home for me at You in Paradise, and save me from Pharaoh and his works; save me from the transgressing people.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mary [66:12] Also Mary, the Amramite.

Okay, they were prophets. They were righteous, and it doesn&#39;t make any difference.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their husbands cannot intercede on their behalf. Nobody can intercede on their behalf. They&#39;re going to Hell because of their actions, for rejecting the messages that the messengers brought, even though they were their husbands. It didn&#39;t make any difference.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Sorry about that. Lori: That&#39;s okay. Lori: And that&#39;s very specific.

She was there. She was stuck in that situation. She couldn&#39;t leave, but it didn&#39;t make any difference.

You can believe under any circumstances, and she&#39;s an example for us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Mary, the mother of Jesus, she held up as an example for all the women.

It says do not... prohibits the reading of Quran in the language other than what the people understand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because it says, in fact it says, no it doesn&#39;t say that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was gonna say it sounds Chinese to them.

Here, God, our God, gives us the relativity of the time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He says a day, a day of your, a day of Heaven, Divinely day is equal to 50,000 years, your years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, we see that it may be 1,000 years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These two different scales show us that time is not absolute, it is relative.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For example, I think everything is relative to us. For example, heat is relative to our heat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have 37 Celsius degree. If the weather is more than this, it is heat to us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But if less than this, it is cold to us, the weather. For example, the density of our meat, what do you say, flesh, the density of our flesh,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it has a density. Edip: And if we touch something that has more density, we say it is hard, solid. The messenger: Solid.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: And if less than it, we say it is soft. Edip: And we compare, we compare with, we get information about our environment by our possessions, The messenger: Standards. Edip: Standards, yes, thank you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And also our standard is our life. We live about 70 years in this world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our scale is this 70 years. A fly, the standard of a fly is 3 months, about 3 months.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">3 months of a fly is equals our 50 years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: How old are dogs, Lydia? The messenger: The oldest one is how old? In human life is?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ok. So, this is what Edip means. So, the dogs escape.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: And here, in the verse 4, there is a word that has 2 or 4 meanings, 2 or 3 meanings.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Word RUH (&#1585;&#1608;&#1581;). It has been translated as report, reports, or revelation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In Quran, we can find these words used for revelation, or for Gabriel (&#1580;&#1616;&#1576;&#1618;&#1585;&#1616;&#1610;&#1604;&#1614;), an angel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Role of Angel Gabriel &ndash; explanation of theory of relativity &ndash; Angels speed &ndash; Speed of light is Slow.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It has both 2 meanings. And here, Rashad has translated it as &quot;their reports.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Do you have any questions about these 4 verses?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: May I? The messenger: I think we should point out here that Gabriel is the only, this is his only job, and he is the only one who does the job of carrying revelations from God to the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Any new information, or new revelations, something that was never known before, comes from God to this world through Gabriel.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is why one of his names is the spirit, or the revelation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because when God says &quot;I blew into Adam from My spirit, it&#39;s a word.&quot; Jesus called the word a word from God, because he was created by a word.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Be&quot; a word from God. &quot;Be&quot; and he was. The same with Adam. And Gabriel brought that word to Mary, if you remember.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, here the angels go to the first universe, carrying reports about things happening here, as well. So...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we&#39;re given the relative speed. You know, just like Lydia said &quot;the dog is 10 years, but in human terms, it would be 60 years.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We&#39;re told here that if you travel a distance in one day, the angels.... in 50,000 years, the angels will cut it in one day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In Carl Sagan&#39;s last novel, he concluded that the speed of light is very slow.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It really is, because nothing will be done in the universe if things were happening at the speed of light.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our favorite example here is the Prophet Muhammad&#39;s ascension to the first universe.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he were traveling at the speed of light, he would still be in one hundredth of the Milky Way galaxy and still be going on his way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, that did not happen. He went and came in the same night. God took him up in the same night.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: There is a famous equation about the relativity of the light. And according to this equation, when you exceed the speed of light, there is no time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The time becomes zero. The messenger: So, this is the theory of relativity, for instance.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you travel at the speed of light, time disappears.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you travel faster than the speed of light, you can go into the negative. Edip: It&#39;s wrong.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: It may be wrong. The messenger: No, not wrong. The messenger: Let us say... Let me explain it very quickly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our pictures travel at the speed of light. If you turn the light on, I will see it at the speed of light.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So the person, Mahmoud, will see this later than me, because there is a fraction of a second.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, once I turn this light on, I will see it first and Mahmoud will see it, because it is traveling at the speed of light.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our pictures travel at the speed of light. If the sun is turned off for a second, we will see this after 8 minutes, because it will take 8 minutes for the light. So,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the picture of anything travels at the speed of light. So, let&#39;s say Edip scratched his ear and then sneezed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Scratched his ear and then sneezed. Now this, somebody has taken a picture from a mile away. Let&#39;s say somebody can take a picture from a mile away.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When he scratched his ear, after a fraction of a second, the camera will see that and take a picture,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">because his picture is traveling at the speed of light. Yes? So, at the speed of light from here to there, it will take a certain amount of time,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and then after that he would sneeze. So, let us say I am here and I&#39;m gonna travel with this picture at the speed of light.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, if he&#39;s scratching his ear and I&#39;m traveling with that picture at the speed of light, I will always see him frozen in that position there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This makes sense? Because I&#39;m traveling with him at the speed of light, that picture will be still. So now,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, let&#39;s say he sneezed before he scratched his ear. So, if I go faster now at the speed of light, I will see his picture when he sneezed before that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Did I confuse everybody? So, I&#39;m traveling with him at the speed as he was scratching his ear.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, but if I travel faster than the speed of light, I will see his picture when he sneezed, which was a few seconds before he scratched his ear.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I go in the past, because I&#39;m going faster than the speed of light.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I go even faster than that, I will see him put his glasses on, which is something that happened before he scratched his ear.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, let&#39;s say even if I walked in the room as he was scratching his ear and then I take off with his picture at the speed of light, I will see what happened in the past before I came into the room.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Rashad... The messenger: This is how I&#39;m trying to simplify it. I have complicated it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Let me... The messenger: But this is what... if you go at the speed of light, then time will stand still.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I will always see him holding his... If I travel at the speed of light, time stands still.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, if I go faster, I will see what he did before I came into the room. The messenger: He sneezed, he put his glasses on, whatever happened before. Edip: May I give you an example?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Okay, confuse us more.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: 100s... 1,400 years, light years far away from us, that thing star. There are many stars that are far away, farther away.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From this star, let&#39;s think that there is a civilization or we went there. Just now, we are there. And</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we are taking the photo of this earth with a very sophisticated telescope and detailed,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we could get the picture of people, persons. And we could take the picture of Muhammad and the battle of BADR from that star.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: It is possible, but impossible. The messenger: Yes, those pictures are traveling in space now. Edip: Yes. Edip: Because, just it will... The messenger: To reach that star only now. Edip: Yes, only now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Things, that were happening on earth 1400 years ago, are reaching objects in heaven that are 1400 light years away.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s true. The messenger: Also, if that star explodes right now, we will not see it for 1400 years. Edip: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Because that&#39;s how long it will take for the speed of light to come here. The speed of light is very slow.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And what we&#39;re told here in verse 4, that the angels travel, what we spend 50,000 years traveling, our maximum speed, the speed of light, the angels will do it in one day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And by the way, this is not a fixed relationship, because it can be different.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It depends on where you are in the universe. For example, you go to the moon, your day will be 14 of our days.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is something we can do now. We can go to the moon. And you&#39;re gonna have 14 of our days in continuous day light.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then 14 nights. 14 days that equal one night on the moon. If you go to Jupiter, you&#39;re gonna have 365 days of light. The day equals one of our years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And even on earth, if you go to Alaska, you&#39;re gonna have 6 months day. No, but this is different. So, it depends on where you are in the universe, that our day is different compared to their day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Back to Edip. Edip: Verse 5, [70:5] Therefore, you shall resort to a gracious patience.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You must be patient. &quot;A gracious patience.&quot; [70:6] For they see it far away.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[70:7] While we see it very close.

If you have these three traits, then you do not belong with the worshippers, the believers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I remember my father&#39;s teacher had a debate with some of the mullahs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he trapped him into this. He said &quot;do you worry a lot?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He said &quot;yeah, we&#39;re humans. We worry.&quot; He said &quot;if something bad happens to you, do you become upset?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He said &quot;yeah, we&#39;re human beings, we do that.&quot; And then he said So, he said &quot;well, then you don&#39;t belong with the worshippers who observe the Salat prayer.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because in verse 22, it says (70:22) &#1573;&#1616;&#1604;&#1614;&#1617;&#1575; &#1649;&#1604;&#1618;&#1605;&#1615;&#1589;&#1614;&#1604;&#1616;&#1617;&#1610;&#1606;&#1614;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">except those who observe the Salat prayers. So, the lesson is that if you do observe your Contact Prayers, this will cool you down. You will not worry. You will have nothing to worry about.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No fear, no worry. And you will not be despondent when adversity happens.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You will remember what the Quran says that you may dislike something which is good for you. You may not get the job that you want, but God knows it is not good for you, and you accept that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, you will not be despondent. You will not be miserable because you didn&#39;t make it in the job interview.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So then, we have a bunch of traits of the believers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They always observe their Contact Prayers, verse 23. 24, a specific portion, 2.5% of their net income is set aside for the poor and the needy, 25.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">26, they believe in the Day of Judgment. These are all traits of the believers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">27, [70:27] They reverence their Lord&#39;s requital. They worry about it. In other words, they don&#39;t want it. They know how bad it is, just making God angry.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God doesn&#39;t get angry, by the way, but I mean, violating His commandments.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">27 28 [70:28] Their Lord&#39;s requital is not taken for granted.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, when you look at this, you&#39;ll be severe against yourself. You will not be lax.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You will judge yourself according to these criteria and make sure that you&#39;re a believer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You will be strict with yourself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Number 29, [70:29] They keep their chastity. So, I mean, you look at this verse 29 and you keep your chastity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;ll not be lax or careless.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Keeping the chastity is something that is unusual in this country. Because the society evolved so much in the last few decades.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Chasity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Maybe, I should get you the piece of paper that Phil handed me. Just one second.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s appropriate to this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s for all those born before 1945, which probably includes you only.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay, but here it says &quot;we were certainly not before the difference between the sexes was discovered. But we were surely before the sex changed. We may do with what we had.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;And we were the last generation that was so dumb as to think you needed a husband to have a baby.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No wonder we are so confused and there is such a generation gap.&quot; &quot;But we survived.&quot; OK.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think there are some other points here that along the line that &quot;we were the last generation</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that was so dumb as to think you needed a husband to have a baby.&quot; So, in other words, what happened in the last few decades is really very harmful to the people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we see what happened with AIDS, the spread of venereal diseases,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">yes, lesbian mothers. Things that those born before 1945 never heard of these things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But verse 29, the believers do not take it lightly, 29.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m writing an appendix on chastity and virginity for our children.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our children better be different from the other children. It is your responsibility to teach your children for their own good that they must be virgin on their wedding night.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I&#39;m talking about boys and girls. And I&#39;m going to show in the appendix how the happiness of your children depends on that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The price is just too high if they don&#39;t follow this verse, this very short verse, 29.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[70:29] They keep their chastity. The price is really too high.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, even from the physiological and the physical point of view, the boys and the girls, when they mature first and they are ready for... they are not ready.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, physiologically, they may have their menstruation, or they may... the voice may change, the boy&#39;s voice may change.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But physiologically and anatomically, they are not really ready for sex.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But in this country, they delve into sex without being ready, and they hurt themselves.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they pay the price when they grow up. This is from the purely physical and physiological point of view.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But from the practical point of view, God sees to it that those who violate this...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our boys and girls must be taught not to violate this. That they must keep their chastity, because when they do that, they pay from their happiness.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They will not have a happy marriage. They will not have a happy life. And, mind you, it is not easy. You must teach them that it is not easy to keep your chastity, especially in a society like this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Joe Sobran is a reporter with the Los Angeles Times, and he had a wonderful commentary only yesterday, or the day before.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He says &quot;these boys, they go out and they have sex as if there are no consequences.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the consequences are abortions, dangerous things that happen to... And the children who have...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These boys have no intention of raising them or supporting them. They create a lot of misery.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was Joe Sobran&#39;s commentary, and he is not a Muslim. But here we are reading the Quran, and God knows what is good for us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is telling us that the believers must keep their chastity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, all of you are young, and you have children who are growing, and I want to repeat</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and emphasize and re-emphasize that it is your responsibility. If you just do your part, God will do the other part.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You cannot just leave them to the world out there. You have to do your part by teaching them what the Quran is saying, what God is saying.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because if you really love them, you want them to be happy when they grow up. And one source of misery will be to break these laws.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are not physiologically ready. They&#39;ll be breaking God&#39;s law, and the price is too high.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if you... I know you do want them to be happy. So, I&#39;m going to write this appendix in detail, and you can use it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">OK. Use me to give them these instructions. It is very difficult to be a father or a mother, and you talk to children about sex.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s kind of awkward. But if you use the Quran, tell them &quot;this is what God says. Here is the appendix, read it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And God will help you and will protect them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, and emphasize to them that it is not easy. You must exert, tell them they&#39;ll have to exert a lot of control.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because the temptation is so great out there. And you are helping them this way when you tell them &quot;it is not easy.&quot; But you must exert for your own happiness and your own good.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You must exert a lot of control. You must resist. You know, they have a big thing saying, &quot;say no to drugs.&quot; But you never say &quot;say no to sex.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though it is disastrous.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Subhan Allah. OK.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, this is a shock.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes. The messenger: Because this, I think it was Valentine&#39;s Day at the university, and they distributed free condoms.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s like telling them &quot;go have sex,&quot; you know. They don&#39;t realize what they&#39;re doing and how much unhappiness they&#39;re causing to these kids.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But this is good news. Now, God is forcing. God says in Sura 41, verse 53, that God will show them His signs in the horizons and within themselves until they realize that this is the truth. This is good for us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is a big campaign in the country against alcohol. They don&#39;t do it because God said so. But they are forced by the disasters, the social disasters, and the broken families,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and the depression that is caused by alcohol, the hangovers and headaches, diseases.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, the book, there&#39;s a book in the market, a new book, that is called &quot;You Are What You Drink.&quot; I mentioned it before.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it lists unbelievable disastrous health problems from alcohol.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because it dissolves your brain. I mean, I&#39;m talking about cancer, blood pressure, heart disease, established, scientifically established.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Hmm? A woman: Liver disease. The messenger: Liver disease, of course, yes, it was known a long time ago. And the same is happening with violating this verse 29.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[70:29] They keep their chastity. The same thing is happening. There are unheard of diseases coming out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">AIDS is one of them. Uncurable.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">skin cancer (unintelligible) You&#39;re telling me that now the...

Because you have a lot of responsibility. There are lots of beautiful, wonderful kids running around here. And they must be protected.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Like I said &quot;don&#39;t worry. You just do your part.&quot; You must know that your children are in God&#39;s hand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can&#39;t be with them every time. But God chaperones your children. You are a person.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You are a person of God. And you must have that confidence. You must know that God is with your children wherever they go.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they are riding a bicycle in the middle of the street, or they are out with other people subjected to all the temptations of this society.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don&#39;t worry. Drugs or sex or accidents, your children are in God&#39;s hand and you must have that confidence.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And being the oldest of you, I raised two kids, I know that. I know, I&#39;m speaking from experience.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&#39;ve seen how much God&#39;s protection is marvelous. And they have seen how you just do your part and God will do His part in the most magnificent ways.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I didn&#39;t have relations with anybody else. In fact, this is repeated in verse 30.

It is just not worth it, violating these laws.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These are very very harsh. The punishment is very harsh. It seems out of proportion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, do you want to test it? Go ahead. You&#39;re gonna pay through the nose. If you want to abide by God&#39;s law, then you attain a lot of happiness and you avoid lots of problems.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay, any questions?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Charity and showing off.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right, they&#39;re being selfish.

But the criterion is whether the person is cutting a portion of his money and giving it to the poor or not.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The minimum is 2.5%. If the person is giving away at least 2.5% of his or her money to the poor, then they&#39;re alright.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Farhad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">We must observe &ldquo;Umrah and Hajj&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes.

Or is very important. Yes. Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is... the Quran is so accurate that you have to pay attention to what Farhad is just saying. OR or AND.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is a verse that says &quot;you shall observe Hajj and Umrah. And I have translated it, maybe even in the old translation, OR Umrah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But we&#39;re supposed to observe... in pilgrimage, there are two things that must be observed, Hajj and Umrah. They must be done.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is a similar... the difference is just a dash.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">WA (&#1608;&#1614;) or AW (&#1571;&#1614;&#1608;). That&#39;s the difference. You really have to pay attention to these things. Edip: Yes. Here, if you have spouses, you don&#39;t have negligence.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Right. The messenger: See, because you either got married or you either got together without the benefit of marriage.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t wanna tell you that joke again.

The messenger: That&#39;s possible. But I know that they &quot;simplified&quot; the Quranic Arabic, and they wrote it in the modern. Edip: In Turkey, also.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Also in Turkey? Edip: Yes. Misspelling.

The answer is yes. The Prophet Muhammad was given specific instructions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Every time Gabriel released Quran from Muhammad&#39;s soul to Muhammad&#39;s memory, he gave him instructions as to where these three or four verses belong.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he wrote down those verses and he put instructions next to them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, when he died, he left the complete Quran, but not in the order that God wanted for the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He left the Quran with instructions on the side as to which Sura goes after what Sura and which verse goes after which verse.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Exactly. They followed the instructions. They put the Quran together, but then Satan tricked them into adding two verses.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that was during Uthman&#39;s time. And this triggered the war between Ali and his family and the Umayyads.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: That&#39;s the thing that you&#39;re referring to in the...

There were 50 years of bitter war, but unfortunately the Umayyads won.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, we got their version.

And then the closer they&#39;re getting, you shout louder and louder and then you just wanna run to them and hold them from falling off.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is clearly what I remember from Khutba and this is what I get, this message from this surah that here is this man trying to shake these people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">First, he gives them the message and he basically tries to do his best, you know, to carry on the message</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and relay it, but these people are just deaf and blind. And he tells them that God has created you in stages and this is the most beautiful part. Aya 17, it says</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[71:17] And GOD germinated you from the earth like plants. And this is what I find about the Quran. It&#39;s a book of laws.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s a book... it teaches us about so many things, about the past, the future, the present.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It also has poetry in it and this is what really touched me. Also, Aya 16 which is</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[71:16] He designed the moon therein to be a light, and placed the sun to be a lamp. [71:17] And GOD germinated you from the earth like plants.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is so true because God created us from the pottery clay. And here is a plant that you see every day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you have a plant and take care of it and water it, you see how it germinates and how it just basically comes up. And new leaves that you see, it&#39;s bright, you know, green and then it turns dark green and it gets bigger.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is how we are. We were a baby. And we grow up and all these beautiful children that we have here. These are all signs from God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And again, people are blind to see all these beautiful things. And God has created this earth and He has made it habitable for us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And these roads and we see new highways coming, new freeways and wonderful roads that we have always building on and on and on and on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And these are everything that we have been blessed with by God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And He clearly says &quot;obey Me and follow Me.&quot; Obey God and follow this message and you will be taken care of.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You will have a wonderful life, you know. God will shower you generously with rain. What is rain? It&#39;s a sign of bounty.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rain comes and, you know, all the plants grow and we have food.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the money that&#39;s provided and the children that we&#39;ll have, IN SHAA ALLAH, and orchards and streams, all of these are beautiful.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We sit by a stream and we enjoy the beauty of it by the greenery or whatever, anywhere in the nature.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, why shouldn&#39;t you, as Aya 13 says, [71:13] Why should you not strive to reverence GOD?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why shouldn&#39;t you? These are all these wonderful things that God is promising you. And these are all the facts that I&#39;m telling you about, the moon and the sun and, you know, how you germinate like plants</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and how you are created in stages within the womb and outside as we grow into adulthood.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why not do it? And again people wouldn&#39;t listen. So finally, he gets so frustrated and he just turns to God and says in Aya 21,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[71:21] ...&quot;My Lord, they disobeyed me, and followed those who were even more corrupted when blessed with money and children.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Here we go, money and children. We see many examples of this in this society, any society.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You think that&#39;s the only thing that&#39;s important. Then, you have children and they become the center of your life.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you strive so hard for them. You don&#39;t have any rest at all sometimes because you&#39;re working night and day for your children and to money and the greed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you just basically may forget about God. God willing, we&#39;ll always stay on the path that we walk.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, he says &quot;God, if these people go on without any retribution, they&#39;re gonna keep on being corrupted with money and children.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they will have terrible schemes&quot; as it says in Aya 22. And they didn&#39;t wanna abandon their god. They didn&#39;t wanna let go of their own idols.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And God...And in the Sura...in Aya 23 it says, &quot;Do not abandon Wadd...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and I think, I don&#39;t know what those things are, but I think they&#39;re idols.... or something</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: The names of their idols.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apamea: And people were just trying to mislead each other and preach to each other and try to tell each other that &quot;hey, don&#39;t let go of these idols. These are the ones that are important to you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And again, as it says in 24, [71:24] &quot;They misled many. Therefore, let the wicked plunge deeper into loss.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&#39;ll just go deeper and deeper into what&#39;s worse for them, the worst things that could happen to them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they will always stay in their sin. So, what&#39;s waiting for them is the hellfire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there will be no helpers at all to protect them from God. Because God&#39;s wrath is great and God&#39;s promise is great.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His bounties are fantastic and He tells us &quot;hey, either go the way of righteousness</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">or you go the way of sinfulness and being a disbeliever and idol-worshiping.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you will deserve hellfire. And so Noah turns to God and says, [71:26] ....&quot;My Lord, do not leave a single disbeliever on earth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He really did his best to try to preach to these people and let them know about this good information.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And what will happen, if these people stay on, [71:27] &quot;....they will only mislead your servants and give birth to nothing but wicked disbelievers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we are told at the mosque here how the children are assigned to particular parents</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and how parents are responsible to teach the good word, you know, what they know about God to their children and pass on the information.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And to let them, to always remind them of their prayers, that they have to do their prayers on time and read the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But in a family that there are with disbeliever parents, what do you expect from these parents?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&#39;re not gonna sit there and talk about God in front of the children. Obviously the children are not going to be informed at all.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so what&#39;s gonna happen, these idol worshippers, these disbelievers will mislead</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the servants of God possibly and give birth to nothing but wicked disbelievers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the chain will just go on and on and on. And so he asks forgiveness for himself and his parents and other people who have come to</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">who have come to his home and try to accept, you know, they accepted the word.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the believing men and women. And Noah says in Aya 28, [71:28] &quot;...But do not give the disbelievers anything but annihilation.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Basically just puts it straight. Annihilation will be awaiting them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And as we know, the flood came. Even his wife and son were the disbelievers there among the crowd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And as we learned in the other chapters that God told him &quot;make the ark and you&#39;ll have a pair of the animals.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the believers all went with him and they were saved. And that was God&#39;s promise to all these believers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so he told his son &quot;come on with us.&quot; And his son thought that he could be safe on top of whatever it was, on top of someplace high.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he thought that he could be safe from this flood. But the flood came and destroyed everything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Noah and the believers were all saved. So, I think that this Sura was very self-explanatory, very direct, poetic in some areas.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And basically put us in touch with our creation. And, you know, how hard this messenger was truly working to inform the people of the good message.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Poopak?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Any questions on Sura 71?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay, I have a couple of comments, as usual.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Are you concerned about these fellows? A woman: It reminds me of the....</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Noah&rsquo;s disbelieving people and their example repeated today. Message one and the same.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: It says &quot;those who enter my home as a believer.&quot; So, if they enter his home as a believer, we don&#39;t know what (unintelligible). The messenger: It means &quot;join.&quot; It means &quot;join.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: But he was 950, it&#39;s better to (unintelligible) 1,000.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&#39;re pretty old. They&#39;re over 40.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay, well, I think every one of you is a Noah. You&#39;ve all gone through this experience.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And what we learn from this Sura is that the human being is a human being is a human being.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From the very first day, from the time of Adam, the human beings have been the same.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Each one of you have gone through the same experiences that Noah went through.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can be as young as Naomi, and you can go through a lot of the same things that Noah went through. Naomi is not 1,000 yet, or even 700 years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But she went through it. She was telling me about this law school student and how she... He&#39;s only one of many that she talked to, I know that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the reaction... she talked about a message from God that&#39;s mathematically coded, superhuman, definitely from God,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">tells us exactly how to be saved. And then he says &quot;oh, this is good for you, but for me, I would like to see this and that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, his response was the same response that Noah got.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you notice in verse 7, he&#39;s saying, [71:7] &quot;Whenever I invited them to be forgiven by You,...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For heaven&#39;s sake, you&#39;re inviting the people to be forgiven. You&#39;re inviting them to be perfectly happy in this life and forever.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;re not asking them for money, but they are... oh, I got this here for you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I cleaned this two days ago. This is the live picture outside the mosque.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there are here now about 76 bugs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some of them are pretty big, you know. You don&#39;t know how they got in there. They worked so hard to go in there and burn in Hell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is what the people are doing. They work so hard to avoid Heaven and to go to Hell. They pay whatever price it takes to go to Hell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they work very hard for it. So, this is... God gave us this as an example.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s very difficult. On your way out, just look at it and see how they got in there. They had to work very hard to burn and go to Hell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is what the people are doing, since the time of Noah. Now, Noah was the most probably the first... well, he was the first prophet and probably the first messenger after Adam.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All the people on earth were living around what is the Dead Sea is now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Dead Sea is the remnant of the Noah&#39;s flood. So, this gives an idea how primitive, how early in history this was.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the human being was exactly the same.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Another thing, the message, another lesson we learn is that the message has been almost one and the same.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You see it here in verse 3. Worship God alone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Reverence Him, and obey, obey Him. So, this is the message that every single messenger said &quot;Worship God alone&quot;, &quot;Worship God alone&quot;, from day one to the end of the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is the only message that God is sending to us in order to be redeemed. In order to make up for our crimes we committed billions of years ago.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is the other lesson. But the message is one and the same from that time. And then there is a scientific miracle that Apamea didn&#39;t emphasize enough, or maybe didn&#39;t notice.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In 16, God says, [71:16] He designed the moon therein to be a light, and placed the sun to be a lamp.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&#39;s a difference. A lamp is a source of light.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But if I have a mirror here, and the mirror reflects this light, the mirror will give light.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can send light to that dark room over there, but the mirror will not be a source of light.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it&#39;s very clear in verse 16.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God is telling us, and this is consistent throughout the Quran, that the sun is a source and the moon is reflective.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The material of the moon is very special. This grayish material is very reflective. And this is what Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin said when they landed on the moon.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They held it in their hands, in their gloves, excuse me, and they said &quot;it&#39;s quite reflective.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s a strange material, but God made it that way. God designed it so Apamea can see it through her curtain.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it&#39;s amazing how much light comes and is reflected by the moon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">MOC &ldquo;I wish I could have translated it better&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What else?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&#39;s another significant matter in 25. We learn a very good lesson here. 25 says,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[71:25] Because of their sins they were drowned and assigned to the hellfire. They found no helpers to protect them from GOD.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, the Arabic, I wish I could have translated it better. I like this translation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s better than the first one, to me. But I wish it was better, because the verse implies that they knew, which is true.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">People know at the time of death, if they&#39;re going to Heaven or Hell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They know, and then after that it is either a nightmare, continuous nightmare, from which there is no awakening.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, the awakening is worse, because they wake up to the real Hell. Or, it&#39;s a beautiful dream, depending on how they redeem themselves or not.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, verse 25 teaches us that the people know at the time of death. And this is... throughout the Quran, we learn that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The angels tell the person, the angel of death tells the person whether he or she is heading for Heaven or Hell at the time of death, so they know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Are there any questions on this Sura? A man: Do we have any information on what language is throughout the new and old Testaments?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Most probably Aramaic language used during time of Noah. Salat did not exist during Noah time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Most probably Aramaic. The messenger: Aramaic is the oldest scriptural language, and it is a different language even now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have a tape here that teaches Aramaic, and it&#39;s very close to the Arabic. It&#39;s the same alphabet, the same order as Arabic, and the words that we use here in this mosque, a lot of them are Aramaic.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For example, the name of God, Allah. That was the name in Aramaic. This is the name that all the prophets and messengers used. This is a very good question, so pay attention.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All the prophets used the same name for God, Allah. Noah, Job, Abraham, Moses, Jesus.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The tape I have specifically is about the language of Jesus, and I have a book that was with me, and God&#39;s name was Allah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is what all the prophets and messengers used for the name of God, from Adam until the end of the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The prayer was Salat. In Noah&#39;s language, in Adam&#39;s language, in Abraham&#39;s language, in Jesus&#39; language, in our language, there are many things in common.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have a book here, if you want to see it later, or hear the tape I just left you here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, most probably the language is Aramaic.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, not the Sabbath. Not the Sabbath. In fact, this is another good question, because you do not see the order to observe Salat before Abraham.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You notice here, Noah did not say &quot;I want you to observe the Salat prayer and the Zakat charity, like Abraham.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You see it only for Abraham and (unintelligible). You don&#39;t see it before Abraham at all.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You notice here, verse 2, [71:2] He said, &quot;O my people, I am a manifest warner to you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[71:3] &quot;To alert you that you shall worship GOD, reverence Him, and obey me. [71:4] &quot;He will then forgive you.... And so on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So throughout the Quran, Noah was always saying &quot; just believe in God&quot; because the people were so primitive</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that believing in God would have assured them enough growth to make it to Heaven.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But then the duties in Islam came through Abraham, or the Jews, or Christians, and us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Noah was one of the messengers or prophets? The messenger: Yes, he&#39;s named in the Quran as a prophet.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Scripture-based. Adam was a prophet because he delivered the message, a new message which was not in existence before.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: So, because Noah delivered this new message, he&#39;s referred to as a prophet?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: He had a new message. He had new information that the people didn&#39;t have before. He delivered it to them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&#39;s named in the Quran as a prophet.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You mean the words? Yes. Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Maybe, it was Al-F&atilde;tehah. We don&#39;t know. The word that we know couldn&#39;t mean Al-F&atilde;tehah, because the Ibrahim Al-F&atilde;tehah is very close to what we read Al-F&atilde;tehah now, the sound and meaning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">new world had &ldquo;no bacterial viruses&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What we&#39;re taught is that Adam was given words, so he would be redeemed.

In Iran, we were taught in the school, you know, we had the class of Deen, which was religion. But we were only studying Islam.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we were always taught that there&#39;s only one God and he has no children.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And to me, and I didn&#39;t really know anything about Christianity when I was in Iran until when I was 13.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then I learned about it. And to hear the fact that Christians have made Jesus, you know, so big and the son of God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you ask them, you know, &quot;you&#39;re referring to Jesus as the son of God.&quot; And then they go on talking about Christianity and all of a sudden they say &quot;the Lord.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I said &quot;who&#39;s the Lord?&quot; &quot;Jesus Christ.&quot; And I said, wait a minute, wait a minute. You were just telling me that you&#39;re saying &quot;Christ is the son of God.&quot; And now you&#39;re saying &quot;he&#39;s God.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He can either be the son or he can be God. You cannot be, you know, two things in one.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they were saying &quot;oh, that&#39;s different.&quot; But God and Jesus are different. And you can&#39;t even compare this to a simple example of &quot;hey, you can&#39;t be two people&quot; and you know...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, that was really outrageous to me. And to this day, I still have discussions with Christians who practice their faith.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it just goes back to the same thing. &quot;Hey, listen&quot; and I say &quot;God has no son, no mate, nothing,&quot; you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It just goes back and forth and we never get anywhere. Because they just believe what they believe. But here&#39;s a jinn. You know, the jinns are saying</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[72:3] &quot;&#39;The Most High is our only Lord. He never had a mate, nor a son. It makes me feel so good when I read about these jinns because, you know, these jinns are Muslims, you know. And I think...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so many times at the mosque here, we&#39;re taught that, IN SHAA ALLAH, we&#39;ll turn our jinn into a Muslim.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, our worth of righteousness.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So that&#39;s the point for the Christians, the Aya 3. And again, how these foolish people utter nonsense about God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And how they go to the jinns and they want strength from them. And, you know, to seek power from the jinns reminds me of devil worshipers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know, maybe I&#39;m wrong, but I think of it like witch power, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All that stuff that people do when you see on TV, all these talk shows. They concentrate on it so much for a couple of months.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it makes you aware of what&#39;s really going on. Someone that you may be dealing with every day. You don&#39;t know what their practices are. And this person from Pima College, you know, the director.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And here they are showing on TV now, you know, that she practices devil worshiping and this and that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So they&#39;re trying to get power from the jinns. Or getting strength from Satan. But it&#39;s all nonsense.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And every time people think that there&#39;s never gonna be another messenger.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they don&#39;t appreciate the messenger until the messenger is gone. Like when you don&#39;t appreciate a talented actor, you know, or singer or something until they&#39;re gone. And then you just basically make them so big.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is really like that. Who was it... after Joseph? Well, no... who was it... after some messenger</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that they thought there was gonna be no other messengers. The messenger: It was Joseph, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that is not true. And we see it continuously, messenger after messenger, prophet after prophet.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, these jinns are trying to go towards Heaven and peek in and see what&#39;s going on there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there are guards there and projectiles. And they try to listen and &quot;boom,&quot; there&#39;s a projectile coming to them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they basically cannot get in and it&#39;s just impossible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But you know, this makes me wonder.

And here they are mentioning us, the Earth, the inhabitants of Earth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And what God&#39;s plan is for us. They don&#39;t know. We don&#39;t know. And later on, we learn that not even Muhammad knows what&#39;s gonna happen to us. All they do is give us the message and tell us what&#39;s awaiting us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But they don&#39;t know what&#39;s gonna happen to each one of us, particularly. And the jinns say &quot;some of us are righteous and some of us are less than righteous and follow various paths.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know, I kind of find this interesting how you sort of perceive jinns as bad guys.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And here are the bad guys that are turning good.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the good group are saying &quot;some of us are righteous and some are less than righteous.&quot; Again, they&#39;re dividing again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, it&#39;s just division within division to me. And we&#39;re following various paths.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they are so aware. They know that they can never run away from God on Earth or anywhere else. You cannot get away from God. God is there. God is with you, everywhere you are.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Through goodness in life, through adversity in life, God is always with us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the angels that are assigned to us will always remain with us. And these jinns are very well aware of that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[72:13] &quot;&#39;When we heard the guidance, we believed therein. Anyone who believes in his Lord will never fear any injustice, nor any affliction.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is such a reassurance to me again and again, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have the guidance here and we believe in it. And what a wonderful feeling it is. And I can feel what these jinns are saying. They&#39;re spirit, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How wonderful they feel. You know, they&#39;re so happy about what&#39;s happened to them. And they are so sure about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they&#39;re saying anyone who believes in his Lord will never fear any injustice.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So many times through life, recently for me for instance, a few things may happen that are a few headaches. And as believers we think &quot;okay, wait a minute. What did I do wrong?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;ve had this cold for two weeks, you know. And I&#39;ve taken a whole thing of penicillin or whatever. And it&#39;s still staying in my nose. And it&#39;s driving me wild, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I know what was the problem. And as I let go of thinking so much about that particular problem, which is with my education.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some problems happened with the committee and this and that. And I was so preoccupied with it. And I would cry about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I was like &quot;oh, my life is ruined now.&quot; And you think like &quot;this is it. This is it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just because this process in my life has been delayed for a period of time, which is unknown to me,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My life is ruined. My future is ruined. I will not have any career. I&#39;ll just, you know, be at the hospital doing what I&#39;m doing. And this injustice.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The lady drops out of my committee just like that. And that was an injustice to me, you know. And I was fearing that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, I fell into it for a while. And my cold came on. And I was like &quot;boom, this is it. This is what&#39;s happened to me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And two weeks later, three weeks later, I feel like I&#39;ve let go of it. And I feel like &quot;okay, whatever happens, happens. I&#39;m not gonna worry about it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And here I&#39;m trying to be a submitter again and saying that I will not fear any injustice nor any afflictions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And God willing, things will clear away for me. And for the believers, this is the chance that we have. This is the privilege, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we can... God&#39;s promise is always true. And He never fails us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, again, I can put my trust into this Aya here. And, again, it will give me strength. Thank God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Aya 14, [72:14] &quot;&#39;Among us are the submitters, and among us are the compromisers.&#39;&quot; As for those who submitted, they are on the right path.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is, again, a factual type of a thing. Staring at us here, you submit and you&#39;re on the right path. Compromising will not get us anywhere.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, as it says in ayah 15, [72:15] As for the compromisers, they will be fuel for Gehenna.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A person, a lay person out on the street, if they come and read this book, I mean, it just informs you about the past, the present of what you&#39;re supposed to do, and what&#39;s gonna happen to your future.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, thank God for me, it was very clear. And the more I read it, the more it gives me guidance and strength to follow Islam, to follow God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it basically tells us, here&#39;s a jinn telling the story of, you know, &quot;some of us are true submitters and some of us are compromisers, but we know what&#39;s gonna happen to the compromisers.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&#39;re gonna be fuel for Gehenna. And who wants to be....?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apamea: Water gives life. Water gives life.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">During the month of Ramadan, we were basically thirsty rather than hungry, and I noticed that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So water is, again, the source of life here. We will be tested, definitely. And we know that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Throughout the chapters, we are, it&#39;s mentioned to us several times, testing and even little quizzes as one of the brothers mentioned.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if we disregard, [72:17] ....As for him who disregards the message of his Lord, He will direct him to ever increasing retribution.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that is so clear. And who wants that retribution? I mean, if we have a bad day here, a headache, this and that, we think it&#39;s horrible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And just to imagine that it&#39;s magnified so much for eternity, the retribution,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know, or a nightmare. You get up in the morning and you think about the nightmare that you have and the problems that you felt in your night.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And just imagine that you would be living in that nightmare for eternity. That&#39;s just incredible to me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I don&#39;t want to be there. And I don&#39;t know how some people are so deaf and blind, knowingly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This...You put them, this in front of them and they don&#39;t believe in it. They think it&#39;s just a myth. Or they can&#39;t think that far. Like Naghmeh was telling you about her friends.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They can&#39;t think that far as to Heaven and Hell. And some Muslims call it, some people like in Iran, you know, they call themselves Muslims, but they say &quot;oh, we don&#39;t believe in Heaven or Hell.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, you don&#39;t know. But you tell them &quot;this is the Quran.&quot; And they were raised with the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But then again say &quot;I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t believe in that stuff. This is the life. This is it. This is the real thing.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they try to hold on to what they&#39;ve got. But even at the hospital, I see this every day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You see a doctor, a patient there who was a doctor, and they&#39;re ill.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What happened to all that dignity? What happened to all that money? Sometimes you don&#39;t see one single parent or family member there, one single friend.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&#39;re just laying there without any food. They can&#39;t eat. Tubes are just, you know, all over the place. And what happened to their diet?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, it&#39;s not important. And I come home and I tell Naghmeh &quot;your health is the most important thing.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, being in Islam is so good. And what I tell my patients every day is &quot;thank God this, thank God that.&quot; And God willed he&#39;ll get out, and the patient will get out today. And this and that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that, amazingly enough, that gives a lot of people a lot of strength. And sometimes I see tears coming down their eyes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because all of a sudden they&#39;re reminded of God again. And that&#39;s the whole story.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just believe in God, and He&#39;ll promise all these wonderful things. And you submit, and you&#39;re guided to the right path. And hey, everything&#39;s gonna work out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Your health is gonna be there. Your happiness is gonna be there. Even you&#39;re gonna have a wonderful family and children. You&#39;re gonna have a wonderful job.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;re not gonna have any headaches. You&#39;re not gonna. have any colds that will last for two or three weeks. And you don&#39;t have to take any pills twice a day. And this is a promise to us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And finally, Aya 18. [72:18] The places of worship belong to GOD; do not call on anyone else beside GOD.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Any other other name. This is very clear. Extremely clear.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we mentioned to the Mohammedans, we know. I&#39;ve never been to the mosque, and I don&#39;t wanna claim that I have been. But this is what I&#39;ve heard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Keep your Chasity&rdquo; explained.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The name of Muhammad is mentioned besides God. And if they claim that they read this Quran and they know it so well, they should look at this Aya. And this is a sign for us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sometimes when we encounter people who worship prophet Muhammad, we can just refer them to this Aya.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[72:18] The places of worship belong to GOD; do not call on anyone else beside GOD. And thank God that this is what we know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: I&#39;m gonna come back and explain a little more about this. It&#39;s really very clear.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The location of this Sura is here, this mosque. I&#39;m gonna talk to you about that. But before this, I see Amir is falling asleep.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&#39;s joining the sleeping corner there. I&#39;m gonna give him a quiz. Because the subject I&#39;m gonna talk about 10 more minutes. Last time, we didn&#39;t talk about it enough. Amir asked me a question. I knew it was coming.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He said &quot;what does it mean to keep your chastity?&quot; I knew it was coming. So, I answered him. I wonder if he remembers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have the quiz for you, Amir. What does keep your chastity mean?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Well, listen. Your dad doesn&#39;t know. I don&#39;t care. Your dad is old enough. I don&#39;t care if he knows or not. I wonder if you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sometimes the older people don&#39;t know, Amir. See, this is... You know, Amir reminds me of a joke when...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This shows the generation gaps. How much more educated the new generations are.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This father, his son reads, is coming close to the age of maturity. So,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he puts his hand on the shoulder of his son and says &quot;son, I think it is time now to talk about the facts of life.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the boy said &quot;okay dad, what do you wanna know?&quot; So, Amir is saying the same thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay, Amir, what is keep your chastity? I thought so.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Try to remember. You can give me any idea. Do you have any idea about it?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is why I wanna talk about it for ten more minutes. Ok. I&#39;m gonna repeat it and I&#39;m gonna ask you again next week, okay?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, you better remember. Keep your chastity means you keep yourself for your wife.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;re gonna grow up someday and have a wife and children, right?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you want that person to be very special. So, you want to keep yourself for your wife.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;re not gonna have any relationship with any other girl until you meet the girl that you&#39;re going to marry that is your wife.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is what keep your chastity means. Because in this country, we live in a strange environment here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as the children hit five, they start talking about boyfriends and girlfriends.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, they can do this, but they will pay a lot. It&#39;s too expensive for them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because when they do this, they&#39;re breaking God&#39;s law. And they have to pay for it when they grow up. They have a miserable life with their spouses.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this means the boy keeps himself until he doesn&#39;t go for all this dating business and boyfriend business and girlfriend business.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You have to resist that temptation. You&#39;re gonna be under a lot of temptation in the next years or so, even maybe now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Do you have girls who like you at school? No?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Do you like any girls at school? See, this is what I mean. See, this is what I mean. You have to resist the temptation to reach for those girls and touch them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">See, because you want to keep yourself for the one that will share your life forever.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if you do this, which is very difficult, it&#39;s not easy. You do this, God will guarantee you a perfect life.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our girls also have to keep themselves until they have the man that will be their husband.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">See, I know Poopak is listening. Don&#39;t be embarrassed. We all grow up and we get married.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But because we want you to be happy, you have to forget about the traditions of this country.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They pay a high price for this. They call for the temptation, the boyfriend and the girlfriend and all this business.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they think they&#39;re having fun, but then they pay dearly for it. When they grow up, we have to pay for all breaking God&#39;s law. Every time we break God&#39;s law, we have to pay for it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, if you want to be happy, and we want you to be happy, you must resist the temptations in this country.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you must have your own... God&#39;s law rules your life. Because, see, verse 13 here says when... No, not 13.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, 13. [72:13] &quot;&#39;When we heard the guidance, we believed therein. Anyone who believes in his Lord will never fear any injustice, nor any affliction.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, if you want a life that doesn&#39;t have any fear, no affliction, no misery, you must be very strong.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You must resist all temptation to fall for the things that happen around us here and in other places.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[72:13] &quot;&#39;When we heard the guidance, we believed therein... This is the guidance from God, and he&#39;s telling us &quot;you must keep yourself with your spouse.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you&#39;re a boy, you must keep yourself, you don&#39;t touch another girl until the person will be your wife forever.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if you&#39;re a girl, you keep yourself untouched until the person that will be your husband.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, you&#39;ll have a very happy life. You&#39;ll be proud of yourself. If you fall for the temptation, you&#39;re gonna be ashamed of yourself for the rest of your life, if you didn&#39;t keep yourself with the one that married you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is what verse 13 means. And God wants you to learn this. Last time, remember the commandment, &quot;you must keep your chastity.&quot; This is what it means.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was verse 29 of the last Sura. And now in verse 13, God is telling us, [72:13] &quot;&#39;When we heard the guidance, we believed therein.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The guidance is &quot;you don&#39;t follow the traditions other than God&#39;s law.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;re gonna be in school. You&#39;re gonna hear about boyfriends and girlfriends, and they will come and invite you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They will want to touch you and all these things. But you must tell them &quot;I follow God&#39;s law and I cannot go along with these traditions. I have my own traditions.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if you&#39;re strong, then you&#39;re guaranteed a perfectly happy life. And pass it on to all your Muslim friends.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you really care for them and you want them to be happy, this is what you pass on to them. Okay?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Jinns visited the Masjid. Quranic Events past and future.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These are the 10 minutes. I&#39;m gonna ask Amir next week and maybe ask the two of you. So, you remember that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, no, no, no. I don&#39;t wanna scare you away. Don&#39;t worry. I know you&#39;ll never forget because you want to be happy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay, Sura 72 teaches us about the jinns.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it has to do with our mosque here because of the following reasons.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You see, verse 4 tells us that these jinns were companions. I want to correct something that Apamea may have missed, again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Remember, jinns are free companions of humans.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our companions are not called jinns yet. They will be when we die and they are free, they become jinns.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the jinns that heard this Quran were passing by on 6th street and they decided to walk into Masjid Tucson.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they heard the Quran. And they are jinns who were companions of Christians, believing that God had a mother, Mary, and a son, Jesus, and so on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because verse 4 says, [72:4] &quot;&#39;It is the foolish among us who used to utter such nonsense about GOD.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The nonsense is in verse 3. [72:3] &quot;&#39;The Most High is our only Lord. He never had a mate, nor a son.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are surprised. They walked in here. And they heard the Quran and they heard about the mathematical coding.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they noticed the truth. And they believed. And they now realized that this nonsense that God has a mate and a son is really nonsense.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And only the foolish will believe that. So, this Sura has to do with us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And... [72:1] Say, &quot;I was inspired that a group of jinns listened, then said, &#39;We have heard a wonderful Quran.*</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can say here, &quot;Say (O, Rashad),...&quot; if you wanna be accurate. I can&#39;t afford to be subtle about it anymore.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Quran did not exist during the Prophet Muhammad&#39;s time. Did you know that?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Therefore, this does not apply to that time. The Prophet lived until he was 40 without any Quran, not one letter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And when he was 55, he had only about one third of the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Quran was still being revealed until a few months, maybe weeks, before he died.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Quran was not in the format that God intended for the world. It was written in the chronological sequence.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This Sura has the root name &quot;Rashada&quot; four times, more than any other Sura.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if you add the gematrical value of Rashad Khalifa to the number of verses... the number of Sura, and the number of verses, you have a multiple of 19.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rashad (&#1585;&#1588;&#1575;&#1583;) is 505, Khalifa (&#1582;&#1604;&#1740;&#1601;&#1607;) is 725, the number of Sura is 72, and the number of verses is 28.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, we have a lot of mathematical confirmation that this Sura is about us, for this mosque here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That the jinns wandered in here, and they are here with us now, listening. They are very regular as far as the Quranic studies are concerned.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t wanna spook out anybody, but they love it. This is why you read that among us are the Muslims, and among us are the compromisers. Verse 14.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Muslims means total submitters to what God says. There is no compromising.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, it was applicable. It was information about jinns. It was a lot of knowledge. But it will not apply to a place in Egypt, for example, or in Iran, or in Pakistan.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the jinns who are walking around there, will not believe that God has a mate and a son, generally.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Quran is valid for all times, but there are certain things, for example,... For example, Rabbi Judah the pious is mentioned in 46:10.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rabbi Judah was in the 11th century. The Quran came down in the 7th century.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, there were 4 centuries before Rabbi Judah. There is a Sura about the smoke, which hasn&#39;t happened yet.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it&#39;s still valid, and it is consistent with the punishments that came to the previous generations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gog and Magog has not reappeared yet.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The splitting of the moon happened only in 1969. So, all these things are still valid and there is a lot of information in all of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But this Sura now, this Sura is about Masjid Tucson.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These are the jinns who wandered in here, they know the truth. There are jinns who are lost and ignorant and just as Christians, as any Christian, or Jewish as any Jew, or Atheists as any Atheist.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: This is a group of jinns who came in here and they believed. A woman: These are jinns who not converted...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: No, they were converted afterwards. Yes. So, the jinns do change afterwards.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Jinns giving more time to explore. Jinns explained in detail.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was wondering about this for a while. Because the jinns are so strong with Satan, initially. They need... God gave them a longer period of time and more chance of seeing the universe.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">See, this whole creation is for the humans and the jinns to redeem themselves.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We were kind of marginal, but the jinns were still firmly with Satan.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, their opinion is stronger on the side of Satan. And God is giving them more of a chance.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because on the Day of Judgment, the humans and the jinns who go to Hell will not have any excuse.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The jinns will not say &quot;if you gave us enough time we would have abandoned our strong alliance with Satan.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They cannot say that. A woman: So what is... when you say they read the Quran when they... Because it is also in the Quran. I understand this that they read the Quran...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: No, this is a result of them reading the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: They knew... in other words, they reached the conclusion that is... A woman: Oh, they reached the conclusion? The messenger: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: Ok. So, it&#39;s not going to happen... more like they now... The messenger: They knew as a result of reading the Quran because the first verse says</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[72:1] &quot;....a group of jinns listened, then said, &#39;We have heard a wonderful Quran.*</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, when they heard the wonderful Quran, they learned a lot. Those were ignorant jinns walking around believing in Christianity, the trinity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were companions of Christians. And when they were freed, they had that belief in them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, they found Masjid Tucson. They walked there and they discovered the Quran. They discovered there is a miracle on the wall.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they have more capabilities to understand the code easier than us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, these are converted jinns. I mean, it&#39;s really very clear. [72:1] Say, &quot;I was inspired that a group of jinns listened, then said, &#39;We have heard a wonderful Quran.*</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We are a generation that when we were born, the Quran was in existence.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">During the Prophet Muhammad&#39;s time, people were born and there was no Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[72:2] &quot;&#39;It guides to righteousness, and we have believed in it; ....

Now, notice the things that we say here in this mosque and they repeat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Like in verse 13, this is something we always say at this mosque and they believe it now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are simply repeating what we say here.

The Lord Jesus will save us. He died for our sins.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Same things that you go through.

Do you think they are bad human beings?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ok, so if you talk about the human race, if you talk about the human race, you can say &quot;some of us are righteous and some are less than righteous.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&#39;re talking about the jinn race.

Or you&#39;re totally submitting to them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Your jinn is Satan&#39;s representative in your body, Satan&#39;s representative.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, she is continuously telling you not to worship God alone, to worship (unintelligible), and so on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is what she&#39;s doing, to stop you from the five Prayers, to discourage you from fasting in the month of Ramadan,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to tell you to follow the social system, have a boyfriend or a girlfriend,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">like they do in this country and so on. She is always telling you to do the bad things. Now, you are supposed to represent God&#39;s point of view, worship God alone, develop the soul, grow,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">do the five Prayers, fast the month of Ramadan, follow the moral system that God dictates,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is continuous debate in your head between you and your Satan representative.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, when this body dies, then both souls are freed, and we go to the world of souls and the jinn stays around for a few hundred more years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So this, the word &quot;jinn&quot; implies they are free companions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: Is the number of the humans equal to the number of jinns who are virgins that get assigned to humans?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Yes, the number of human and number of jinns are equal, but not at this time on Earth. There are jinns from the past generations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">roughly yes, roughly equal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Ranks in Heaven.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, no, no, not necessarily.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, higher than some angels. Yes. The angels will be distributed in the Heaven at all levels,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">just like...see, when we go back, we need to go back, rejoin God&#39;s Kingdom in the way we were before, before the feud happened, before the great feud.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But we can exceed where we were, depending on how much we develop our soul.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">See, we were in Heaven, and we were in a different rank. I mean, in a particular specific rank.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then we committed that crime, so we fell here. Now, our job is to redeem ourselves.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we can redeem ourselves to the same rank, or to higher, or lower, depending on how hard we work, or how much we develop our soul.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, when we go back, we&#39;re gonna fit back into God&#39;s Kingdom among the angels. We just go back to the same situation as before the feud, only with a new rank, depending on what we did.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Does that clarify this? So, some of the angels will be lower than us, if we develop ourselves sufficiently.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you develop yourself to the max, you can be at the highest level, with the highest angels, archangels.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, it&#39;s possible to be in a different stage, but this will affect the weakness of the human.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apamea: Dr. Khalifa, what is this in the first Aya, it is &quot;I was inspired?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: See, the &quot;say&quot; is to a messenger.

As long as 10 years ago, when we read this Sura, I said that the jinns come in here and they listen to us and they make this connection.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Also, during the time of Prophet Muhammad, Muhammad has been addressed that say &quot;I was inspired.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Because Prophet Muhammad is the first person that received these verses from God, but this now happens a second time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: And there are many prophecies here, but we cannot say that Prophet Muhammad has not been addressed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: We cannot say that he has either. Most probably, he was not, because there was no Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: But Quran, now we do Quranic study. If we recite a part of Quran, we can say this is Quran. For verses of Quran, we can say Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They didn&#39;t hear all the Quran, but part of the Quran, we can say Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(72:1) &#1587;&#1614;&#1605;&#1616;&#1593;&#1618;&#1606;&#1614;&#1575; &#1602;&#1615;&#1585;&#1618;&#1569;&#1614;&#1575;&#1606;&#1611;&#1575; &#1593;&#1614;&#1580;&#1614;&#1576;&#1611;&#1773;&#1575; or some verses from Quran. The messenger: Ok. (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s very possible. No, I didn&#39;t hear the whole question.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t hear the whole question.

Same stage as the Prophet and the people around him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes. No. Okay.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is demon possession. Some of them are mischievous.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes. This is a rare thing. Has anybody here seen a demon possessed person?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">See, it&#39;s rare. Only if you want to, see the movie &quot;Exorcist.&quot; It&#39;s a great exaggeration based on a true story.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ok. Back to Apamea. Only ten minutes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: No, this is, the place of worship is in the act of worship. When you do the prayer, or the fasting, or the Hajj must be devoted to God alone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the Khutba and in the Quranic study, in the Quran and so on, the Quran itself says &quot;mention in connection with the scripture, Abraham, Mary, Pharaoh.&quot; The Quran itself says that. So,...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, I would, since it is places of worship.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">See, if you read Sura 19, it tells you (19:16) &#1608;&#1614;&#1649;&#1584;&#1618;&#1603;&#1615;&#1585;&#1618; &#1601;&#1616;&#1609; &#1649;&#1604;&#1618;&#1603;&#1616;&#1578;&#1614;&#1600;&#1648;&#1576;&#1616; Mentioned in the book, or any connection with it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It mentions Mary, or Jesus, or Pharaoh, and so on, and Abraham, those names.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, when you study the Quran, or you&#39;re learning from history, you have to mention these names.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Only because God said so. But when it comes to the act of worship, you must devote it to God completely.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes. Edip: Rashad, you mean mentioning, there are difference between two mentioning.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: For example, when you praise God, you are praising God, b. t if you mention somebody else, he&#39;s mentioning his worship.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Allah avoid us this kind of mentioning.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: For example, in Islam, you praise God, and you call to God, and you add somebody&#39;s name,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for example, Muhammad or Ali&#39;s name, and also you are calling for prayer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Prayer is a connection with God, a contact with God. Edip: And here, in this situation, when you mention other names, this is a position of worship.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: It must be devoted to God alone, the act of worship. But here we are studying, like now, for example, we are studying the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Quran said, tells you to mention these names to learn from the history.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, mentioning it then in this context is okay. I see your point, Edip.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wanna make it as difficult as possible, because no matter what understanding or interpretation you may reach, you&#39;ll be taking a chance if you mention anybody else&#39;s name in the acts of worship.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Like, we do the prayer in the desert sometimes, a lot. Driving, we go in the desert, we go to the picnic area, and what this means in the picnic area, we should not mention Sharif or Mehdi?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: I do not see the motivation for you to avoid this issue. There are people that really call on you to be a follower of the Prophet.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: They always have the argument that you are not (unintelligible). So why do you refrain from doing this? Because it is a claim to avoid any possibility at all. It just seems to me like it is an enemy of the religion here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: But the key words here are place of worship, or position of worship.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, in the specific practices of worship, like Salat, and fasting, and Zakat, and Hajj,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and sacrificing animals, whatever, this must be devoted to God alone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When you mention the name of God when an animal, it must be the name of God alone, no other names.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I wanna go back to, when you do the prayer in the picnic area, when you stand up for the prayer, you mention only the name of God in the prayer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as you say Al-Salaamu &lsquo;Alaykum, you say &quot;congratulations, Douglas.&quot; So, you mention Douglas. But it is not part of the worship.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I want to make this very strict, but it goes without saying that when you are outside of the</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the acts of worship, you can... the Quran itself says &quot;mention those names to learn from their history.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">God teacher of the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay, but you see, Rami, you have a very good point here, but remember that the teacher of Quran is God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And for the sincere believers, God will see to it that they will reach the right conclusion, just like we are reaching it right now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m not... they don&#39;t need me. I&#39;m not the one who&#39;s teaching the Quran. God is teaching all of us right now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rami: But we are having some kind of contradiction...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Well listen, if God guides them to mention no other name in the mosque under any circumstances,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we may be able to build a mosque right here in this area where there is a prayer hall where there is no other name is mentioned.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And our Quranic study will be in a place where we have chairs and a movie screen or a big TV or something.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That will be for the Quranic study. And when we go to the prayer hall, no other name will be mentioned in that hall.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If they do that, more power to them. They&#39;ll be wonderful. We may be able to do this some day, do it some day. But this is where the word compromisers comes in the picture.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As you see, it&#39;s only four verses before that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the message reaches, no. Remember that God is the teacher of the Quran to every generation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And for the sincere believers, God sees to it that they reach the correct conclusions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The insincere will always be sent astray, no matter how clear you can be.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is a law in verse 18 that we can never compromise it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, remember there is a law in the Quran that says if you are forced by circumstance</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">without being malicious or deliberate, you are committing no errors. So right now, our circumstances dictate on us that we use this same hall for prayer and for Quranic study and for potlucks and so on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the day will come when we&#39;re rich enough, IN SHAA ALLAH, we will have a complex</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on this block where there is a prayer hall. But nothing goes on in it except prayer and only the name of God.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Sermons &ldquo;khutba&rdquo; not part of the contact prayer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pardon? Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes. Yeah, but the Khutba follows the instructions of the Quran.

Why God is putting so much importance on it?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And giving the name of the title of the Sura from that incident, why?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s for us to learn.

I mean, Astaghfirullah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why is He telling us to dress up for the mosque?

Everything they did.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is why God put the children of Israel in the Quran.

(unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Men have to be modest, too. We&#39;re here at Quranic sitting, we&#39;re at Juma&#39;. And it&#39;s really hard when people are speaking,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and you look around and all you see is legs. You know, just bare legs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, you turn away, over here is another pair of bare legs. And you look over here and there&#39;s another pair of bare legs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the shorts are short and it&#39;s like... You know, women have the same feelings as men.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, you know, if we all came in shorts, nobody would be able to concentrate on anything. And this is such a similar time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I&#39;m just so glad to hear it finally brought up that modesty in men is just as important, you know, as it is for women.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laurie: And it&#39;s been, you know, very distracting. And sometimes it&#39;s really hard to concentrate because you can&#39;t see them. All you see is somewhere is legs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: And God addressed both the men and the women to subdue their eyes, both of them. So, God wants us to help each other in this way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Linda.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speak louder. Linda: Are you saying.... The messenger: I think the same thing that Laurie is saying. Oh.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right. They can be distracted as well. Linda: ....., Rashad. I really, really think, I think the first responsibility lies with each one of us, with our eyes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible) any kind of distraction. The messenger: Right. Linda: And that, I mean, the fact that we see that right, we need (unintelligible) in order to help each other. We need not to present situations. Especially, The messenger: Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Linda: within our community, it will hinder each other because we are brothers and sisters. We need to recognize our weaknesses and help each other not to be in situations where the devil can bring our weaknesses out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Um-hum. M&atilde; Sh&atilde; All&atilde;h Edip: Rashad, (unintelligible) the reason I want to (unintelligible) is because... The messenger: Yeah, go ahead.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: I (unintelligible)... that some people know and some people doesn&#39;t know (unintelligible) and some people The messenger: That&#39;s right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: I know they are (unintelligible) and they are brightened and</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">just really very disturbing. Edip: I just want to share with you this few pages. First of all, honestly I am a sincere believer. I know myself. I will say it. It&#39;s not ego.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Edip Yuksel complains and accuses Dr. Rashad Khalifa of flaws.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, if you are sincere, people around me can judge that we are sincere.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In Turkey, when I heard this message, thank God, from Rashad, God put me in the greatest.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I gave up everything that I had until that time. I gave up from my thousands of readers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I gave up from my job. I gave up from my family, from my father, mother, sisters, each friend.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I accepted when I first heard that Rashad says &quot;I&#39;m a messenger of God&quot;, I accepted without any doubt. I said &quot;yes, okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had no ego in this case. And now some people just want to accuse me that I have great ego and I am idol worship.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I worship my ego. It is very easy accusation. Oh, somebody who takes questions or discuss a subject if he doesn&#39;t understand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, you are egoistic. You are worshiping your ego.&quot; It is very easy. Edip: And for some people, they want to show that they are protector of the messenger. From whom? From believer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And backbite a believer and accuse a believer. At that time, show yourself,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you are protector of the messenger. You love messenger more than everybody. What kind of race is this?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is that righteous race? I want to share some verses from Quran.

GOD is Hearer, Omniscient.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[49:2] O you who believe, do not raise your voices above the voice of the prophet,... This is the Prophet Muhammad, and it is set as an example for us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[49:2] .... nor shall you shout at him as you shout at each other,.... Why is God saying this? Why? He tells us why.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[49:2].... lest your works become nullified while you do not perceive.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why will my work be nullified if I shout at the messenger? Or if I raise my opinion above the opinion of the messenger? How will my work be nullified?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I pray five times a day. I fast the month of Ramadan. I worship God alone.&quot; What God is telling me &quot;if you place your opinion above that of God and the messenger, your works are nullified.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What is the mechanism of nullifying my works by doing this?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Here&#39;s the mechanism. Because when I do this to the messenger, and there is an outsider who will come and see this,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">now the outsider comes and sees that one of the closest persons to the messenger is telling him</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;you don&#39;t believe in God&#39;s Omnipotence. You don&#39;t believe that this and that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the outsider will leave. Okay, and become a disbeliever, for example. If I do this and drive the outsider away, I will carry this person&#39;s sins.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is how my works will be nullified. Why is God saying this?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is God advocating idol worship, or what? Of course not. So, there is a reason for it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, see, you see now what the point is. Edip came to a certain conclusion, and he made an opinion, and he didn&#39;t wanna give it up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He still doesn&#39;t want to give it up. Edip: I just....Rashad, this is correct, this is wrong. This is...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Whatever people you ask, if some person, if any being... The messenger: Okay, you&#39;re still on number one. So, let me go to number one.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip says that I say that God is not Omnipotent. The messenger: Of course, I never said that. Edip: No, no, the second one.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: The second one contradicts God. The messenger: I said that God cannot turn Sodom upside down without the angels. The messenger: Is this what you are saying?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Excuse me? Edip: If God was, He is Omnipotent, He can do without angels. The messenger: without angels.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Okay, then let us look at this. Let&#39;s see what God says, and we cannot be more godly than God. I&#39;m going to use an example that is identical.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this, God says that the creation of Jesus is like the creation of Adam, equal to the creation of Adam. We&#39;re all familiar with this verse.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then God goes on in the verse and says &quot;I said to him, be, and he was.&quot; So, this is how God gets things done. God can get anything done, by saying &quot;be&quot;, and it is, right?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet, we look at the Quran consistently about the creation of Adam. We see that God says &quot;I blew into Adam from My spirit.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because that was up there in the first heaven. Adam was up there. God was up there. And God blew into Adam from His spirit.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, the identical creation of Jesus, God said to Jesus, &quot;be&quot;, and he was.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God said &quot;be&quot; and he was. But God tells us in the Quran, He sent the angel to Mary, carrying this command &quot;to be.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And God speaks in the plural. The messenger: He said &quot;we blew into Mary from our spirit.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: There&#39;s a question, Rashad. Does He... The messenger: So, therefore, therefore, God is teaching us that there is a system of be, and it is.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God didn&#39;t just sit up there in the first universe, He said &quot;be&quot;, and Jesus was.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The mechanism was that the angel Gabriel came down to the planet earth, which cannot stand the physical presence of God, and Gabriel carried that command.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And &quot;we blew into her from our spirit.&quot; So, this is the difference. God tells us about the system. Now, I cannot say that God said, be, to Jesus, and Jesus was, without the intervention of the angel.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I cannot say that, because it will be a lie. Satan, when Satan failed to stop you from worshipping God, he will push you to the other extreme.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He will make you demand of God more than what God Himself said.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is the situation that we have here. In other words, God said He sent the angel to create Jesus, and then we say &quot;God doesn&#39;t need the angel.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, who am I to decide that? God Himself told us that He sent the angel with the command. These are two identical things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you can... God also said He sent the angels to turn Sodom upside down.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I cannot say otherwise. I have to abide by what God said.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If God said He sent the angels to turn it upside down, I can&#39;t say that God can sit up there and say &quot;be&quot;, and it is upside down.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God is teaching us that there is a system, there is a mechanism. But the point that Behrouz is talking about is nullifying our works.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Nullifying our works&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it brings out this very serious idol worship that is idolizing our opinion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We must give up our opinion in favor of God&#39;s opinion. God said He sent the angel to blow into Mary from God&#39;s spirit, through the mediation of the angel, we have to believe that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Rashad, did I say, please, did I say &quot;God didn&#39;t send angels?&quot; Did I say &quot;God doesn&#39;t use angels?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I only say &quot;God uses angels, but this doesn&#39;t mean God needs angels.&quot; God has obligation, needs them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: God doesn&#39;t need anybody. But God.... may God select the angels. The messenger: What did you say now?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: I think maybe it&#39;s the difference between the words, God wants to use the angels, and maybe God won&#39;t control without angels, but it&#39;s not that God cannot.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: Do you know what I mean? God can do everything, but God has chosen His system, and He will use them. The messenger: We have a linguist here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: What is the difference between &quot;want&quot; and &quot;need&quot;, Martha?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: No, I want you to answer this first, then go on. Edip: God wanted this, or God needed this. Martha: I think we don&#39;t need a linguist to answer that question.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: OK. Tell us what you think. Martha: Can I just back up? The messenger: No, just tell us the difference between &quot;need&quot; and &quot;want&quot;, first.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Martha: Need implies a certain dependency on something else.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Martha: Want is something that you have a decision about meaning you&#39;re choosing to do one thing as opposed to another.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Okay, what&#39;s the question? A woman: I wasn&#39;t here for the original thing, right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: I just have this fear that what&#39;s happening is the devil is just kind of getting in between us here based on just a real, maybe a misunderstanding. The messenger: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: Are you saying that Rashad said, number one, two, and the ones that are in black there?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: The black is what Rashad said. A woman: Ok. Wait a second, wait a second.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: Rashad, did you say those things? The messenger: No. A woman: It&#39;s the end. Edip: You didn&#39;t say that God cannot control without angels, cannot do this without angels, Rashad, that day. Lisa, he didn&#39;t say this?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: He didn&#39;t say this? Thank God. You forgot. Alhamdu Lillah. Edip: I will foget. The messenger: No, we didn&#39;t forget.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: You&#39;re the only one that said that. The messenger: Ahmad? Ahmad: There is another Aya in the Quran that says that God wants all the big people to believe, He can do it. Right?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ahmad: So, there is a difference between me and God. Edip: Sure. M&atilde; Sh&atilde; All&atilde;h. Ahmad: So, He can want, He can do all of these things without angels, but His system specifies angels to do this. Edip: Sure.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ahmad: And to do that, and to do that. The messenger: That&#39;s exactly what we were saying. That&#39;s what I said.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: I think the whole problem with everything that&#39;s being said is that everybody in this room believes number one. Everybody does.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We don&#39;t believe number two. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. So then, verbs like we use, can, or need, or has to, they don&#39;t apply.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can&#39;t say, like Rashad said,....</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">....God in a different way, or can do things, or needs to do things. These are verbs that don&#39;t apply to God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: I don&#39;t think any of this.... Edip: Okay. Edip: This was the discussion, this was the discussion, and many times has been used word can. You can&#39;t call...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Alhamdu Lillah. A woman: No, but we&#39;re all worried, right? The messenger: Right. You hit the nail on the head</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apamea: Okay. And there are many people here that cannot speak it. And his people, does he believe, are his brothers, turn against him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Dr. Rashad Khalifa says &ldquo;Edip Yuksel has a serious problem and we are trying to help him&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: Nobody is turning against him.

Edip: Okay, Rashad, what is the...

He has a real, he has a severe, has a very severer problem that may destroy... Edip: Rashad, why don&#39;t you... in the last question... my last question. I shouted at you, Rashad, please. Apamea: He needed to know that he heard you right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Behrouz: Now, the one thing happened. Wait, wait.

He understood it, and he repented. He said &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Edip: No, you all didn&#39;t accept... in fact, you cannot use Behrouz: Come on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: &quot;God cannot do this.&quot; Behrouz: He, at latest, he said &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; Edip: Oh, he did not... he actually shouted at messenger. Behrouz: Well, his English is perfect.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: He shouts at everybody. Ok, the man is...

You worried about me because I shouted at you because I may misunderstand, I may understand according to Quran, I see....</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: No, I worry about you because you worship your opinion to the point of destroying you.

The messenger: Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Sabahi: And he say that he didn&#39;t say so. Edip: Alhamdu Lillah, Dr. Sabahi: Listen, listen, you say that and then again you get... It&#39;s not fun but I may... The messenger: Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Sabahi: You have to seriously, all of us, have to seriously think about this and analyze the situation. The messenger: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Sabahi: And if you really, really deep down believe that God is the Omnipotent, then He&#39;s gonna take care of it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If somebody is doing something wrong, if somebody has wrong beliefs, He&#39;s gonna be exposed The messenger: Exactly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Sabahi: if people think that God is capable of it. So, we don&#39;t have to take it in our hands. So, let it drop.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can, you know, cool down, get to your work, and let&#39;s, you know, you can discuss the issue, discuss it, find the problem.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But you cannot find the guilt if this is not the cause. The messenger: Exactly. Dr. Sabahi: You cannot find someone. Let God take care of it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If things are clear, the things that you were worried about, that God is not Omnipotent, I can&#39;t see what you think.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: M&atilde; Sh&atilde; All&atilde;h. Dr. Sabahi: So, I was surprised that you brought that up. From what I understand this is not the case, here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These are....Sometimes you may hear something, I wait, and then say &quot;oh, I made a mistake.&quot; You hear it, or somebody made a mistake.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Let them correct themselves. But you are asking too much now. You want someone to come out and say &quot;I made this mistake. I&#39;m sorry. You are right.&quot; No, this is not gonna happen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Behrouz: And I have to I wanna... The messenger: M&atilde; Sh&atilde; All&atilde;h, I have to, I have to compliment you for... You found out exactly what the problem is.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you just, you put it really better than anyone can possibly put it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Were you talking? Behrouz: Excuse me. I want to tell Apamea that we all love Edip. And all over the world, they know Edip.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is knowledgeable. We appreciate it. And I appreciate it myself because I sit there, and he gives a lot of knowledge to me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ok? And believe me, I suggested to Mahmoud and Mohtasham from the day that happened, that let&#39;s, guys, sit... let&#39;s sit down and talk to him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But God is witness. That was not a day that we could get him by himself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You were here. We didn&#39;t wanna talk to him in front of you. And we all wanted to talk to him, three of us together.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because if someone talked to him, all the things he says, he says &quot;no.&quot; Whatever you say, he says &quot;no.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then it takes him two days and half &quot;I found out.&quot; That say &quot;okay, you&#39;re right.&quot; But us, me to him, I&#39;m just a stupid.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know nothing. Okay, now see, this is the impression everybody&#39;s getting. Everybody to him, everybody does not understand but him. Okay, thanks.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, we tried to help him. Three days in a row, we tried to get him in a corner.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey, this is it, brother.&quot; We are worried about you. &quot;Let&#39;s repent and forget about it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there were seven people witnessing that day. I&#39;m not taking sides. I&#39;m not politician.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If I was, I wouldn&#39;t be here. I would have a beautiful job. I would make a lot of money like the others are doing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m not the smart outside. I&#39;m just, my heart is very open.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You will find out later on. And I think this is the reason that I&#39;m here. This is the reason he&#39;s here. But when you get over here, you wanna say &quot;hey, I&#39;m this and that.&quot; You&#39;re gonna lose it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is what&#39;s gonna happen. It&#39;s going to happen. But we care about him. We don&#39;t want this to happen to him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I&#39;m sure as much as us, you worry about him more. And so as Naghmeh and other friends.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apamea: I&#39;m his wife, and I have never seen him opinionated with me. Behrouz: Because you&#39;re his wife. Right. Apamea: If anyone he&#39;s opinionated with, it&#39;s me. I would be the one all the time and he humbles me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Behrouz: Yes, that&#39;s the love. Behrouz: But the love between you and him.... Apamea: So, I can&#39;t comprehend the fact that he&#39;s being blamed for being opinionated.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apamea: Because he is so humble. Behrouz: To you it is. Apamea: And he is... Behrouz: If I was his wife, he would be humbling.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Edip is in deep trouble. Behrouz: This relationship is different. Behrouz: This is different. The messenger: OK. Behrouz: But to him and me and us sitting over here. We&#39;re not proving anything that &quot;I&#39;m smart, you&#39;re smart. No, I&#39;m God&#39;s....&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Behrouz: Well, unfortunately, this is the impression everybody is getting. The messenger: They cannot... it&#39;s Ok. Ok. Let me... The messenger: Let&#39;s see what God is saying. Let&#39;s see what God is saying.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wait a minute. Let&#39;s see what God is saying.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wanna reiterate what Behrouz said that we all love Edip. We&#39;re trying to step him out of it. He&#39;s in deep, deep trouble.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Satan, remember Satan believed in God. Satan knew God. But he was kicked out of God&#39;s kingdom because of ego.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;If you ever commit idol worship&rdquo; &ndash; Idolizing one&rsquo;s own opinion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We read on page 465, verse 65, Sura 39.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[39:65] It has been revealed to you,....

Stated very clearly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Idolize one&#39;s opinion means you hold fast to it. Just like Dr. Sabahi spotted it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And nothing will stand in the way of your opinion. You just hold fast.... This is idol worship.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everybody knows Edip is a believer. Everybody knows Edip is knowledgeable.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everybody knows he&#39;s sincere. But the danger he&#39;s in now is that he may fall into this, 65. He may nullify all his works.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have to remember that Satan believed in God. And out of love, all of us, we are trying to help him. In fact, they made a committee, Behrouz, Mohtasham and Mahmoud. And they wanted to talk to him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: To help him. Not to attack him. Edip: Rashad, what you didn&#39;t inquire...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Dr. Masoud is trying to talk for a long time. The messenger: Go ahead. Dr. Masoud: As a new believer, Alhamdu Lillah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of the side attractions of this place, I call it side attraction, Because the main attraction here for me is God&#39;s word, God&#39;s message.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The side attraction for me here was the closeness, Dr. Masoud: the family atmosphere that I saw with you. The messenger: Yes. Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Masoud: You know, being from Iran, being a Shia, Shia that they taught us,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I haven&#39;t seen anything like this. And this was very, very attractive for me. I brought all my family over here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But what I saw today in the Khutba, and what I saw today here, is completely different</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from what I have been thinking during these past two months of coming over here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You taught me that the Prophet is a human. I really never thought that the Prophet was human.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thought Prophet was walking with a halo, you know, over his head. You couldn&#39;t see his face. All these things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I came over here and I saw that the Prophet is somebody like me, and somebody like you. You can talk to him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can go and ask him questions. Dr. Masoud: But now you are just completely different people. And this is really, really disappointing. The messenger: This will never change. This will never change.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: What do you think Behrouz said, and what do you think should be done? Dr. Masoud: I cannot judge on that because I don&#39;t know really. I cannot be proactive in what happened over there. So I&#39;m not going...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m going to leave these two together. But we are going to go back to the community that Dr. Sabahi was in.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We are going to love each other. We are going to respect each other. And we are going to apologize to each other, every one of us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For what happened over here today and what we are teaching to our children. The messenger: This is exactly what Behrouz was calling for. He doesn&#39;t want... He wants to follow what God is saying</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to ensure that we are a family. Because God said the believers are a family. The messenger: Douglas.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Douglas: In Sura 39, verse 18, God says [39:18] They are the ones who examine all words, then follow the best. These are the ones whom GOD has guided; these are the ones who possess intelligence.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I think that one of the things that Satan&#39;s doing here is that he is making people feel that their words are better than someone else&#39;s.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What we are supposed to do is that whenever we discuss anything or follow the messenger of God or what have you, the ultimate is always God&#39;s words.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Another verse in the Quran is in Sura 58, verse 10. It says, [58:10] Secret conspiracy is the devil&#39;s idea, through which he seeks to hurt those who believed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He seeks to hurt those who believe. [58:10] ..... However, he cannot hurt them against GOD&#39;s will. In GOD the believers shall trust.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I think we all should remember that God says in the Quran that He&#39;s aware of the innermost thoughts.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And He will cause to come forth in us all of our weaknesses.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That He will bring out our weaknesses according to His will and that when these weaknesses come out,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">if we are really sincere and we worship God alone, we will pray to Allah to face them in ourselves and we will follow what is best.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We will follow and examine the words and follow what is best and we will not try to defend our own weaknesses and our own opinions and our own words.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because I think all of us do and God knows this. This is an extremely critical time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not just this situation, but in a very short time and I think all of us feel this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The miracle in the Quran, the awareness that Rashad is the Messenger of the Covenant is going to spread like wildfire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is going to spread like wildfire. It&#39;s almost as if we are on the verge</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Douglas: of major events and so the family has to be prepared.

Satan doesn&#39;t like it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Douglas: When you know that people are coming to your house, what do you do? You run and pick up the trash and straighten up and try to make it look good.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have to be prepared for what is about to take place.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: Alhamdu Lillah. Let us now turn to God and ask him. God never turns us down.

[2:275] Those who take usury are in the same position as those who are controlled by the devil. This is because they claim that usury is the same as trade. GOD has made trade lawful, and has made usury unlawful. Whoever heeds this commandment from his Lord, and refrains from usury, he may keep his past earnings, and his judgment rests with GOD. As for those who persist, they incur Hell, they abide therein forever.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is exactly what God is telling us here.

And some people, because of the economic situation, could very much take advantage of that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And hurt others. And God teaches us that that is evil.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the people who commit this wicked act, their place is in the hellfire and they are disbelievers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And definitely this is given to us many times from God and the messenger confirms it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we should attain certainty about it and have... so that we can have mercy from God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Do you have any comments?

If you go many, many years before that, Satan thought he can be a god beside God, and this</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">0:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">created the different opinions among God&#39;s creatures in God&#39;s kingdom, where the vast majority upheld God&#39;s absolute authority, and the tiny minority agreed with Satan to different degrees.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And after that, God decided to call Satan&#39;s bluff, and make him, give him a dominion and constituents.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those who agreed with him are to become his constituents, and the planet Earth is to become his dominion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the plan called for, in fact, this was after putting all those creatures to death.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then, this verse here has to do with telling the angels that they will serve the human beings</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on this earth. They drive the wind, guarantee the provisions, guard them, serve them,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">because they serve us. Angels serve us, even though we are the rebels, and they are the ones who upheld God&#39;s absolute authority, but they are participating in the plan that God is carrying out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is exactly why we were talking about this last night, where they beat up the disbelievers at the end.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because they served them with the hope that they will come back to God&#39;s kingdom.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They will redeem themselves. They will repent. They&#39;ll apologize for the mistake they committed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But then, when the life comes to an end, and the person is a disbeliever, then they beat him up, because</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they served him all this life, they provided him with all the means to redeem himself,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">but then at the end he died as an unappreciative of God. So, we understand all this by looking at this verse.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, &quot;what prevented you from prostrating&quot; means you are not cooperating, you are not participating</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in serving the human being.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This may indicate also that Satan did not want to guarantee the happiness and welfare of any human being.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He wanted to keep his options open, because he is supposed to act as a god,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">meaning, he is supposed to make everybody happy and wealthy and healthy and perfectly alright.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But he didn&#39;t want this guarantee. He wants to be free to punish whomever he wills, persecute whomever he wills, and help</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">whomever he wills. So, this is why he did not prostrate before the human being.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When God told him that he will be a temporary god, this meant that he was supposed to take care of his constituents and make them perfectly happy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, maybe he wanted some exit in case he cannot do it. &quot;oh, I&#39;m just persecuting god.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But of course, his failure is glaring now. Number 13, [7:13] God said, &quot;Therefore, you must go down, for you are not to be arrogant here. Get out; you are debased.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is a confirmation of his dismissal from God&#39;s kingdom. Number 14,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[7:14] Satan said, &quot;Grant me a respite, until the Day of Resurrection.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[7:15] God said, &quot;You are granted a respite.&quot; [7:16] He said, &quot;Since You have willed that I go astray,* I will skulk for them on Your straight path.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this verse 16, Satan acknowledges that everything happens in accordance with God&#39;s will.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it is God&#39;s will that we will, that we have a free choice. God willed that we will.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that all His creatures will, because this rebellion indicates that God&#39;s creatures have freedom of choice.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, the very first verse we read indicates that God&#39;s creatures can say &quot;no.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God said &quot;fall prostrate,&quot; and Satan said &quot;no, I will not.&quot; So, it indicates, if this did not happen, we would never know that God&#39;s creatures have freedom of choice.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, Satan said, in number 16 here, [7:16] .....&quot;Since You have willed that I go astray,* I will skulk for them on Your straight path.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[7:17] &quot;I will come to them from their front, from their back, from their right, and from their left, and You will find that most of them are unappreciative.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay, 17, 7:17, remember this verse, because you will see it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We experienced it, and we see it all around us, that Satan comes to the human being from</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">his front, back, right, and left, and never runs out of tricks to divert us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This place right here is his number one target. Because people come here, and what do they come here for?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They come here to worship God alone, uphold the word of God alone. This is exactly what Satan does not want.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he will put up all kinds of obstacles, and all kinds of tests, persecutions, in many, many different and strange ways.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is good, because this guarantees that all God&#39;s people are solid believers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Satan wants to show &ldquo;some humans are worse than Satan&rdquo; example how people argue about Quranic letter counts.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&#39;re unshakable, no matter what happens, or who says what.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[7:17] &quot;I will come to them from their front, and from their back, and from their right, and from their left, and You will find that most of them are unappreciative.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think one of Satan&#39;s objectives is to show God that some humans are worse than he is, than Satan.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it&#39;s true. Some humans out-satan Satan.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Satan is hoping that God may have mercy on him when He sees that some creatures are worse than he is.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I recall this fellow, when I was talking in Los Angeles, and this</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">professor at Chicago Seminary came out and gave a talk that the Quran is hallucinations by Muhammad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And immediately after him, I gave a talk that the Quran could not be the word of human being. It has to be</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the word of God, and here is the physical evidence. And I gave some details of the miracle, including the total of the numbers in the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When you take all the numbers mentioned in the Quran and add them up, the total is divisible by 19. So, these people from the American Islamic College in Chicago, also the same city,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they stood up and instead of attacking Dr. Hamilton, they attacked Rashad Khalifa. They attacked me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The guy who said &quot;the Quran is hallucinations by Muhammad&quot; is okay. But the person who stood up to say &quot;the Quran is the word of God,&quot; they attacked me and they said</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;you didn&#39;t count the Shadda (geminate), Arrahman. There is a Shadda on the RA. You must count two RAs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Muhammad (&#1605;&#1581;&#1605;&#1583;) is five letters.&quot; Well, he had written before that, that Muhammad is five letters.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I think his objective was because in the appendix 2 or I had published that if you add Ibrahim, Muhammad, and Rashad, the values of this and that, so they want to mess this up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he wants Muhammad (&#1605;&#1581;&#1605;&#1583;) to be written Muhamamad (&#1605;&#1581;&#1605;&#1605;&#1583;). You know, two Ms. So, when he stood up and mentioned his name, I said &quot;oh, you&#39;re the fellow who thinks Muhammad should be five letters.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And even the Americans laughed, who are not Arabic speaking people. He said &quot;yes, if you put five coins on top of each other and you look at them, how many do you see?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger: I said &quot;it depends on the angle.&quot; A man: It was very quiet, just hundreds. The messenger: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: By the way, the sequence of talk was just, I mean, Dr. Hamilton was talking before Dr. Khalifa and nobody knew,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, everyone was gonna talk about. He went and talked about</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Quranic hallucinations of Muhammad, exactly before Rashad talked, and then Rashad went</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">immediately after him. I mean, who put that order? Dr. Khalifa: Who planned it this way? A man: And how many people were talking, that was three days seminar or something. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: It was three days and they put people at random. You know, they didn&#39;t organize it. It was not the chairman who organized it, they didn&#39;t even know who he was.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, they thought the, they thought the chairman of the session was me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were about to kill him, you know. Atif was there and Ihsan was there. A man: So, he finished all his games and just he was expecting everybody to be angry and mad and he gets Rashad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he throws his last coin and said &quot;oh, aren&#39;t you the one who&#39;s saying you are a messenger?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he got up while everybody&#39;s sitting there, then he goes and said &quot;repeat.&quot; &quot;You gotta give me one&quot;, you know. And he said &quot;yes.&quot; He did it. And you know, I think the guy was just,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you know, not getting for what he did. &quot;Oh, he was the one who&#39;s saying he&#39;s a messenger of God.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, I was just listening, and I&#39;m sure the guy was shocked. He was expecting a revolution, a coup, and all that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think he finished all his arguments and no response from the audience, he said &quot;oh, you&#39;re the one who&#39;s saying you are a messenger.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: You&#39;re right. A man: He was looking for that. He was trying to get his point... Ihsan: But then he ran away, you remember, when he didn&#39;t see anything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: He rushed out so fast, Ihsan thought he was going to get a gun or something and she got worried, and I said &quot;don&#39;t worry, Ihsan. I think the angels gave him a diarrhea or something.&quot; Because he rushed so fast.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ihsan: I will never saw him, again. Dr. Khalifa: He rushed so fast, he had a blind man with him. of course they&#39;re all blind, but this one, also his eyes are blind, not just his heart.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he was helping this blind man. He left his blind friend and ran, and never saw him again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Rasool. A man: Some of the audience was very (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Because every time (unintelligible) Rashad, (unintelligible) he did</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you look in the Quran, you count Qaf, for example, two halves are in the Quran (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, you count them, let&#39;s say, 59. Khalifa counted 57,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You see in this way, let&#39;s say you&#39;re right. But he&#39;s also right. Now, Rashad Khalifa&#39;s 57 has a miracle with it. He counts 59, he has no miracle with it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, if you go really fair, if you count it Rashad&#39;s way, it&#39;s 57, if you wanna count it your way, you can count it your way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: It doesn&#39;t come out... Dr. Khalifa: You have nothing. A man: There is no Qaf there to count. A man: I feel it was so fair, at least one of them found it. Dr. Khalifa: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Don&#39;t be upset, he counted that he was right, it was 57. And you wanna count it, he counted 59, but it...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, he said &quot;if you consider there are two methods of counting. One of them is what your eyes see, which is what Khalifa is suggesting.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And one is your way. If you wanna count the Shaddas as 2, fine. Go ahead and do it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Because some... he looked Pakistani or Afghani or something, one of the professors.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ihsan: I think he was Iranian. Dr. Khalifa: Could be. Ihsan: His accent was Iranian, he looked Iranian. Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, Anyway, so he said... it&#39;s like having two boxes, one is full of jewels, one is full of garbage. Open the one you like.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You open this box, there&#39;s lots of jewels. You open this one, there&#39;s a lot of garbage in here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: (89:14) &#1573;&#1616;&#1606;&#1614;&#1617; &#1585;&#1614;&#1576;&#1614;&#1617;&#1603;&#1614; &#1604;&#1614;&#1576;&#1616;&#1649;&#1604;&#1618;&#1605;&#1616;&#1585;&#1618;&#1589;&#1614;&#1575;&#1583;&#1616; Dr. Khalifa: So, this fellow is worse than Satan. He would out-Satan Satan. That&#39;s for sure.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, what are we trying to say? We&#39;re trying to say &quot;the Quran is from God, and here is physical evidence.&quot; What is he trying to do? He&#39;s trying to destroy it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, I mentioned the numbers specifically, because it has nothing to do with spelling. A man: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, no, Edip&#39;s discovery of the Al-F&atilde;tehah has nothing to do with spelling or writing. It was nothing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because sometimes they say &quot;oh, the Quran is oral.&quot; Well, it&#39;s right there, written.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of their big things, I&#39;m sure you heard that, they say &quot;the Quran is oral.&quot; Have you heard that argument? A man: Yeah, &quot;It was memorized.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, transmitted orally. A man: Orally, and then later on... Dr. Khalifa: Right, so I asked him &quot;what was the first word they were revealed in the Quran?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(96:1) &#1649;&#1602;&#1618;&#1585;&#1614;&#1571;&#1618; Read. What is it, read lips? Even now, if they read lips, it&#39;s 19 times when you read Al-F&atilde;tehah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, God is killing all the excuses. The first revelation... excuse me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: It could be all of us. You can count them. A man: (unintelligible) to count them right. Dr. Khalifa: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: But Edip&#39;s discovery is blown out. Dr. Khalifa: Right. A man: And I think it was probably because he was tampering because he was describing some (unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">one day, who will find more and more. Dr. Khalifa: The first revelation spoke about IQRA&#39; and the pen. A man: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: (96:4) &#1649;&#1604;&#1614;&#1617;&#1584;&#1616;&#1609; &#1593;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1617;&#1605;&#1614; &#1576;&#1616;&#1649;&#1604;&#1618;&#1602;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1605;&#1616; He taught by means of the pen. Dr. Khalifa: So, what do you do with the pen? A man: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible). They have... and the second revelation was entitled the pen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first revelation is &quot;read&quot;, and it had &quot;the pen&quot; in it. And the second revelation was the pen. Obviously, God knew they will say that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, they will do anything to destroy God&#39;s miracle. A man: They have a Hadith that says, &quot;read.&quot; &quot;I can&#39;t read.&quot; Dr. Khalifa: Right. Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ihsan: We found it in the Bible, by the way. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible) The Bible, the book of Isaiah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It said &quot;the angel came to the unlearned man&quot; or something, &quot;and told him, read.&quot; &quot;He said I cannot read.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Very strange. Dr. Khalifa: Very strange. A man: Book of Isaiah? Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Keikhusro found it. The Book of Isaiah. Ihsan: Yeah, I have a copy with that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: It&#39;s exactly the story they gave us in Hadith. They probably took it from there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Hadith&rsquo;s taken from Bible stories. Talk of out of body experience.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were many things taken from the Bible. Ihsan: Yes, in a book of Hadith about Heaven having...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Like the Hadith about Heaven having, what, an eye never seen, and the ear never heard, and never imagined by a human being.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Word for word, I saw it in the Bible. Ihsan: Then, God said &quot;okay, go and study, come back.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Go learn how to read and write, and come back. 18</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[7:18] God said, &quot;Get out therefrom, despised and defeated.

But we learn from this, 19, 7:19, that Heaven exists.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was created. Then, when God created the seven universes, and it still exists today, and the righteous go straight to it.

He&#39;s a liar. This is a lie.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is why those who are fighting us are lying right and left.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s God&#39;s law that they argue against the truth with falsehood.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, they&#39;re following their teacher, Satan.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is good. If you look at page 467, verse 5 says,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[40:5] Disbelieving before them were the people of Noah, and many parties after them.

Consequently, I punished them; how terrible was My retribution!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, they&#39;re just following the steps of their master, Satan.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[7:20] The devil whispered to them, in order to reveal their bodies, which were invisible to them.

Where were their bodies? They were down here on earth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were up in Heaven, and their bodies were here on earth. And this is something that happened to me personally, I&#39;m passing on this information to all of us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But apparently it happened often. It happened when the Prophet Muhammad was taken to receive the Quran,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was taken to a different place, which is even farther than Paradise, but he also visited Paradise.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We see this in Sura 53:17, 18.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">17 where he saw the tree that Adam and Eve ate from.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It happened to Ihsan. This definitely happened to you when you were fired from your work.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Do you know the story of Ihsan? A woman: No. Dr. Khalifa: She was working, she was talking to Aunt Margaret in Sweden on the telephone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And all of a sudden, people came in, they saw her incoherent.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, they took her to the hospital. They called her children. Both of them are doctors, and of course they&#39;re thinking in terms of this world, what was it, a stroke? Is it a heart attack? Is it....?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But she was like she&#39;s not here. She was walking. She walked with them, went to the hospital.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Meanwhile, she... what did you see? You saw a gathering of a lot of people, and a tall, huge figure that she understood to be Abraham.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is interesting because the only prophet who was identified to me was Abraham, also.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And when she came to, she was in the hospital, and she.... now take it from there. What did you see?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: What happened? Ihsan: I think it&#39;s a confirmation for us, because, no, because then when I told him that, then he told me about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were taking me now where there were all the prophets and (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ihsan: And Behrouz also saw the same big figure. Dr. Khalifa: But that&#39;s....</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: We always have confirmation, Alhamdu Lillah. This coming Friday, Behrouz will give the Khutbah, and he will tell us about confirmation of how the revelation comes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s another issue. But when you came, in the hospital, you opened your eyes and you were in the hospital. Then what was the first... your first question was what?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ihsan: I never told.... I was talking to them. I talked to my daughter, called her on the phone. I was in the....</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She told me that I told her.... Dr. Khalifa: No, you didn&#39;t call her on the phone. You gave the phone number to somebody and they called her. Ihsan: Yeah, but they called, they put put me on the phone. I (unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They couldn&#39;t even write anything, sign anything. They have no idea what I was in there at all.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My body was there. I was talking, but at the same time I was somewhere else like, My soul was somewhere else.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I saw a gathering of all, it seems like they are all prophets and messengers, I think.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I could see their faces. They were taking someone that was huge, and very tall, and very proportionate, like the statue of liberty, or maybe more.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they were all saying five words, almost the same, clothes, and poems, or fashion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone, I mean, always, and he was back, but I knew that he was talking to them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: But they were not prophets, Ihsan. You said they were just people, millions of them. Ihsan: Yeah. A lot of people, but he was the one speaking. I think now that maybe they are.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: There aren&#39;t, there aren&#39;t that many messengers. Ihsan: They were like a square, (unintelligible). And the guy came, and he was talking to them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I was, and to me at the same time, I was talking to (unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t see my parents, but I was... yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: What was the first question when you came to in the hospital? I just wanna say what, how the bodies on earth feeling.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ihsan: (unintelligible) Ihsan: (unintelligible) &quot;You killed us&quot; &quot;you&#39;re killing me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: He scared us to death. Ihsan: They were all crying. I have...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I don&#39;t know. Why am I...? What is this? Who&#39;s sick?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He said &quot;there&#39;s one in hospital, there&quot; Dr. Khalifa: &quot;Why am I in the hospital?&quot; Ihsan: Yeah, I don&#39;t know what it was.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were two things happened at the same time, something with me and something on the earth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: So, you were talking to Anne Margaret on the telephone. Ihsan: Yeah. Dr. Khalifa: Next thing you know, you&#39;re in the hospital. Ihsan: Yeah. So, you told them &quot;what is going on? Why am I in the hospital? What&#39;s happening?&quot; What did they say?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ihsan: They said that I was... that &quot;they were called and they talked to them&quot; they said. And they put me in the car and took me to the hospital.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean &quot;what&#39;s happened? what&#39;s happened? (unintelligible)&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I said .... I told something to my son but he was not quite awake yet.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Did you get scared? Did you get scared? Ihsan: Yeah. Ihsan: I didn&#39;t know what was going on. I had to call everybody and tell them &quot;I&#39;m not...What did they tell you the last thing?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She said &quot;I have to go. I have to go.&quot; I have to go enjoy, but I had already prayed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible) I said &quot;I didn&#39;t have to....&quot; (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We were talking to three people. She said &quot;we were crying, crying, crying, crying and you said &quot;I have to go.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Ok. There was some example of having good formation of having the body here and the soul somewhere else, wherever that is.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: So, when the God asked the Satan to prostrate, He&#39;s basically saying &quot;prostrate with just the body, not the soul.&quot; Dr. Khalifa: Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: This is the idea of prostrating to the human being. (Unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Well, the plan was clear to everybody and so.... because from this, the information that God gave us, everybody knew what the plan was.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: And what was the plan? Dr. Khalifa: That all the rebels are put to death and will be brought to this world and the angels will serve them</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and guard them and then after the test is over, everybody will be either redeemed to God&#39;s kingdom or sent to Hell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: If it was the plan, Satan was also part of the plan and then as he said &quot;God willed him to be like this&quot;, so he&#39;s really innocent.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: He&#39;s what? A man: He&#39;s really innocent. God willed him.... Dr. Khalifa: Yes, he&#39;s trying to blame it on God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: But God gave him the freedom to choose. Because everything ultimately is in accordance with God&#39;s will.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, he&#39;s telling God &quot;You could have made me obedient.&quot; God doesn&#39;t want robots.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it&#39;s not up to Satan to decide that. And we know the law that God does not inflict an atom&#39;s worth of injustice.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, as God is revealing more and more of His information and we&#39;re understanding the total picture</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">more and more, but what in 20, &quot;the devil whispered to them in order to reveal their bodies&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">because their bodies were down on earth and he wanted them to get out, get evicted from Heaven and go down to their bodies which actually happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Debate on location of Adam and Eve&rsquo;s body.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The minute they broke God&#39;s law, they were sucked into their bodies down here on earth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Also at the beginning of the plan, since Adam and Eve didn&#39;t do anything wrong under the new circumstances,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they deserved to be in Heaven until they committed disobedience.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, they listened to Satan. Therefore, they belonged in his kingdom which was prepared down on earth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As long as they listened to God, they were in Heaven. The minute they listened to Satan and ate from the tree, they went down to Satan&#39;s kingdom.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Also, their bodies (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: That&#39;s a good point.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: That&#39;s a good point. Let&#39;s see, [7:21] He swore to them, &quot;I am giving you good advice.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">which is a lie. [7:22] He thus duped them with lies. As soon as they tasted the tree, their bodies became visible to them, and they tried to cover themselves with the leaves of Paradise....</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: No, of course, there were gardens here on earth as well, but we have to,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we have to look at this (7:22) &#1608;&#1614;&#1585;&#1614;&#1602;&#1616; &#1649;&#1604;&#1618;&#1580;&#1614;&#1606;&#1614;&#1617;&#1577;&#1616; the expression in Arabic is &#1649;&#1604;&#1618;&#1580;&#1614;&#1606;&#1614;&#1617;&#1577;&#1616; which is the same expression where they were.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah, maybe their bodies were up there in Heaven not down on earth. Ihsan: But also &#1580;&#1614;&#1606;&#1614;&#1617;&#1577;&#1616; was mentioned for garden.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: No, but see, the word that&#39;s the same word that is used. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#1649;&#1604;&#1618;&#1580;&#1614;&#1606;&#1614;&#1617;&#1577;&#1616; The Jannah, the Paradise.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Also,... (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Go down there from. Just that the way I have it in the movie script that I wrote that God sent the angels to bring a couple hundred pounds of</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of mud from the planet earth and took it up there. And who was asking about falling prostrate before the body, (unintelligible)?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this had to be up there. A man: Yes, the body must be up there because after this, God says &quot;go down on the earth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: This, Ihsan just said in Arabic, yeah. So,... A man: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: But no, actually, (unintelligible). A woman: If the prostration happened in the Heaven, then they can go down.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Then, we shouldn&#39;t put physical limitations on the body going up there or coming down here. If God wants to</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">move the bodies from the earth to Heaven, He&#39;ll do that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, we have to just keep this, reconsider this the position of the bodies whether they are down here on earth or up there in Heaven.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But this is a good point, Asif, that covering their bodies with the leaves of Paradise.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Would the Arabic word for body have a different meaning or is it very specific?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: No, it&#39;s very specific here. This word is used in a few places like when Adam&#39;s sons, one killed the other one, they said &quot;bury the body.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s the same word. A man: They mistranslated this one. Dr. Khalifa: &#1587;&#1614;&#1608;&#1618;&#1569;&#1614;&#1648;&#1578;&#1740; Dr. Khalifa: Hmm? A man: Other Tafsirs translated this..., other Tafsirs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: What did they say? A man: They said here (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Oh.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Okay, in 24 it says &quot;go down as enemies of one another.&quot; It says &quot;go down.&quot; So,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">obviously this is after the... after they saw their bodies.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is shaping up as having the bodies up there. Then, maybe my movie script is correct.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: IN SHAA ALLAH.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: No, it&#39;s good.

Dr. Khalifa: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: No, but the body was invisible to them. Their bodies were invisible meaning they were in a different dimension.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s like we don&#39;t see the angels or the jinns now who are right here with us.

A man: I was reading in the book a few years ago and this reminds me in that book,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it was going to explain how our physical body in this three dimensional world is actually that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">quality or the lowly part of all qualities when we are saying, when we are attached with this</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">three dimensional world like a person in the ocean that he wants to swim and talk and have some oxygen,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean like a person that is like a big (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now we&#39;re saying that we were in Paradise and we were like a soul.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And as soon as we disobey God&#39;s law and we eat from that tree, right there, as a punishment of that work</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: That&#39;s a good simulation. A man: Their body was</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: ...exposed, our body, as if it was something that made trouble for us and as a punishment appeared with us and</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we became a physical being instead of a soul.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Well, I think let&#39;s, just for the, it will be, I think, sufficient for us. Maybe, this is what God wants us to know at this time is that they were out of their bodies.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their bodies weren&#39;t visible to them. They were in Heaven. Everything was perfect.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The minute they broke God&#39;s law, they were back into their bodies. Then, their bodies became visible just like as we are now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But before this happens, until they broke God&#39;s law, they were free, they were in Heaven. Because the body is not anything really, so...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">like when the righteous go to Heaven, what happens? They leave their bodies and they go to Heaven. And Heaven is fantastic. They&#39;re having a lot of fun.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is the way Adam and Eve were. When they broke God&#39;s law, they were trapped into their bodies.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then their bodies became visible to them. Now, what we were not sure about was where exactly were their bodies</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that were not visible to them. We didn&#39;t pay attention to that. Edip: Rashad, this Paradise, Heaven may be changed to earth at that time because...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: No, no, no, there&#39;s no possibility of that because people go to Heaven now. So, where do they go?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: There are many Paradises now. Dr. Khalifa: No, it&#39;s Al-Jannah. It was one Jannah that Adam and Eve went to.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: There&#39;s no Jannah on earth. I can tell you that. Edip: There&#39;s one another question that always I wonder.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What is the answer to this? What is the existence of Adam? The existence of Adam starts from creation of</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible) or before that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God doesn&#39;t mention the first creation before Adam.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Because our first understanding is that... Dr. Khalifa: 172 in this same Sura</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[7:172] ....They all said, &quot;Yes. We bear witness.&quot; Thus, you cannot say on the Day of Resurrection, &quot;We were not aware of this.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When did this happen?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, Edip. When did this happen? 172.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: It&#39;s not the creation of Adam. Dr. Khalifa: No, it couldn&#39;t be.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">See, at the creation of the body of Adam, the clay body of Adam, all the humans were dead. They were already put to death as we see in Sura 67.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Explains why God created death and the REAL LOCATION of the body &ndash; the issue is settled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ok. We have, we have to put the pieces together. Now, Let&#39;s look at 67, page 562 verse 2.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[67:2] The One who created death and life for the purpose of distinguishing those among you who would do better.*</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, God created death. Now, the way I see it now, understand it now, is</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">when we rebelled against God, God put us all to death, the first death, remember?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Two deaths for the unrighteous, one death for the righteous. We were all put to death with the stipulation that we&#39;ll be brought into this life at the specified time</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and given the chance to redeem ourselves. So, when you go back here to 172, God says He summoned all the human race before Him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Obviously, they were not dead yet. And He told them &quot;am I not your Lord? And we all bore witness that He is our Lord.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, these are some of the things that happened before the creation of Adam&#39;s body.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Adam was included in this 172. He was just one of the human beings.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So after this was done, and the natural instinct of worshipping God alone was put in us, we were all put to death,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and then the plan, the execution of the plan started. God created the body of Adam from clay, told the angels &quot;fall prostrate before this body. You&#39;re gonna serve.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then, God assigned one of the humans, who happens to be Adam, to this body.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, Eve was assigned to the clone. God cloned a body from Adam&#39;s body,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and assigned the second human being, Eve, to that body, and then told them... you know the rest of the story.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: There&#39;s a word that&#39;s confused, Rashad. There&#39;s a word &quot;creation.&quot; &quot;Creation&quot;, I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: No, I said &quot;create the body.&quot; Edip: Right. Yes. Edip: But when we translate in Turkish, &quot;creation&quot; means just from nothing, just create. The creation of Adam starts from this... Dr. Khalifa: Right. Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: No, remember the body, create the body of Adam. But before the creation of the body of Adam, Adam existed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: I think it&#39;s not a form of Adam, because KHALAQA... Dr. Khalifa: No, the creation of body, the creation of Adam&#39;s body, yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Creation of Adam&#39;s body, I&#39;m very careful with this, because before the creation of Adam&#39;s body, Adam existed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you wanna go back to the very beginning, God created Adam, and you and me, and every other creature, initially.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we were all wonderful in God&#39;s kingdom until the great feud happened.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Now, I found an answer to this question. Dr. Khalifa: Let&#39;s have it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Adam didn&#39;t exist before the expression would be in this way, God created the creatures, and then named him Adam.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Right, there you go. There you go. Yes. Edip: I think this is it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, when we put all these pieces together, it&#39;s obvious that God created all the creatures.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were all in His kingdom. Everything was going nicely, until the feud happened. The feud happened when Satan had these ideas, and then the creatures had different opinions,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the vast majority upholding God&#39;s absolute authority, a small minority agreeing with Satan.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then, this small minority was given another chance to submit.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The animals and the stars and the trees submitted, but the humans continued to defy God and agree with Satan.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then the creation or the execution of the plan, which is, we&#39;re all familiar with now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think the location of the bodies, obviously is not relevant, where the bodies were.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The point is they were invisible to them until they broke God&#39;s law. Then, they were sucked into their bodies and sent down here to Earth to start the test.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Yes. A man: (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: The second goal is the idea that the souls are hurled into the body, that each body,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">each soul has its identified body, and it&#39;s put into it because of what it has done. Dr. Khalifa: Right. Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: (Unintelligible) A man: And their Lord called down to them, you know, and said that they had not followed what He said,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible) from that tree, and warned them that the devil is their most ardent enemy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was just to let us understand that each body, that the bodies, souls are assigned to their bodies, their physical bodies, and we have (unintelligible) to the souls.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: What is the first thing we do when we come to this world? Dr. Khalifa: Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: The soul is assigned to the body, and the first thing we do &quot;oh, no!&quot; And on top of that you get a spank.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everywhere, they cry. A man: I think that&#39;s what she&#39;s saying, I think (unintelligible) just threw me out of the body, and there (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, that&#39;s why she doesn&#39;t see, at the minute, she (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: It doesn&#39;t matter. Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Yes. A man: (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: What happens? Yes. A man: (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Exactly</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Yeah. That&#39;s why I asked you, what was the first thing you asked when you came back?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What is happening? Why am I here? Why are you here? What are you doing here? What happened?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ihsan: I couldn&#39;t have done anything with my body. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Ihsan: She said the police stopped her because she didn&#39;t know how to put the lights on in the car</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and help her to go to the hospital, and I had no idea. I was sitting in the back of the car and I had no idea what was going on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Did he tell her, why don&#39;t you turn the lights on? The police told her (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Talk of out of body experience.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Atif: (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Wait a minute. Slow down. Slow down. Because this is wonderful, also. I forget that Atif has all these experiences.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&#39;s telling about somebody who had an out-of-body experience. And they were operating on the person?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Atif: They were having some dental work on his teeth. Dr. Khalifa: Oh, dental work. Ok. Go ahead.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Atif: He didn&#39;t know. All the work on his teeth is when he got out of his body. His mother was sitting out in the waiting room.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And as soon as he got out, you know, &quot;the guy doesn&#39;t move, doesn&#39;t talk, doesn&#39;t do nothing.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, they called for (unintelligible) an emergency.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they got the team and they started pumping his chest and giving him fluids. Dr. Khalifa: And he was watching.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Atif: And they were rolling around having fun watching him. And these kids (unintelligible) about to die.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You just think &quot;usually people don&#39;t die in the dental office.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the doctor was so nervous. (unintelligible) He went outside in the waiting room</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And his mother was sitting there. And he lifted the bottle in his hand, giving him fluids, trying to get him back. And he went there (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I went there. And then I went by my mother. I (unintelligible) her left shoulder. I&#39;m looking. That&#39;s not the way you say it. (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked in the (unintelligible) magazine. Actually, I wanted to see what she was reading. And then after a while, I decided to go back.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I went back. (unintelligible) I went back to his body. So, he revived. So, the doctor and the nurse got him back. They never got him back. He was just outside.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And after he finished, he went to his mother. And of course, after they got him back, the doctor went to his mother and said &quot;oh, we&#39;re so sorry your son</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was in a different room. We almost lost him. But we worked hard and got him back.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we&#39;re so happy. And, you know, before what happened, so after his mother took him back, he told her, you know</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;all this stuff happened. I was out of my body. I was just roaming around.&quot; Of course, she&#39;s happy. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, I told her &quot;yeah, I was out. You were sitting in the chair by the window. I was right here on your shoulder.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;And you were looking at the magazine.&quot; She said &quot;yes.&quot; &quot;And you were reading an article about so and so.&quot; She said &quot;yes. How did you know that?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Because I was out there. I was looking at you.&quot; So, I said &quot;you know, the time was out.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He didn&#39;t care about what they were doing to. his body. He put needles on him. They beat him up. Atif: He was having fun. He was having fun. Dr. Khalifa: Exactly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was thinking, you know, it could be like you said. Adam had been outside having so much fun in Paradise, my God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He didn&#39;t care about small things (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Besides, he had never seen his body before that. Atif: Yeah, that&#39;s another thing. That was a shock. Dr. Khalifa: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Talk of Jesus and crucification.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: Rashad, (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: had no record or impression of the needles, the pain, and whatever. Dr. Khalifa: There&#39;s no pain.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: There&#39;s no pain. A woman: When he goes back in, he has no record of... Dr. Khalifa: Actually, this tells us exactly what Jesus felt when they crucified him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: That&#39;s what I was thinking. No,... Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: Because Jesus was gone. This is, I mean, God is... look how God is teaching us. A woman: Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Real life experiences. This is a physical scientist, a surgeon, you know.

Even at the time of the Prophet Muhammad, they could not witness the fact that he is Rasulullah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just he&#39;s saying he&#39;s Rasulullah.

Jesus, the person, left.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He left the spirit and the body.

Just somebody dies (unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&#39;s been alive for 20 years.

A man: But when God says that I blew into him from My spirit, then what does that mean?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: That&#39;s the spirit that caused life.

He just...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Just recently, in San Francisco, some person died. Just one person died.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: He donated six different organs to six different people. Atif: Yes. A man: Who do you think it is?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible) to donate (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: I wouldn&#39;t do it mainly because of maybe (unintelligible) Because of the humiliation the body goes through.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because I&#39;ve seen it. A man: What&#39;s the difference if you&#39;re dead and gone? What is... Dr. Khalifa: It doesn&#39;t make any difference. I want my body cremated and flushed down the toilet. I don&#39;t want it, I don&#39;t want it pulled around with it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They hang it, they hang them like a cow from a ceiling. And It&#39;s really mistreated.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Atif: They don&#39;t do that. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Yes, they do that.

A man: Rashad, (unintelligible). A man: Before you get into that, there was a scandal in England that over-enthusiastic, you know, doctors would kill a person.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Oh, my God. A man: Yes. A man: When you said &quot;I would like to (unintelligible)&quot;, you&#39;re not already dead.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Just hurry up. A man: They need a heart somewhere. Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible). A man: And through their enthusiasm they&#39;ll just finish you off. That&#39;s what they do.

Atif: That was a rumor. But I was at this...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some of the patients in the ICU were very sick, very sick patients. They had a breathing machine, everything, medication for the heart, and everything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I felt so bad about it. And We had orders. (unintelligible) Well, half of the family told us to donate the organs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I feel so bad about it. Some people just don&#39;t take it well. You know, somebody... If a family member is still alive and you told him &quot;can I take your heart?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Atif: It&#39;s just a terrible thing. And there&#39;s so much burden on me. Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible). And I remember this guy was so embarrassed. Almost that could not even talk. He wanted to talk to his wife.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I told him, you know, &quot;if something happens to him, we need to do this or that.&quot; And he was so angry, almost so (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She responded so fast. I was so suspicious. She was hoping to finish him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was just giving information so fast. And I remember. I got shocked. My God, this woman was finishing him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was so attached to the patient. I didn&#39;t want him to get over this and recover. Dr. Khalifa: Oh, she hated him. Atif: Oh, yes. She hated him. She had so much (unintelligibile), she was gonna get out of here. (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible). Atif: Some people do have this syndrome. &quot;Yeah, finish him. Yeah, (unintelligible).&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: &quot;Where do I have to sign?&quot; &quot;Can you do it yesterday?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: &quot;You need to take the organs.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Atif: &quot;You need to take the organs&quot; They have to take everything. Atif: It&#39;s just like your surgery, they keep you breathing and everything, they open you and take everything out, everything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: What if he&#39;s still alive? I mean,... Atif: (unintelligible) could be, I mean... Of course, it&#39;s very difficult to define the moment of death.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There have been meetings and meetings, conferences and could nobody knows exactly when the moment of death is.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Who defines death? Who says this guy is dead or not? And I think the final thing he decided to do is check the brain.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he issues a brain electricity wave.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if he lost his wave in the brain location, he declares him dead.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we always know here that people have been on the breathing machine for years and they just rise there and they just don&#39;t function. Their brain&#39;s dead.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we see a lot. So, if the brain is dead, your body actually... your heart is still beating, your kidneys are still functioning.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it&#39;s amazing when people have their brains dead, their body is in excellent shape. If they ever get to the point where they can transplant the brain, this is the moment when you get somebody back. It just never happened anyway because it&#39;s so complicated.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Atif: which actually, you know, most probably the brain is the soul, you know. If you get somebody&#39;s brain transplanted, you actually need to transplant a soul in this body.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s a perfect body, except the brain is dead. So, these are the people, young, healthy guys in a car accident.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible) And these are the guys who have everything clean. You just take the heart, kidneys, everything and give it to somebody else.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the soul is gone. A man: The soul must be in brain. A man: connected with the brain.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: No, no. The brain is just the physical... Atif: The physical part that expresses the soul.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Probably. What&#39;s that? Dr. Khalifa: It&#39;s the physical tool. It&#39;s like you and the computer. You can think of the brain as a computer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Atif: You&#39;re not running the computer. Dr. Khalifa: You have to run it. Atif: If you don&#39;t know how to run a computer, you&#39;ll think they&#39;re all the same.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: What stimulates brain to work? Dr. Khalifa: See, the brain is only but electrons moving around, just like the computer exactly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, it&#39;s a clumsy representation of the brain. A man: But I&#39;ve read articles that you can add or remove some hormones. You can do different stimuli. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Because they affect the function of the brain, but the brain is strictly physical.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Atif: Yes, of course, there&#39;s a map of the brain. This is the foot, this is the hand, this is the ear, and mechanically or electrically</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you touch these areas and make what you want, which is the physical part. But like you&#39;re saying, you, the real person, you, is the soul.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cause you&#39;re just using these organs for your benefit, using the eyes, using the ears</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Including the brain. Dr. Khalifa: I thank God for my out-of-body experience that I had many years ago cause</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was looking at my body down there and it was just like a piece of rock.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Amount of hormones, who determines that hormone? What determines the amount of the other hormones, that hormone?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there must be all of them that determines the amount of hormones in the brain and their stimulation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: There is a maestro. A maestro orchestrates the levels of hormones.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Or the physical, it destroys the physical by itself or from others but that soul cannot communicate with our world through this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: One receiver, radio, we have a receiver or the other station that radiates.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And one of them - how do you say it? - it doesn&#39;t work.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Nothing happens. Edip: Nothing happens Dr. Khalifa: You&#39;d have to have a transmitter and a receiver.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: That&#39;s when you say the brain is dead. But here, that&#39;s my understanding of what I already know. That&#39;s every function we do. That&#39;s all that comes from the brain?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Atif: A lot of organs have their own, what we call, also mechanisms. You know, the heart can keep beating with a special built-in mechanism.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: Does it come from there? Atif: The heart will regulate certain things, certain things, like how fast it goes, which one to, you know,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">which to pump more blood and which to pump less blood. There&#39;s a control, of course, but some organs have their own built-in mechanism.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the brain has to balance it. You have to balance the kidney with the heart with the whole balance system.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you can... one work more than the others, then you lost everything. So, the brain has that but you know, you see, like the computer, you have to set exactly for the second, for millionth of second,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">how much blood comes out and how much the heart beats would go and how much goes to your</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">big toe and how much goes to your feet. So, all this is exactly controlled. If you lose the brain, this is what really controlled very much.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the heart, I think, we all have seen it in chicken, when you cut their neck completely</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and let it go, it&#39;s gonna run for a little bit, you know, until the brain is completely... A woman: Yeah, for a little bit, but if it&#39;s for a long time, can they...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Atif: No, no, for human beings, (unintelligible). So, these people, they have to kill the machines. What the machine does is just keep bumping things with the heart and make it come back.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They have to keep putting oxygen down the lung against the will and go up. We have to have things work for the kidney.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And also for a period of time. After a while, everything is deteriorating because you can never balance, do the balance as much as the brain.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Your chemistry is completely screwed up when the brain goes away. Edip: Sometimes they are still alive when they make brain surgery on birds and take their brains (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, the lungs are the same way as the heart. It&#39;s all mechanical. Atif: When we were little kids, we used to get things like the goose lung and a blow on it to make fun of it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can see the whole thing like a balloon in and out. You do the same thing with that guy. (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You just want to be up (unintelligible) and his heart is pumping, you know, the blood goes, the oxygen goes back.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then they have equipment where they put special pumps inside the heart and just keep all the blood closed and just pump the blood from the heart.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All kinds of fancy stuff. A man: I don&#39;t understand. For example, if brain does not work properly, the body&#39;s malfunction, the speech malfunction, or the soul&#39;s malfunction?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Just the body.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Atif: You know, most probably, (unintelligible), we can procure organs for them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We do have some functions of the brain that keep things (unintelligible) going.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:29:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the part which really does do the thinking and the real living, which is the soul, it&#39;s, you know, I&#39;m sure if you open his head, most of them can find a little bruise on it. This is what qualifies the rest of the brain as OK.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:29:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But actually, we look at it this way, the brain is dead, which actually means the soul is out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:29:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The brain might have been OK, but we don&#39;t know that. I mean, you can physically say the soul is out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:29:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can do that. All you can say is that the brain is dead. The brain is dead is actually the soul is out. The brain is intact? Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:29:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Atif: Yeah, but I think (unintelligible) the brain is intact. The soul is out. It doesn&#39;t work. So,... A woman: (unintelligible). When the brain is dead, the person actually is dead.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:29:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: The person is gone. A woman: gone. A woman: But maybe there is some function. Atif: Oh, yeah, the (unintelligible) is functioning. A woman: But the brain is dead, is dead.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:29:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Atif: I think brain.... Dr. Khalifa: Sometimes the brain is not dead and the person is gone. Like, in case of Bill Schroeder who lived 19 months without the soul.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:29:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: The body was functioning. The person was eating and drinking and going to the bathroom. But he didn&#39;t recognize... A woman: See, because I knew... I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:30:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: I can&#39;t remember the name of this guy, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:30:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: He had some surgery. And after, during the time of surgery, when the surgery finished, he was asleep at that time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:30:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then he woke up. Wake up and after that... But for a long time, 10 or 15 years, he was in that situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:30:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he was dead. Actually, he was dead. Dr. Khalifa: What happened after the 10 years?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:30:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: And then he, yeah, came, yeah. Dr. Khalifa: Came back? Atif: You know what this was (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:30:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ask me I have more experience. (unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:30:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: No, this would be like the people of the cave. They went to sleep for 300 years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:31:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: Because of that, everybody knew about him. Atif: I heard about a few days would be this. You know (unintelligible). In one of these days, she came back.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:31:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Perfect. And that&#39;s why nothing happened. A man: Did she come back? Atif: I don&#39;t know. I was just reading about it. I have no experience with her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:31:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible) the same way. But that&#39;s why so many families, when they have a loved one in a similar situation, already brain dead, they always have been for this minute when</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:31:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">their loved ones will come back, like these little stories we hear. And most of the time, it doesn&#39;t. Most of the time, your body deteriorates.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:31:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sitting in bed, you get a great sore, you get pneumonia, you get all kinds of infections. And you keep (unintelligible) your body, waiting for it to come back.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:31:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And nobody knows if you ever come back. And you start seeing your loved ones getting in terrible, miserable shape. I mean, you have (unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:31:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: But we have this in the Quran. People of the cave were asleep for 309 years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:32:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Atif: But did anybody walk in this cave?

It&#39;s a blessing, yes. See, what is happening</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">when there is a messenger, God is sending information to the whole group through the messenger.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the messenger himself is benefiting from this information, so it will save us a lot of trouble if we obey.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This includes the messenger and the people because this information comes to everybody.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Actually, I see this in my last trip to Canada, for example.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mentioned the issue of the age of 40. And I assumed that everybody accepted it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But they didn&#39;t. And I ended up wasting so much time on it. And it&#39;s a blessing if the people have the understanding of, for example, this verse.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&#39;ll be so comfortable if they have the conviction and understanding.

So, I appreciate the fact that this verse deals specifically with disobedience to the messenger.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s obedience in matters that have to do with God and information that&#39;s coming from God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible) It&#39;s not personal obedience.

This is actually written in history. They were all ready to obey you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they did move on to some other place.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay.

So, the word, people under-aged, excuse us, but they said that they had sex with the camel.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is what they said.

They said &quot;why did you translate this &quot;they slaughtered the camel&quot;?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, we really are living the Quran.

So the word in the Quran, what they did to the camel was slaughtering.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, they said &quot;Aqaroo&quot; means &quot;they&#39;re having sex with the camel, not killing.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, perverts.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s what they are.

And in the second chapter of the Quran where it says that the believers are those who believe in the unseen, and this was part of the unseen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I knew that, IN SHAA ALLAH, at the time, that God would explain it to me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And one of the blessings of being in this mosque is having things explained to us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And as Rashad said in the Khutba today &quot;it&#39;s the mercy from God that He sends a messenger from among us to explain to us.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The knowledge is here in the Quran, and all of us have read the Quran. You know, I read it once a month from front to back, and every time there&#39;s something new.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we get what we need at the time we need it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we, in this mosque, are just developing so far. It&#39;s just amazing. You know, Rashad and Lisa and Hasan went to Canada, and there where the people believed the way we do,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">there&#39;s still (unintelligible) behind us in the knowledge, because we&#39;re here every Friday night, learning and studying.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have the input of all these believers here and learning and studying. We have the input of all these believers here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we have a messenger that is given the knowledge that is passed on to us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lori: And we&#39;re responsible for the information in this mosque. Dr. Khalifa: This was directed to the humans and the jinns.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, there were two kinds of creatures, creatures that sided with Satan completely, the jinns,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and the creatures that did not... they were neutral, didn&#39;t make a stand with God. That&#39;s you and me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God decided to give us the body of man, originally of the same material as the earth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We are earth now. But the jinns have a body of fire, fire. It&#39;s the difference.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Satan and jinn&rsquo;s invisible to us so they can whisper &ndash; Jinn&rsquo;s travel faster than speed of light. Jinns given a chance to see more of the universe.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We are in dimensions and they are in different dimensions. Because the agreement called for Satan to remain invisible, just like God is invisible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Satan wanted to whisper to us while being invisible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Therefore, they had to be made of a different material in a different dimension. Also, the jinns, they&#39;re made from energy. It gives them the abilities to travel a lot faster than the speed of light, millions of times the speed of light.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They can go to the outer limit of our universe, 26 billion light years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this gives them more to see, more evidence. God is giving them more evidence because they made a hard stand against God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, when they go to Hell in the Hereafter, it seems like this whole life is really to nullify the excuses</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the humans and the jinns, the creatures who did not make a firm stand on God&#39;s absolute authority.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, had God listened to the angels initially and said &quot;okay, all those who didn&#39;t make a stand</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on My absolute authority are banished, are out. Go to Hell&quot;, they would have said &quot;oh, you didn&#39;t give us another chance. We didn&#39;t know how bad Hell is. You didn&#39;t give us warnings.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this life is designed so that when the people insist, that the jinns insist on going to Hell, they will not be able to say that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They will not be able to say &quot;you didn&#39;t give us a chance. You didn&#39;t give us warnings. We didn&#39;t know what we were doing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If You told us how bad it is here in Hell, we would have made a difference.&quot; God told us everything, the humans and the jinns.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He told us how bad Hell is, how to get out of it, how to redeem ourselves, how to make it back to God&#39;s kingdom.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the jinns, because they have this strong stand, they are given a chance to see more of the universe.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And to convince them to redeem themselves. We were wishy-washy and this is the extent that we need to make that decision and to redeem ourselves.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have these different bodies. A woman: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: This is it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Of course. Dr. Khalifa: We have....In the museum, there was one show on the Friday show before the elections. (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they had this magician, a fellow who uses jinns, I&#39;m sure.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And before the elections, two weeks before the elections, on the show, they decided to put, he said &quot;I&#39;m going to put in this envelope</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">who&#39;s going to win the elections and how many votes.&quot; And he sealed the envelope. That was two weeks before the elections.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he said &quot;on the election day, the next day, they would open the envelope and they would see</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that he wrote down two weeks back, two weeks ago, who won the elections and how many votes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How would he do that? Can you guess? What did they do? A woman: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: No. A woman: So, what did they do?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Ok. They don&#39;t know the future. The jinns don&#39;t know the future. They&#39;re just like us. But what they did, they waited until the newspaper came out and they said &quot;Reagan won and here are the number of votes.&quot; Then, they go in the envelope and they write.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s right. That&#39;s how they do it. Because this is the number of votes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, what I&#39;m saying, what I&#39;m saying is they go into envelope (unintelligible). A woman: But tell me this now...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible). A woman: On the news, they showed pictures of Mars and this is why they said that the Russians (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they found two faces on Mars and they thought it was a shadow.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, they did a close-up and then they did a computer enhancement and saw teeth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The eyes and the teeth, they understood. Dr. Khalifa: No. A woman: I&#39;m thinking about it (unintelligible) about Rashad</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rashad said &quot;the jinns went there because they can leave early (unintelligible). Right and they can go up there and plant these things for us to see. And they prove to us (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: No.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And while we&#39;re busy worrying about this little thing on Mars, they sneak up, you know what I&#39;m saying?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: They have (unintelligible). They cannot do anything without God&#39;s will. So, if God wants us to be fooled in that way, He will allow it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But they cannot slap you in the face, for example. They&#39;re sitting there and (unintelligible). First of all, each one of us has one.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those are not free yet. And then, there are the ones that have been freed of the dead people, our grandparents.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They come here regularly and listen to Quranic studies. It is recorded in the (unintelligible). There&#39;s a person that says &quot;some jinns heard the Quran and went to their families and friends and told them &quot;we heard a wonderful Quran.&quot;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is one. We have this kind of body and the jinns that kind of body.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible). This says &quot;use me, O Lord, in Thy work.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And in parentheses, especially, in an advisory capacity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay, anything else? There was something here about death. I want you to think of death as getting rid of this lousy body</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and getting a new body that does not get sick or die. That&#39;s what death is, smooth from stage to stage.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And usually it happens when you&#39;re sick and tired of this one. And you want a new one.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible). You see, the balance in number seven can be understood by different generations, but now we understand the environmental balance, for example.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why do we have so many rabbits? What do they reproduce so much? The wilderness.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You see, the foxes need food. There&#39;s an environmental balance. Foxes.... The coyotes did not need the rabbits to be invaded.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are hundreds of rabbits right here. So, I mean, this is a type of balance, well known.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Cheating cost you a lot&rdquo; &ndash; new heaven new Earth in the Bible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was studied in school. (unintelligible) that there was some biological balance in the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But this balance covers everything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And worrying has to do with cheating. It&#39;s a very important commandment. So,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Prophet Shu&lsquo;aib was sent just for that particular commandment, not to cheat in trading.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we break this commandment, it costs us a lot.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You cheat in paying your rent, collecting your rent, doing your work, or whatever, it will cost you a lot, more than you cheat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is God&#39;s commandment. It&#39;s one of the very important commandments. I believe what is an ideal person in honesty and truthfulness.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay, if there are no questions, we&#39;ll go to 37.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: What would that mean? Dr. Khalifa: The sky is blue now, right? A woman: Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: So, the Hereafter will be pink, will be rosy. It will be almost like Cherie&#39;s blouse, a little lighter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a beautiful sky at the sunset or the sunrise. So, they studied (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Psychologists, psychiatrists said that the most peaceful color is this, this color</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, they suggested that people who are tense to get a piece of this color (unintelligible) for a couple of minutes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sky will be like that on the Day of Judgement.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the way, Laurie mentioned substitution of the earth with a new earth, the heavens with the new heavens</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we see this in the Old Testament and the New Testament as well. Most of the prophecies, in the Old Testament, are in the book of Isaiah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if you want to put this (unintelligible) and put down Isaiah 65:22, it talks about substitution of a new heaven, a new earth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">65:22 Isaiah. Also, in 66:7.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">66:7 That&#39;s the very end of the book of Isaiah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And also in the New Testament, you find it in the second book of Peter 3:13.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">3, the verse number is 13. Both of them talk about substitution of a new heaven, new earth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Quran and the Old Testament. The Old Testament and the New Testament and the Final Testament are identical in that respect.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is, this is one fact that God wants you to know. On the Day of Judgement, the color of the sky is going to be rosy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is this something about Mars?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I remember one of the cameras that went to Mars (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, the reason our sky is blue is the diffraction of the light. You know, (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the blue happens to hit the atmosphere of the earth at such an angle that it gets deflected.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible) So, this is God&#39;s design.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it&#39;s blue. Now if the... If the sunlight becomes a little, changes just the angle hitting the atmosphere, some other color will be deflected.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: It&#39;s a very simple matter. A man: The reason we see the sunset as being pinkish or red is because of the sun (unintelligible)....</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: .... that it&#39;s the reflection of the sun (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: And say, you know, (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Also, the deflection is different, at sunrise and sunset.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m glad you brought this up. There&#39;s a deflection and reflection and diffraction.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When you go fishing and you put a stick in the water, you see the stick go like this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s a great stick, but you can see it&#39;s called...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I forget now (unintelligible), reflection, diffraction and all those terms.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the sunlight hits the earth atmosphere and this happens to it. It depends on which angle, which light (unintelligible) This is what changes the colors.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So anyway, one of the things that God wants us to know is that the sky is rosy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s very pleasant only to the believers, pleasant to the believers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laurie: In verse 39, we&#39;re told that on the Day of Resurrection that neither jinns nor humans will be asked about their sins because it won&#39;t be necessary.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We know from other verses in the Quran that everything that we&#39;ve done in our lifetime has been reported</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">by reporters that are honest and never miss anything at all.

And in Sura 17, we&#39;re told that the differences in the Hereafter, I mean...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this room, the differences in our sizes are within a few inches.

This is why nobody will need to ask anybody for their sins.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is so obvious. There&#39;ll be no question.

So, the conclusion is that God does not put a single person in Hell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is the people who insist or choose, and they insist on going to Hell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The whole thing will be automatic in the Hereafter.

You are very, very special people. You&#39;ve got to go to the Highest, Highest, Highest Heaven. I&#39;m gonna explain to you why.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Abraham started the religion of Islam, according to God&#39;s instructions, he and the people around him were worshipping God alone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And as time went by, Satan sneakily and gradually added idol worship until the time of Muhammad came.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some centuries later, by the time Muhammad came, they were worshipping lots of idols,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Allaat, Manaat, Al-&lsquo;Uzzah and all that. They were in the Ka&lsquo;bah that Abraham built.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you&#39;ve read how many verses in Quran that say &quot;Abraham was never an idol worshipper.&quot; And yet there is the Ka&lsquo;bah that he built that was full of idols.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then, God renewed the message, sent the Quran to Muhammad, and sent Muhammad to tell the people &quot;the idols are bad. Worship God alone. Worship God alone.&quot; So, what happened?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, Muhammad and his company were persecuted severely. They threw on them all kinds of dirt and bones.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, they banished them when they grew. There were about 10 or 15 people for about 3 years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, they grew to about maybe 25 or 30 people. Then, they thought they were getting too strong. So, they banished them out of Mecca, boycotted them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, and those people were abused. So, those have to have a special place in Heaven.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They went against the current. They were worshipping God alone in an ocean of idolatry.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can easily see that they are very special people. They will be in the highest place in the High Heaven.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because even within the High Heaven and the Low Heaven, there&#39;ll be ranks. Ok, now, 20 years ago, you see how it says here &quot;few from the later generations,&quot; the later generations after Muhammad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">1400 years after Muhammad, there is not a single mosque in the Muslim world that was worshipping God alone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is upholding the commandment &quot;the mosque belongs to God. You shall not mention other names with God.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then God renewed the message, right now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the message went loud and clear, ringing throughout the whole world &quot;worship God alone. Say &quot;La Elaha Ella Allah&quot;&quot;,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">not &quot;La Elaha Ella Allah Muhammad Rasulallah.&quot; And &quot;devote yourself to God alone. Uphold the commandments of the Quran. Purify your worship. Your Prayer is wrong,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Your fasting is wrong. Your Zakat is wrong.&quot; These are, these are all blessings from God that He sent to our generation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And again, we are subject to the same persecution, the same ridicule, lucky us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yours truly cannot go into any country in the Middle East. I&#39;ll be shot within 24 hours.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just stabilize it. And if you go to the Middle East, you better disown me. I&#39;m asking you to do that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, God says, even disown God, if you are under those circumstances, as long as your heart is filled with faith.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you don&#39;t wanna get into trouble, you better tell them &quot;I don&#39;t know Rashad Khalifa&quot; on purpose. But this is... you are very, very special people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;ve gone through the mill of ridicule and mocking.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Today, Tasneem calls you from New York, and she was talking to some relatives of her in Chicago, who are very active in the so-called Islamic Center.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And she told them &quot;I&#39;m devoting myself to God alone. I only say &quot;La Elaha Ella Allah.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And guess what they said? They said &quot;Tasneem went to the dogs.&quot; She&#39;s worshiping God alone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, this is ridicule, right? They ridiculed her. You know, you&#39;re saying &quot;La Elaha Ella Allah.&quot; You&#39;re saying &quot;worship God alone.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You mean, God alone. That&#39;s all you have, God?&quot; I mean, do you see the logic? They&#39;re ridiculing her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mahmood was working the other night, and some so-called Muslims walked in the store.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they saw the label, it says &quot;Muhammad&quot; on Mahmood, on the label. They said &quot;are you a Muslim?&quot; He said &quot;yes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They said &quot;how come we don&#39;t see you at the mosque?&quot; He said &quot;how come I don&#39;t see you at the mosque?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, they said &quot;oh, you mean, you go to that mosque?&quot; Because the mosque that worships God alone, right?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, Noah, if you remember in the Quran, Noah said, cause Noah was building the ark, with the</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">flat, float, whatever you call it, water raft.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they were laughing at him. And he told them, he said &quot;you&#39;re laughing at me, but I&#39;m really laughing at you.&quot; And that&#39;s what Mahmood was actually doing in the store.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because they said &quot;oh, we never believed in mathematics. A woman: Oh, God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, on that day, they probably had an exam in calculus, right? In university.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they had to follow the formulas and the equations, and otherwise they would flunk.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, they believe in mathematics. But if it comes to God and the Quran, and worshiping God alone, they don&#39;t believe in mathematics.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, they were looking at Mahmood, you know, ridiculing him, and of course, in his heart, he knows &quot;fool souls.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just like Noah, he was ridiculing them. Just like, I mean, he was laughing at them, just like they were laughing at him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But this makes Mahmood a very special person. This is what it means, &quot;multitudes from the early generations.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We are the first generation of renewing the message. And we see it very clearly. Every one of us is in the light, and we can see it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just go in any mosque in the world and say &quot;La Elaha Ella Allah,&quot; they will beat you up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You are saying &quot;worship God alone.&quot; So, you can see what happens after centuries, from the first generation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Abraham was a first generation. And those people, I mean, they threw Abraham in the fire, right?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In those days, there was no America for Abraham to run to.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They threw him in the fire, so what did God do? He turned the fire into a cool and safe place.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because God, God says &quot;do not think that I will abandon my messengers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God creates exits for them. So, the exit for Abraham was a cool and safe fire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the people who were with him, they were persecuted. They had to be special people, because the easiest thing is to go along with the masses, with the crowds.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You think this shook Mahmood? Not one hair. And this is why he is very special.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m just using Mahmood as an example. Muhtesem went to a grocery store to buy some Middle Eastern stuff.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he met some Arabs there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&#39;re just totally ignorant. They know nothing. But he says &quot;yes, we saw too much in Tucson. We worship God alone.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they almost beat him up. If he wasn&#39;t big enough and strong enough.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And a Turk. He would have been beaten. So, why do you have to take all this abuse?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And all this ridicule. Do you think it shook him up? Did it affect his faith?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If anything, it strengthened his faith. Because he knows that those people are off. He knows they&#39;re ignorant.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He knows they&#39;re not worshipping God alone. He knows they lost the Prayer. They probably never prayed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These people, do you think they prayed? Muhtesem: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Right. Right. They don&#39;t know?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: They don&#39;t know?

The Bashar&#39;s, they ridiculed them so many times.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Do you really go to that mosque?&quot; And the answer is &quot;show me a place where they worship God alone that I go.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We go to that place.&quot; I will go to that place.

God is the one who provides for you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God is the One who controls your health, your welfare.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God is the One who controls your happiness. God is the only One who controls your success.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Muhammad is dead. The saints are dead. Jesus is dead. Powerless. Even when they were alive. They had absolutely no power.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, (unintelligible). Because you are going through. This is the first generation. We are,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We are so lucky. We are a first generation, just like Abraham&#39;s generation, Muhammad&#39;s generation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">People who follow the crowd &ldquo;jumping on the wagon&rdquo; of an established belief. Believers get a pinch when they stray off the path.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Muhammad&#39;s generation are ones who went through the ridicule, the abuse. And they had to leave their city, Mecca and go to Medina.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The persecution they went through. Because of this, God reserves a special place for them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God is reserving a special place for us. I&#39;m saying it by God&#39;s grace.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I have this very good news for you. What you are, you fit here in verse 13. Multitude from the early generations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In 50 years, I assure you, in 50 years, there&#39;ll be millions of people worshipping God alone, upholding the Quran alone and praying the correct way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Millions. In just 50 years. But they will be following the crowd.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They cannot be like you. They will be protected by their numbers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right at this location, right here, there&#39;ll be thousands on this block, in this mosque.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there&#39;ll be powerful, the people jumping on the wagons. But they don&#39;t deserve the same position or the same credit as you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is what it means. &quot;Multitude from the early generations, but only a few from the last generations.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because these are the far ahead, in Arabic, (56:10) &#1649;&#1604;&#1587;&#1614;&#1617;&#1600;&#1648;&#1576;&#1616;&#1602;&#1615;&#1608;&#1606;&#1614; &#1649;&#1604;&#1587;&#1614;&#1617;&#1600;&#1648;&#1576;&#1616;&#1602;&#1615;&#1608;&#1606;&#1614; These will be the closest to God. They are very special.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that is you. And you start collecting benefits now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we&#39;ve seen it. We have a history already. We have a track record in this mosque for 10 years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have a track record, a perfect track record. In this life.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s guaranteed by God. You may have a pinch here and there, but it&#39;s because we make mistakes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The tests are brief for you. But if you stray off the path, you know you&#39;re gonna get the pinch.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Angels have wings 2, 3 and 4&rdquo;. Those who except ridicule and persecution for their belief are special people and attain the high ranks. Satan hates you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you get the pinch and say &quot;thank You, God&quot;, and come back to the path. You are very special people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You deserve a lot of congratulations. God says in Sura 35 that the angels have wings, two, three, and four.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Two, three, and four, because the angels closest to God will be the most powerful, the highest in rank.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;ll have more wings. This is figuratively speaking. And these (56:10) &#1649;&#1604;&#1587;&#1614;&#1617;&#1600;&#1648;&#1576;&#1616;&#1602;&#1615;&#1608;&#1606;&#1614; &#1649;&#1604;&#1587;&#1614;&#1617;&#1600;&#1648;&#1576;&#1616;&#1602;&#1615;&#1608;&#1606;&#1614;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">these far ahead people. Like (unintelligible), you&#39;ll be there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, all those are angels, but still, they have ranks. And 50 years from now, the thousands of people will be in this location, IN SHAA ALLAH. They will go to the High Heaven because they worship God alone</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and they will pray the correct way. And they&#39;ll go to the High Heaven, but they cannot attain your rank, because you&#39;re the ones who are taking the abuse.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The people who take the abuse and the ridicule have a very special position in the Bible and in the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had a little thing that I hang in there for a while that says &quot;congratulations to those who are persecuted.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, the prophets also have been persecuted, remember that verse? I had it hanging here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is God telling you &quot;congratulations.&quot; (unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, we are very, very lucky. And I&#39;m stressing, I keep stressing this, because I cannot stress it enough.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just so we can thank God and be appreciative, so you know who you are.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Satan will always put doubts in your mind. Always will tell you &quot;you&#39;re nobody.&quot; He hates your guts, okay?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because it&#39;s going to be deep, deep in Hell. You hear that, Iman? You&#39;re asking about Satan and the Hereafter?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He will not be in Heaven, no. He will not even come close. He and his troops will be way deep down in the lowest pit of Hell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he&#39;ll be beating them and they&#39;ll be beating him. They&#39;re gonna spend eternity doing that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, he will try to tell you &quot;you&#39;re a nobody&quot;, but you speak back to him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You tell him &quot;I believe God.&quot; And I believe that I am in this group, multitudes in the early generations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because this is a first generation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, I couldn&#39;t believe it myself. For a long time just &quot;it couldn&#39;t be just us here worshipping God alone. There must be millions in the world.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I discovered that I&#39;m naive, that the human being is really bad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was talking to my nephew, Sharif, in Egypt. He said &quot;I&#39;m the only one in Egypt.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He really is a believer. You can tell the people who believe, because they are in the light. They understand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he&#39;s the only one that I know in Egypt, (unintelligible). He said &quot;really, I believe.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">IN SHAA ALLAH, he will come for the conference. He&#39;s only 20.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was born two weeks before Beth. And he&#39;s the only believer in all of Egypt.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, I was really naive.

So, this is why I&#39;m speaking so strongly. And I&#39;m telling you &quot;you&#39;re very special.&quot; And when Satan tells you &quot;you&#39;re not&quot;, you tell him to shut up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;re very special This is the verse that talks about you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Congratulations.

God says that anything we wish for, anything those who are in the Highest Heaven, IN SHAA ALLAH, we&#39;ll be there,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anything they wish for and even more.

This verse tells you it was not Abraham&#39;s intelligence that led him to discover God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God granted him the understanding because God knew that Abraham deserved to go to the High Heaven.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the other verse that I wish to share with you is Joseph. When Joseph almost fell for the governor&#39;s wife.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then God said &quot;if it were not that he saw a sign from his Lord.&quot; Then, God says &quot;we thus diverted sin from him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, was it Joseph who was so great that he didn&#39;t fall in sin? Or, was it God that protected him from sin?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was God that protected him from sin. By the way, the verse goes on and says, (12:24) &#1573;&#1616;&#1606;&#1614;&#1617;&#1607;&#1615;&#1765; &#1605;&#1616;&#1606;&#1618; &#1593;&#1616;&#1576;&#1614;&#1575;&#1583;&#1616;&#1606;&#1614;&#1575; &#1649;&#1604;&#1618;&#1605;&#1615;&#1582;&#1618;&#1604;&#1614;&#1589;&#1616;&#1610;&#1606;&#1614;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That he was one of our devoted servants.

And God knew that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is what God meant when he said to the angels. The angels said &quot;put them all in hell.&quot; And God said &quot;I know what you do not know.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, God knows that we were swept in the crowd. Some of us were swept in the crowd and do not deserve to go to hell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is why God granted Abraham his understanding. God granted you the fortune to come across the true message,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">worshipping Him alone and upholding His word alone. It&#39;s not because you&#39;re clever or because I&#39;m smart.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s because, apparently, God, not apparently, obviously God knew that some of us were swept</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in the crowd somehow. And we agreed with Satan.

In fact, if you look at verse 41, where you&#39;re holding the book now, you see in 41, it&#39;s the beginning of hell.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Once in the age of 41 you better be worshipping God alone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, those of you who make the decision, we look in the previous Sura, verse 41.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, now we know, we know from this circle here that these numbers of verses are designed, divinely designed, for a reason.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we have all these mathematical proofs. Once you get into the age of 41, you&#39;d better be worshipping God alone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just a second. I don&#39;t wanna forget what I&#39;m saying. So, had God left Martin Luther King to live beyond the age of 40,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he would have been swept. That&#39;s the word that brought me to the next Khutba two weeks from now. He would have been swept by his environment and his circumstances into maybe mentioning Jesus and things like that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible) He was a pastor in a church, I think. But in his heart, and even vocally, he never said anything about Jesus.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not that I heard of. In his vast amount of recordings, he always talked about God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is why God chose to take him at that time to protect him from going beyond to this number 41, and being swept by his environment and his circumstances into Christianity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, he will be like we see here on verse 90. [56:90] If he belongs with those on the right - [56:91] Then, peace to you from those on the right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We can be sure that God&#39;s justice put these people exactly in the right place.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He deserves to be in the Lower Heaven. When, when Satan made that blasphemy billions of years ago, there were degrees of convictions among us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To go from the jinns who completely agreed with Satan, to the majority of humans who were wishy-washy. They didn&#39;t...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to some who were swept in the crowd. And hopefully, that&#39;s us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, now Cathy has a question.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;re talking about a very special group of people who will be the closest to God on the Day of Judgement. They are very special people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this will be like when the Prophet Muhammad started to preach.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, let&#39;s go to Abraham. Abraham started Islam. And then there were people who were with him when the others were throwing him in the fire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then by the time the Prophet Muhammad came, they became idol worshippers. Then, the message was renewed by revealing the Quran through the Prophet Muhammad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he was secretly preaching. And there were people with him. Those are very special people. This is the first generation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then Muhammad became victorious and he opened Mecca. And all the people in Mecca became believers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They jumped in the wagon. But they do not deserve the same credit as the people who were with him when he was being persecuted and having stones thrown at him. And</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he was cursed and called names and persecuted.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Does this make sense? So, that was a first generation at the time of Ibrahim, at the time of Muhammad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then ten years ago, Islam was totally corrupted. There is not a single mosque in the world that upholds the commandment to mention only the name of God in the mosque,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in the worship practices and so on. And then God renewed the message with this miracle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, now we are a first generation. And the people who are in this movement, while it is being persecuted and the names and the insults and so on, are very special people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, ten years from now, we&#39;ll probably have millions. Maybe twenty years, fifty years from now. And everybody will jump in the wagon, but they do not deserve the same credit as you do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, these very special people will be multiplied from this generation. And after that, when it is famous and successful and it is the thing to do, they don&#39;t deserve the same credit. They will not be in the same rank.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is what we did last week when we were absent.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We didn&#39;t even know if it was really for you or not. We didn&#39;t have birth certificates then. By just guessing that the Prophet was holy, who was awakened and given the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it has nothing to do with that. It is in the Quran, Sura 46, verse 50, it says... It&#39;s what it says there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s based on that. Dr. Khalifa: Any other questions? Lisa: [57:4] .... He is with you wherever you may be. God is Seer of everything you do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He truly is in absolute control of the universe.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This verse, to me, expresses it very, very clearly and very, very beautifully.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Verse 5, [57:5] To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. God is in full control of all things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These verses again and again are saying absolutely what we&#39;ve been saying that God does everything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet it is so hard for us to accept that. You can hear it and you can say &quot;yes&quot;, but then you get sidetracked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, if I don&#39;t take my vitamins I&#39;m gonna get sick.&quot; You aren&#39;t gonna get sick unless you deserve to get sick.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t take your vitamins. Because God, you know, God has given us the vitamins. He has given us the medicines. He has given...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But we have to remember that God is the One who is controlling everything, who is doing everything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God controls our bosses. God controls our neighbors. God controls our spouses.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He controls not only the physical things. He controls the emotions, the hearts and the minds of those around us and of us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Rashad pointed out so beautifully, God bestowed on Abraham his righteousness, his understanding.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, God says very clearly that He bestows on all of us our righteousness. It&#39;s not us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s not ours. We... God gives it to us. He controls our hearts and our minds.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we make that one choice. The only thing we really control is that one choice of whether we worship God alone or not.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once we&#39;ve made that decision, He goes from there. He takes it from there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there are a lot of verses that talk about God misguiding those who disbelieve.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, they make..... A woman: Yeah. Any questions about the Lower Heaven?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How? 41.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hell goes right after 41. Wait, what?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s 41. My God. Yeah. Dr. Khalifa: This has a meaning.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Yep. 41 means hell. If you don&#39;t make that decision.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: If you don&#39;t make that decision by that time. A woman: Okay.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: That&#39;s clear. I mean, wait a minute. Dr. Khalifa: 41 and higher.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We didn&#39;t make the decision. A woman: Subhan Allah. Dr. Khalifa: Remember the circle?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This circle here means every verse in the Quran is numbered according to a system, God&#39;s system.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: &#1571;&#1593;&#1608;&#1584; &#1576;&#1616;&#1649;&#1604;&#1604;&#1614;&#1617;&#1607;&#1616; &#1605;&#1616;&#1606;&#1614; &#1649;&#1604;&#1588;&#1614;&#1617;&#1610;&#1618;&#1591;&#1614;&#1600;&#1648;&#1606;&#1616; &#1649;&#1604;&#1585;&#1614;&#1617;&#1580;&#1616;&#1610;&#1605;&#1616; We seek refuge in God from Satan, who was the basic cause for us being here in this world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, in fact, may God make it backfire on Satan and give us happiness in this world and forever</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">through believing in God alone.

I don&#39;t know if you remember. What&#39;s your name, sir?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Douglas: Rashid Dr. Khalifa: What&#39;s your name? Douglas: Rashid.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: I&#39;m serious. We actually forgot. Dr. Khalifa: Rashid?

Dr. Khalifa: He&#39;s a very nervous teacher today.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Sura. You know, a believer appreciates God differently from people who are unaware or who are not strong believers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Imagine sending astronauts into space&rdquo; explains verses of the Quran. We are Astronauts on spaceship Earth. Oxygen levels.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can see here that the title of the Sura is &quot;the Winds.&quot; And we learn from the first few verses that the winds, their main job is to carry clouds and bring bounties.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We need that water. So, in order to appreciate God and these simple words, just imagine yourself sending 10 astronauts to space.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You sending 10 astronauts to space. And you tell them &quot;Okay, you&#39;re gonna be out there for three years. And when you need water, I made an invention in the spaceship so there&#39;ll be these clouds on top of you and they will give you water.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;re sending them into space. And you devise that system that will give them water, clean water.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When they pollute the water they have on the spaceship, it&#39;s gonna... you know, one of the... number one purification processes is distillation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, when they pollute, their own water is gonna evaporate. It&#39;s gonna be pure water and come down again. So, you tell them that, so, to assure them that they will have enough water supply for three years or five years, ten years, whatever</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you&#39;re sending them. Just imagine that. See, God sent this spaceship with five billion astronauts. You and me, we are astronauts.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s right. And God gave us this system. God devised this system where the water evaporates and then comes down by... the wind drive the clouds here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How far are we from the ocean? We&#39;re far from the ocean. But these clouds came to us from the ocean, by the wind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s a traveling system. And that sends down pure water. You appreciate God if you think.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But if you imagine sending ten astronauts in space and you tell them &quot;I&#39;m going to give the exact</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">percentage of oxygen for you to breathe.&quot; Now, in 1967, we were technologically advanced people. In 1967.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But we put three astronauts in a capsule in an atmosphere of 100% oxygen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pure oxygen, right? To breathe. And all it took was a spark.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the three astronauts were combusted. Ed White, Gus Grissom, and Roger Chaffee.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&#39;re not with us today because of that. We were really advanced in science.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But when you put anything in pure oxygen and light a match, everything would be combusted. Everything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everything organic, that is. In fact, this is for chemists.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If any chemist is here, this is the last thing you do to find out if there is, for example, radioactivity in the ashes of anything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You put it in a closed thing there. You fill it with 100% oxygen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you create a spark. And everything will be combusted into ashes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is what happened to the three astronauts. And this is why God didn&#39;t give us 100% oxygen. We have 20% oxygen. The rest is nitrogen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is what they do now when they send astronauts into space.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But we learned the hard way. So, despite our...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, we were sending people to the moon. And we couldn&#39;t give them the correct atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, these few verses here will make us appreciate God if we think of sending our own astronauts into space.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, you know how the oxygen is generated for us. We breathe it and we get out carbon dioxide, which is not good for breathing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, God designed the trees so they will take carbon dioxide and turn it into apples and give us the oxygen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They take the carbon and give us back the oxygen. How do you like that for a system? Can you do that for your astronauts?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You tell your 10 astronauts, you&#39;re gonna be out there for 10 years and you&#39;re gonna breathe out carbon dioxide. So, I&#39;m gonna give you</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a couple of... I invented these plants or something that will take your carbon dioxide, turn it into food for you, and you&#39;ll get the oxygen back.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s what God&#39;s created. And you think it&#39;s all evolution, right?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Are there any questions on these, the winds and the rains?

So, welcome to the group. You notice &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">0:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in the new translation, the word &quot;GOD&quot; is written in &nbsp;bold, big letters. And at the bottom of the page, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on the left side, you see the number 9? This &nbsp;is the number of occurrences of the word &quot;God&quot; on &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">this page. If you count them easily, 1, 2, 3, &nbsp;4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This is the total, the word &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;God&quot; on this page. And on the right side is the &nbsp;total up to this page, from the beginning of the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Quran. The objective of this is to let the reader &nbsp;participate in the mathematical code of the Quran, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">which proves to the person that he is looking at &nbsp;God&#39;s message to him or her. And this is not a &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">human-made book. Muhammad didn&#39;t just invent it &nbsp;and make it up. You are reading God&#39;s message, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and this mathematical code gives you the &nbsp;confidence that God is speaking to you, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">not any human being who&#39;s trying to fool you. &nbsp;The total number of the word God in the Quran, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">as you know, is 2,698, which is a multiple of 19. &nbsp;19 being the common denominator throughout the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Quran. And I&#39;m using just this word as an example. &nbsp;But every letter in the Quran is mathematically &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">coded, mathematically composed, and the whole &nbsp;system is easily superhuman, as all of you know. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is one observation I want to make about &nbsp;the translation.

So, that&#39;s &nbsp;very late in April, or very early in May. It will &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">take six or seven weeks to print, and then we&#39;ll &nbsp;have the Arabic and the complete book with us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.

God is always in their &nbsp;mind, in everything they do, everything they say. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those who believe and lead a righteous life. &quot;For &nbsp;them is happiness in this world.&quot; I&#39;m quoting now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Hadith claims the most miserable are the most righteous. There are categories within Satan&rsquo;s Kingdom and God&rsquo;s Kingdom. Talk of Appreciation i.e &ldquo;the Eyes&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m quoting those verses. Verse 62 of Sura 10. &nbsp;&quot;For them is happiness in this world.&quot; And this &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is God speaking. &quot;and in the Hereafter.&quot; So, this &nbsp;warranty or guarantee from God is repeated 23 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">times in the Quran. Now as you know, Satan tricks &nbsp;the other people who deviate from the Quran and &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they have other sources like Hadith and Sunnah and &nbsp;God knows what, all kinds of sources besides the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Quran. Their number one Hadith goes like this. &quot;The &nbsp;most righteous among you is the most miserable.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is a very famous Hadith. Because Satan &nbsp;knows that he cannot give them happiness.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And actually the Hadith goes on and says &quot;the most &nbsp;miserable are the prophets, and then the saints, &nbsp; and then the believers.&quot; That&#39;s right. So, and this &nbsp;is an authentic Bukhari Hadith. It goes directly &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">against the Quran. The Quran says otherwise. Says &quot;those who believe and lead a righteous life &nbsp; are guaranteed happiness.&quot; I&#39;m gonna go back a &nbsp;little bit again and talk about the title of the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sura, Mutual Blaming. Mutual Blaming is one of &nbsp;the names of the Day of Judgment. It&#39;s called the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Day of Resurrection. It&#39;s called the Day of &nbsp;Judgment. It&#39;s called the Day of Reckoning.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s called the Day of Mutual Blaming. Because this is &nbsp;the day when a lot of people will be blaming each &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">other. &quot;You&#39;re the one who told me this.&quot; &quot;No, you&#39;re &nbsp;the one who told me this.&quot; &quot;You took me out of this &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">place.&quot; &quot;You took me into that place.&quot; So, there&#39;ll be mutual blaming. In fact, the people of &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hell will spend eternity beating each other. And &nbsp;thanking each other for beating each other. &quot;So, if &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you give me 10 kicks, I&#39;ll give you 10 kicks.&quot; &nbsp;Okay. Mutual Blaming. One of the names of the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Day of Judgment. Verse 2 says [64:2] He is the one who created you. Then among you there is the disbeliever and the believer. God is fully seer of everything you do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are only two kinds of people. People in God&#39;s kingdom and people in &nbsp;Satan&#39;s kingdom. There&#39;s nothing else. No other &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">choices. Although there are categories within &nbsp;each section. For example, Satan&#39;s kingdom has the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">disbelievers and the hypocrites. And both of them &nbsp;fall under the bigger category of disbelievers. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Other names for believer and disbeliever is &nbsp;appreciative and unappreciative. These are other &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">names. Appreciative of God or unappreciative. &nbsp;And we&#39;re gonna get to this in Sura 76. Not today. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But these are the other synonyms &nbsp;of believer and disbeliever. Appreciative and &nbsp; unappreciative. Because God gave you a lot of good &nbsp;things in advance. Then, He asked you to show your &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">appreciation. Let us take for example your eyes. &nbsp;Just your eyes. And I&#39;ve shared this with some &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of you before. If you&#39;re walking out in the street &nbsp;and somebody puts a gun to your head. And he says</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;your eyes or five Prayers a day.&quot; What will you do? Not your eyes or your money. You&#39;re gonna say</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;you either give me your eyes or promise me to do &nbsp;five Prayers a day.&quot; What will you choose? If this &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: Five Prayers a day. Dr. Khalifa: If this is real... Dr. Khalifa: That&#39;s right. Easily. Right? So, God &nbsp;gave you your eyes in advance. If you want &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to appreciate them, just close your eyes for a &nbsp;couple of minutes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s something that we take for granted. I hope none of you is color blind. But if you look around and you see the red, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the blue and the green and all these nice colors. &nbsp;God&#39;s people are perfect anyway. You notice. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alhamdu Lillah. Thank God we all have two eyes &nbsp;each. So, God gave you these eyes in advance and He &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said &quot;you do five Prayers a day.&quot; Appreciative and &nbsp;unappreciative. The people who are not worshipping &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God alone are not appreciative. I didn&#39;t mentioned the lungs or the kidneys. Nobody will want to &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">substitute God&#39;s kidneys for the technologically &nbsp;advanced artificial kidneys that they have. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&#39;re small now. They&#39;re only about six feet &nbsp;tall and four feet wide and three feet deep. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And these are the most advanced kidneys. They take &nbsp;the patient blood completely into the machine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">People ask &ldquo;why did God send me here&rdquo;. Dr. Rashad Khalifa explains.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it&#39;s not as good. You should see those people. So, we thank God. He gave you all these things in advance. Number three.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[64:3] He created the heavens and the earth for a specific purpose. &nbsp;Designed you and perfected your design. Then to Him is the final destiny.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Footnote 64:3 says &quot;we &nbsp;are in this world due to God&#39;s immense mercy and &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Most Gracious will to redeem us after we committed &nbsp;the gross blasphemy. See the introduction and</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">appendix 7.&quot; You know, a lot of people say &quot;why did God bring &nbsp;me here? I didn&#39;t wanna come here.&quot; Because they &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">don&#39;t understand why we are here. If they read &nbsp;the Quran, they will know why we are here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they will realize that we committed a gross crime &nbsp;billions of years ago. And God decided to give &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">us a chance to redeem ourselves, to denounce idol &nbsp;worship. But the majority of people insist on idol &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">worship. The vast majority of Christians insist &nbsp;on worshiping Jesus. And the vast majority of &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Muslims insist on worshiping Muhammad. It&#39;s &nbsp;just the human nature. They&#39;re all humans. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the Quran makes that statement in advance. &nbsp;It says &quot;most people, no matter what you do, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">will not believe.&quot; Because God knows these are the &nbsp;creatures who committed that blasphemy billions &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of years ago. And I don&#39;t wanna bore you with &nbsp;repetition of what it is.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then God says that of the minority that will believe, the majority &nbsp;will fall in idol worship. Because God knows...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, this is what brought us here. We did &nbsp;not uphold God&#39;s absolute authority. And this is &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">why we have that tendency to idolize saints and &nbsp;prophets. The vast majority of people fall in that &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">trap. So, He created the heavens and the earth for &nbsp;a specific purpose, which is redeeming those among &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">us who deserve to be redeemed. So, we can go back &nbsp;and join, rejoin God&#39;s kingdom. If we fail, then we&#39;ll &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">be exiled from God&#39;s kingdom, and that is hell. It &nbsp;only makes sense, like I told you at noon today.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you&#39;re a chairman of the board of a company, &nbsp;you don&#39;t want the lazy employees. It will cause &nbsp; the company to lose. And instead of God firing &nbsp;us completely, He said &quot;I&#39;ll give you a chance &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to educate yourselves, redeem yourselves, and then &nbsp;come back to me. This is the specific purpose. God &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">designed you and perfected your design. And the &nbsp;design of the human being is fantastic, and</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we never tired from describing it. Like I was using &nbsp;somebody the other day to give the example. Well, we can &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">use Greg now. See, Greg is scratching his face. Ok. His hand is like this, but it goes like that, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and then it turns and scratches his face. He takes &nbsp;it for granted. But this is quite a design. There &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">are two bones in your arm here that can go &nbsp;around each other, so it can go like this. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, how many times do you take it for granted? You go &nbsp;like this. You don&#39;t even think. God perfected our &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">design. Can you scratch every part of your body? &nbsp;This is God&#39;s design. Your arm is not too short. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Crippled bodies are victims of Satan.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can reach every inch of your body. Not &nbsp;me, but... If I maintain the natural weight, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I will. So, it&#39;s my fault. If there is any flaw &nbsp;in your design, it&#39;s your fault.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Designed you and perfected your design. Anything &nbsp;that goes wrong... This is very important, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">because people will tell you &quot;how about the &nbsp;person who&#39;s crippled?&quot; It&#39;s very important to &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">understand that that person is a victim of Satan. Something, something, they removed themselves from God&#39;s protection, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and that caused Satan&#39;s victimizing them. And &nbsp;the perfect example that we know, and we talked &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">about it before many times, is Rabbi Kushner &nbsp;of Boston. Rabbi Kushner of Boston. His book is &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">full of blasphemies against God, unfortunately. &nbsp;Not all the Jewish people are like that, but he &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is a rabbi, and he should know better. He wrote &nbsp;this book &quot;When Bad Things Happen to Good People&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and he totally misunderstands... He does not &nbsp;understand Satan&#39;s role at all. And he says that &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the bad things happen because God cannot control &nbsp;everything. God is not Omnipotent, according &nbsp; to him. His book is just full of blasphemies. &nbsp;Now, what happened to him... his son was born &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with this progeria disease, rapid aging disease. &nbsp;And in 14 years, he died. So, what happened was, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rabbi Kushner, by blaspheming against God in this &nbsp;manner, he removes himself from God&#39;s protection. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Satan fooled around with the embryo, with &nbsp;his son, when he was inside the mother.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Angels are the best surgeons &ndash; God promises to protect you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the child was born defective. So, whose fault is &nbsp;it? The child was victimized by Satan.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Rabbi Kushner was victimized by Satan, in the same &nbsp;way. Because God guarantees your health through &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the angels, God&#39;s angels. God has some of the best &nbsp;surgeons in the world. If you are to.... anything wrong happens &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in your body, they can go in your body and fix it. &lsquo;Alaykum Al-Salaam. And Satan has the same ability,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">because he was an angel. So, remember that anything, any flaw &nbsp;is a result of Satan&#39;s interference. But when you &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">look around here, this is the basic design &nbsp;of God. &quot;designed you and perfected your &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">design. Then, to Him is the final destiny.&quot; He gave &nbsp;you two eyes. Because some people have accidents, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they lose one eye. So, they have another spare. &nbsp;Even though everyone is perfectly guarded, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">nothing happens against the will of God. And &nbsp;God promises to protect you as long as you &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">are in His domain. He gave us two kidneys in case &nbsp;one of them stops for some reason. And remember, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">two ears and one mouth. I should learn from &nbsp;this and stop talking. And put on the spot here, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">because General Spooner went AWOL. He was supposed &nbsp;to be here talking. He called from Memphis today. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is alright by the way. Okay, verse 3 ends by &nbsp;the statement &quot;to Him is the final destiny.&quot; Okay, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">so every one of us is gonna go back. And if we &nbsp;did our part, we&#39;ll be prepared to join God&#39;s &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">kingdom. If we did not do our part, and we did not &nbsp;develop ourselves, we will not be able to be there &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">physically. God forbid. The people who did not &nbsp;prepare themselves will go to hell on their own &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">volition. God will not put anybody in hell. They &nbsp;will go to hell on their own volition. And we have &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">examples. The bugs. You put the light fixer on and &nbsp;you screw it in very tight, and still the bugs, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they work very hard to work through this thread, &nbsp;and go inside to die. This is how the human beings &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">do. They work very hard to go to hell. So, God &nbsp;gives us lots of examples in this world. Number 4, verse 4,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[64:4] He knows everything in the heavens and the earth.

We just cannot have a complete &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">comprehension of God&#39;s Omnipotence and Power. &nbsp;Look how He created you and the blood pumping &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in your body in a perfect, perfect design. If you sleep &nbsp;in your arm for a couple of hours at night and &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the circulation is not right, you know, you get a nightmare or something to move you. Because the circulation has to be perfect.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He knows everything you conceal and everything you declare.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, if you do your part, God is aware of it. Everything is recorded. &nbsp;Consciousness of God is very important. Wherever &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you go, just remember God is with you. You must &nbsp;be conscious that God is with us here right &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">now. He&#39;s aware of everything we&#39;re doing. He is &nbsp;aware that you are here to study His message. You &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">want to redeem yourself and go back to God, join &nbsp;His kingdom. God is aware of that. And These are heavy &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">verses. Verse number five says,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[64:5] Have you noted those who disbelieved in the past then suffered the consequences of their decision? They incurred a painful retribution.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God is teaching us from the past history. And these are factual observations. We know that Pharaoh drowned in the sea.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We know that. We know that Moses and the believers &nbsp;crossed the Red Sea. There were no bridges then, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">no Golden Gate Bridge. But they crossed the &nbsp;Red Sea from Egypt to Sinai. We know Pharaoh &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Believers go through a purification process but will emerge a Gem. God will take each one of our flaws and &ldquo;polish&rdquo; us. The end of the disbeliever&rsquo;s life always bad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">drowned and his body is full of salt in the Cairo &nbsp;Museum. &quot;Have you noted those who disbelieved in &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the past then suffered the consequences of their &nbsp;decision?&quot; And usually it is the end that counts. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The believers may go through a purification &nbsp;process, a polishing process, like the stone that &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">goes through a lot to become a gem. But there is &nbsp;these machines, these polishing machines that are &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">very severe. So, the believer may go through that, &nbsp;but he or she will emerge like a gem in the end. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we have, we have... all these guarantees will be fulfilled. The &nbsp;purpose of the purification process is just that, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">purification, to make you a perfect human being, &nbsp;a person who does not lie, cheat, trustworthy, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">righteous. Purification. And God will take &nbsp;each one of these at a time and cleanse you &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from it through a polishing process. Remember &nbsp;Jahan&#39;s Khutba on Friday when he didn&#39;t wanna</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">do the push-ups? See, he&#39;s young and he&#39;s &nbsp;going through the polishing process. But he &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">will emerge like a gem. Purification process done &nbsp;by the Master Purifier. But those who disbelieve, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">their end is always bad, always. Their last &nbsp;15 or 20 years are the most miserable years &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of their lives. And the opposite is true &nbsp;with the believers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Nothing happens to you except as a consequence of your works i.e. Dr. Rashad Khalifa talks of his Nephew. We must learn &ldquo;Correlation&rdquo; between a &ldquo;pinch&rdquo; and making a mistake. God&rsquo;s pinches are restorable i.e. loss of money or a headache.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think tonight we&#39;re gonna come to the law that says that &quot;nothing &nbsp;happens to you except in accordance with God&#39;s &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">will.&quot; This is one of the two important laws. The &nbsp;other law says &quot;nothing happens to you except as &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a consequence of something you have done.&quot; These &nbsp;are negative, negative. &quot;Nothing except.&quot; &quot;Nothing happens except &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">as a consequence of your work.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was talking &nbsp;to my nephew this morning in Egypt. And he was &nbsp; telling me that he&#39;s doing everything right and &nbsp;he wonders why he gets some problems. So, I went &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with him through a typical day or something and &nbsp;discovered he doesn&#39;t do the Morning Prayer. Maybe &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">once a week he does the Morning Prayer before &nbsp;sunrise. So, I taught him the law. I said &quot;the law is &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">nothing happens to you except as a consequence &nbsp;of something you have done.&quot; I taught him that &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God loves him and wants him to do the Morning &nbsp;Prayer. This is probably what God is choosing at &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">this time to purify him. Every time he misses the &nbsp;Morning Prayer, he gets a pinch until he does the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">correlation and realizes that God is aware of him and like he&#39;s watching as if he&#39;s the only one on earth. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And whenever he misses the Prayer, he gets the &nbsp;pinch. The correlation is immediate. And this is &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">why we have also the other law that says &quot;worship &nbsp;God in order to attain certainty.&quot; This is how you &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">attain certainty. Because with this immediate &nbsp;correlation, you&#39;re gonna realize that God &nbsp; is watching you as if you&#39;re the only person in &nbsp;the universe. And when you make a mistake, you get &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a pinch. It&#39;s a kind pinch. It hurts, but it gets &nbsp;your attention. It doesn&#39;t hurt permanently. It is &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the kind that is restorable. God&#39;s pinches are all &nbsp;restorable. You don&#39;t lose a finger, for example, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">because you cannot restore that. But you get a &nbsp;pinch that is restorable. You get a headache, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for example, because headaches go away. &nbsp;You lose a few dollars. You can get them back &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">multiplied manifold. So, this verse, number five, &nbsp;reminds us of these two laws, two important laws. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don&#39;t forget them. I think we&#39;re gonna get &nbsp;to the one that says &quot;nothing happens except in &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">accordance with God&#39;s will.&quot; I believe it &nbsp;is in this Sura. Oh, Ok. And the other law says &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;nothing happens to you except as a consequence of &nbsp;your work.&quot; Nothing happens. I mean, it&#39;s quite a &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Following the messenger is following God&rsquo;s instructions.

Number six,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[64:6] This is because their messengers went to them with clear &nbsp;proofs, but they said, &quot;shall we follow humans like us?&quot; They disbelieved and turned away. God does not need them. God is in no need, Praiseworthy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">See, they made a mistake when they said &quot;shall we &nbsp;follow humans like us?&quot; Because the messengers are not</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">are not the ones that are being followed. It is &nbsp;God&#39;s instructions that are being followed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The messenger is one of the people around who is the &nbsp;same as they are, and he himself is required to &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">follow the instructions. So, we&#39;re all following &nbsp;God when we look at God&#39;s teachings and follow them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But here, their ego is an important &nbsp;test. So, we&#39;re told that the painful retribution &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that is in verse five came to these people because &nbsp;their messengers went to them with clear proofs. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, Moses threw the staff, became a serpent &nbsp;in front of Pharaoh and swallowed everything &nbsp; else. He still did not believe. God made the Nile &nbsp;into blood in front of them. They couldn&#39;t drink &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for seven days. And they told Moses &quot;ask your God &nbsp;to give us water again, we will believe.&quot; As soon &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">as it became water again, they said &quot;NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA. We will not believe.&quot; I mean, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">what is this? Frogs, lice, locusts, nine plagues. &nbsp;And every time they said &quot;ask God to relieve this, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and we will believe&quot;, and then they reneged. So, &nbsp;God is fair. When they drowned in the Red Sea, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they deserved that. But God gave them enough &nbsp;warnings.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[64:6] This is because their messengers went to them with clear proofs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this day and age, we &nbsp;have the mathematical code of the Quran, proving &nbsp; this is God&#39;s word. But they still make all kinds &nbsp;of excuses to avoid it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For seven, well, God&#39;s... I will go back to six, God&#39;s proofs are always &nbsp;clear and overwhelming, as we are experiencing &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">right here in this mosque. The mathematical &nbsp;miracle of Quran, as you will see, I&#39;m writing &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it now in appendix one, is just overwhelming. &nbsp;I&#39;m using here just the word God as an example, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and this alone is enough to prove that this is &nbsp;not human made. Because the word God, now here we &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">are in the 20th century, using computers, and we &nbsp;are sophisticated, educated people, three of us, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lisa, Emily, and myself. We&#39;re working on these &nbsp;numbers, the number of the word God. We are not &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">writing them. We&#39;re not inventing anything. We&#39;re &nbsp;just counting them, keeping track of them. And you &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">have no idea how many mistakes we make. Computers &nbsp;and all. So, it makes us appreciate the miracle &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">even more. I was typing a number, 2492, 2492, for &nbsp;example, and I switched the 9 and the 2, make &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it 2429. So, I was off by about 70. And there are &nbsp;many other examples where I was off by one or two, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">but the Quran is perfect. 2698 of them, that &nbsp;is 19 times 142, and if you take the verses, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">wherever you see the word God, for example, &nbsp;in this page we have verse 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and 9. You take these numbers. In the whole Quran, &nbsp;wherever you see the word God, and add them up, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the total is 118123, which is also a multiple of &nbsp;19. And this will be printed on the last page of &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the Quran. This alone proves that this is not &nbsp;human made.

Tomorrow morning, before sunrise, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you&#39;re gonna have two choices to make. You have &nbsp;a decision to make. You&#39;re gonna get up before &nbsp; sunrise and do the Morning Prayer, or you will &nbsp;not. Only two choices. If you force your body &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to get out of bed and do the Morning Prayer, you &nbsp;will grow. Your soul will grow.

It&#39;s actually &nbsp;more than that. I&#39;m just using these numbers of &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">this world. The other choice is that you &nbsp;become a slave of your body and you sleep, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">because your body is telling you &quot;oh, it&#39;s so much &nbsp;fun to be in the pillow.&quot; Your body is telling you &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that. So, if you&#39;re a slave of your body, you&#39;re &nbsp;gonna sleep, and you lose, because the body &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is gonna go to dust.

Also, in Sura 17, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we learn that the differences in the Hereafter &nbsp;will be fantastic, will be great. See, the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">difference between Hani, a child, and his father, &nbsp;is five feet. In this world, five feet. But in the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hereafter, the difference between the people &nbsp;will be like, somebody will be as big as a cat, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and the other will be as big as Phoenix, Arizona, &nbsp;or the state of Arizona. So, the person as big &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">as a cat &quot;you&#39;re gonna ask him, what did he do &nbsp;wrong?&quot; I mean, it&#39;s obvious. The difference will be huge. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">See, we&#39;re really tiny. We are very tiny. An angel &nbsp;can hold the earth in his hand, see, and you can &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">be as big as that. Remember, we were all in the &nbsp;same company, billions of years ago.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, indeed, by my Lord, you will be resurrected and you&#39;ll &nbsp;be held accountable for everything you have done. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is easy for God to do.&quot; In fact, it&#39;s already &nbsp;done. On the Day of Judgment, when God comes to &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">our world, the people will be automatically &nbsp;stratified according to their size or degree &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and development. If you&#39;re strong enough, &nbsp;you&#39;ll be able to stand the presence of God, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and you will enjoy it. You&#39;ll be in Heaven. If you &nbsp;fail to develop yourself, I&#39;m not talking to you, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of course, it&#39;s the people on the street who &nbsp;need to know that. But the people who fail to &nbsp; develop themselves will have to run away from &nbsp;God. They cannot stand the presence of God, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">too much energy. And this is why God is advising us to &nbsp;do the Five Prayers, to fast the month of Ramadan, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">God did not ask for Fujr to annoy us. Rising early Alleviates Depression.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to be charitable, do all this.

Is this right, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Douglas? In the morning. So, it&#39;s not just.... you &nbsp;cannot lengthen the day from the night side. It &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is getting up early in the morning that induces &nbsp;certain chemicals in your head and causes the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">depression or not. There is a direct correlation. &nbsp;Those who study statistics, the correlation is 1.0 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">between sleeping too much and headaches and &nbsp;depression. You sleep more than 8 hours a &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">day, you&#39;re guaranteed to have headaches and &nbsp;maybe depression.

For &nbsp;example, in chapter 41, verse 21, we see God makes &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">everything speak up, makes everything speak up. For example, in 41:11, we see earth and heaven speak. In 23, chapter &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">23:62, the record speaks.

Talk of Various translations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Ok. This is very important to note that the people who do not.... the worshippers who do not observe the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Contact Prayers are anxious. Anxious, I really &nbsp;want a more stronger word than anxious. In Arabic, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">HALU&#39;A is worried, always worried. Nervous and &nbsp;anxious and worried, always worried. A human... huh?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah. Jittery and worried.

I remember &nbsp;my father&#39;s teacher had a debate with some of the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mullahs. And he trapped him into this. He said, &nbsp;&quot;do you worry a lot?&quot; He said &quot;yeah, we&#39;re humans, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we worry.&quot; He said &quot;if something bad happens &nbsp;to you, do you become upset?&quot; He said &quot;yeah, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we&#39;re human beings, we do that.&quot; And then he &nbsp;said... So, I said &quot;well, then you don&#39;t belong &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with the worshippers who observe their Salat prayer because in verse 22, it says,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(70:22) &#1573;&#1616;&#1604;&#1614;&#1617;&#1575; &#1649;&#1604;&#1618;&#1605;&#1615;&#1589;&#1614;&#1604;&#1616;&#1617;&#1610;&#1606;&#1614; Except those who observe the Salat Prayers. So, the lesson &nbsp;is that if you do observe your Contact Prayers, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">this will cool you down. You will not worry, &nbsp;you&#39;ll have nothing to worry about. No fear, &nbsp; no worry. And you will not be despondent when &nbsp;adversity happens. You&#39;ll remember what the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Quran says, that you may dislike something which &nbsp;is good for you. You may not get the job that you &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">want, but God knows it is not good for you, and &nbsp;you accept that. So, you will not be despondent, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you will not be miserable, because you didn&#39;t make &nbsp;it in the job interview. So, then we have a bunch of</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">traits of the believers. They always observe &nbsp;their Contact Prayers, verse 23. 24,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A specific portion, 2.5% of their net income is set aside &nbsp;for the poor and the needy, 25. 26,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[70:26] They believe in the Day of Judgment. These are all traits of the believers. 27,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[70:27] They reverence their Lord&#39;s requital. They worry about it. In other words, &nbsp;they don&#39;t want it. They know how bad it is, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">just making God angry. God doesn&#39;t get angry, by &nbsp;the way, but, I mean, violating His commandments. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">27, eh, 28, [70:28] Their Lord&#39;s requital is not taken for granted. In other words, when you look at this, you&#39;ll be &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">severe against yourself. You will not be lax. You &nbsp;will judge yourself according to these criteria, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and make sure that you&#39;re a believer. You &nbsp;will be strict with yourself. Number 29,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[70:29] They keep their chastity. So, I mean, you look &nbsp;at this verse 29, and you keep your chastity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You will not be lax or careless. Keeping the chastity &nbsp;is something that is unusual in this country, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">because the society evolved so much in the last &nbsp;few decades. Maybe, I should get you the piece of &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">paper that Phil handed me. Just one second. &nbsp;It&#39;s appropriate to this. Let me. It&#39;s for all those &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">born before 1945, which probably includes me &nbsp;only. And...Okay, but here it says &quot;we were certainly &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">not before the difference between the sexes was &nbsp;discovered. But we were surely before the sex &nbsp; changed. We may do with what we have. And we were &nbsp;the last generation that was so dumb as to think &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you needed a husband to have a baby.&quot; No wonder we &nbsp;are so confused, and there is such a generation &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">gap. But we survived, okay. I think there are &nbsp;some other points here that along the line that &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;we were the last generation that was so dumb as &nbsp;to think you needed a husband to have a baby.&quot; So, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in other words, what happened in the last few &nbsp;decades is really very harmful to the people. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we see what happened with AIDS, the spread &nbsp;of venereal diseases, lesbian mothers, things &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that those who were born before 1945 never heard of these &nbsp;things. But verse 29, the believers do not take it &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">lightly, 29. I&#39;m writing an appendix on chastity &nbsp;and virginity for our children. Our children &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">better be different from the other children. It &nbsp;is your responsibility to teach your children for &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">their own good that they must be virgin on their &nbsp;wedding night. And I&#39;m talking about boys and &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">girls. And I&#39;m going to show in the appendix how &nbsp;the happiness of your children depends on that. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The price is just too high if they don&#39;t follow &nbsp;this verse, this very short verse, 29, they keep &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[70:29] They keep their chastity. The price is really too high. Now, &nbsp;even from the physiological and the physical point &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of view, the boys and the girls, when they mature &nbsp;first and they&#39;re ready for... they&#39;re not ready. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, physiologically, they may have their &nbsp;menstruation, or they may... the voice may change, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the boy&#39;s voice may change, but physiologically &nbsp;and anatomically, they are not really ready for &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sex. But in this country, they delve into sex &nbsp;without being ready, and they hurt themselves, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and they pay the price when they grow up. This is &nbsp;from the purely physical and physiological point &nbsp; of view. But from the practical point of view, &nbsp;God sees to it that those who violate this... &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cause you know, our boys and girls must be taught not to &nbsp;violate this. That they must keep their chastity, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">because when they do that, they pay from their &nbsp;happiness. They will not have a happy marriage. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They will not have a happy life. And, mind you, &nbsp;it is not easy. You must teach them that it is &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">not easy to keep your chastity, especially in a &nbsp;society like this. Joe Sobran is a reporter with &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the Los Angeles Times, and he had a wonderful &nbsp;commentary only yesterday, or the day before. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He says &quot;these boys, they go out and they have &nbsp;sex as if there are no consequences. But the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">consequences are abortions, dangerous things &nbsp;that happen to... and children who these boys have no intention &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of raising them or supporting them. They create a &nbsp;lot of misery.&quot; That was Joe Sobran&#39;s commentary, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and he is not a Muslim. But here we are reading &nbsp;the Quran, and God knows what is good for us. &nbsp; And He is telling us that the believers must &nbsp;keep their chastity. You know, all of you are young, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and you have children who are growing, and I want &nbsp;to repeat and emphasize, and re-emphasize that it is &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">your responsibility. If you just do your part, God &nbsp;will do the other part. You cannot just leave them &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to the world out there. You have to do your part &nbsp;by teaching them what the Quran is saying, what &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God is saying. Because if you really love them, &nbsp;you want them to be happy when they grow up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And one source of misery will be to break these laws. &nbsp;They are not physiologically ready. They&#39;ll be &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">breaking God&#39;s law, and the price is too high. And &nbsp;I know you do want them to be happy. So, I am going &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to write this appendix in detail, and you can use &nbsp;it. Ok. Use me to give them these instructions. It is &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">very difficult to be a father or a mother, and you &nbsp;talk to children about sex. It&#39;s kind of awkward. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But if you use the Quran, tell them &quot;this is what &nbsp;God says. Here is the appendix. Read it.&quot; And God &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">will help you, and will protect them. So, and emphasize to them that it is not easy. You must &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">exert, tell them they have to exert a lot of control. Because the temptation is so great out there. And you are helping them this &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">way when you tell them &quot;it is not easy. But you &nbsp;must exert for your own happiness and your own good, you must exert a lot of control. You must &nbsp;resist.&quot; You know, they have a big thing saying</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;say no to drugs.&quot; But you never see &quot;say &nbsp;no to sex.&quot; Even though it is disastrous. Is there?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, Subhan Allah. Ok.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, this is a shock. A woman: If you have 20 hours, they say, you know &quot;use contraceptive whenever (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Because this, I think it was Valentine&#39;s Day at the university, and they &nbsp;distributed free condoms. It&#39;s like telling them</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;go have sex&quot;, you know. They don&#39;t realize what they&#39;re doing, and how much unhappiness they&#39;re</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">causing to these kids. But this is good news. &nbsp;Now, God is forcing. God says in Sura 41 verse 53, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that God will show them His signs in the &nbsp;horizons and within themselves until they &nbsp; realize that this is the truth. This is what is good &nbsp;for us. There is a big campaign in the country &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">against alcohol. They don&#39;t do it because God &nbsp;said so. But they are forced by the disasters, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the social disasters, and the broken families, &nbsp;and the depression that is caused by alcohol, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the hangovers and headaches, diseases. Now, the &nbsp;book, there&#39;s a book in the market, new book, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that is called &quot;You Are What You Drink.&quot; I&#39;ve &nbsp;mentioned it before. And it lists unbelievable &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">disastrous health problems from alcohol. Because &nbsp;it dissolves your brain. I mean, I&#39;m talking &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">about cancer, blood pressure, heart disease. Established, scientifically established.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: Liver disease. Dr. Khalifa: Liver disease, of course, it&#39;s known long time ago. And the same is happening with violating this verse 29, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[70:29] They keep their chastity. The same thing is &nbsp;happening. There are unheard of diseases coming out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Made aware of AIDS affecting Females.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">AIDS is one of them. Uncurable. Skin cancer exposure. You&#39;re telling me that now, the... Naghmeh, you&#39;re telling me now the females &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">have a disease that is similar to AIDS. I heard &nbsp;about it a couple of weeks ago. Do you wanna tell us more? A woman: There&#39;s a cancer (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Young girls who are sexually active. Because they are not physiologically, they&#39;re not physiologically &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ready. It takes maybe 10 years after the voice in &nbsp;the boy changes and the menstruation of the girl, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">maybe 10 years to really be ready to be pregnant &nbsp;and to be in a marriage relationship. So, God &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">knows, God created us and knows what is good for &nbsp;us. So, if you think I spend too much time on this,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it&#39;s deliberate. Because you have a lot of &nbsp;responsibility. There are lots of beautiful, &nbsp; wonderful kids running around here. And they must &nbsp;be protected. Like I said &quot;don&#39;t worry.&quot; You just &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">do your part. And you must know that your children &nbsp;are in God&#39;s hand. You can&#39;t be with them every &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">time. But God chaperones your children. You&#39;re &nbsp;a person. You&#39;re a person of God. And you must &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">have that confidence. You must know that God is &nbsp;with your children wherever they go. If they&#39;re &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">riding a bicycle in the middle of the street, or &nbsp;they&#39;re out with other people subjected to all the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">temptations of this society. Don&#39;t worry. Drugs or &nbsp;sex or accidents. Your children are in God&#39;s hand &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and you must have that confidence. And being the &nbsp;oldest of you, I&#39;ve raised two kids. I know that. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I know. I&#39;m speaking from experience. They&#39;ve &nbsp;seen how much God&#39;s protection is marvelous. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they&#39;ve seen how you just do your part and God &nbsp;will do His part in the most magnificent ways. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I don&#39;t have relations with anybody else. In &nbsp;fact, this is repeated in verse 30. It says</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[70:30] (They have relations) only with their spouses, or what is legally theirs&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, there&#39;s a lot at stake. It is just not worth it violating these laws. These are very harsh. The punishment is very harsh. It seems &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">out of proportion. So, if you want to test it, go &nbsp;ahead. You&#39;re gonna pay through the nose. If,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">if you want to abide by God&#39;s law, then you attain a &nbsp;lot of happiness and you avoid lots of problems. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay. Any questions?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right. They&#39;re being selfish, like the fellow who donated a million dollars to the cancer centre but it had to be announced over the microphone in the stadium. This is showing &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">off and he&#39;s doing it for selfish reasons. Maybe. &nbsp;Maybe. I mean, he has to be a believer in God to &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">give things secretly. But the criterion is whether &nbsp;the person is cutting a portion of his money and &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">giving it to the poor or not. The minimum is &nbsp;2.5%. If the person is giving away at least 2.5% &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of his or her money to the poor, then they&#39;re alright. Farhad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes. This is verse 30.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes. OR is very important. Yes. This is...The Quran is so accurate &nbsp;that you have to pay attention to what Farhad</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is just saying. OR or AND. There&#39;s a verse that &nbsp;says you shall observe Hajj and Umrah. And I have &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">translated it, maybe even in the old translation, &nbsp;OR Umrah. But we&#39;re supposed to observe, in &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pilgrimage, there are two things you must observe. &nbsp;Hajj and Umrah. They must be done. So, this is a &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">similar... The difference is just a dash. WA or AW. It&#39;s &nbsp;the difference. You really have to pay attention to these things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Yes, here, if you have spouses, you don&#39;t have legally. Dr. Khalifa: Right. See, because you either &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">got married or either got together without the &nbsp;benefit of marriage. I don&#39;t wanna tell you that &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">joke again. The guy in Africa who wanted to know the secret of happy marriage. And someone said &quot;what is marriage?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, there are places in the world where there is no marriage. Edip: What does legally mean?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, &quot;legally&quot; means that there may be societies where when the people reach the age of 21, they are actually &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">engaged at the time of birth, in some of those &nbsp;societies. They had a boy in the family and said, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;this will be for my daughter.&quot; The tribe chief &nbsp;or something. Because the daughter is not born yet, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">maybe. But these are political connections. So, when they reach 21, they ship the boy and the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">girl into their new house and they become husband &nbsp;and wife, forever. She is legally his and he is &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">legally hers. But there was no marriage ceremony &nbsp;or no such thing as marriage. So, the Quran must &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">cover all situations. They legally belong to &nbsp;each other. In this country, the common law &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">marriages are legal as far as God is concerned. &nbsp;There are two people who decided to live together &nbsp; forever and raise a family. The intention is for &nbsp;being together forever. They don&#39;t go through the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">state and the papers and the priest or the Justice &nbsp;of the Peace or anything. But they live together &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">forever. And that&#39;s legal as far as God is concerned.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: In many places like psychiatric hospitals and (unintelligible), the adolescents have the most serious emotional problems. (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Typically, they&#39;re children of parents who &nbsp;were illicit. They engaged in a lot of illicit &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sexual activity. They committed adultery. A lot of &nbsp;these young people, they don&#39;t have any sense of</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">genuine love or affection. They, in fact, even at times, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">express hatred and resentment toward their &nbsp;parents. Because they can&#39;t see their parents &nbsp; loving each other. These are the ones that are, &nbsp;in fact, the most serious.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I haven&#39;t, God knows, I haven&#39;t come in contact with a single case of &nbsp;an extremely serious emotional problems.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, this type of thing that is not included sometimes in &nbsp;adultery or, you know, disregard for marriage. (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: By the way, I must clarify that when I talk about &nbsp;problems in marriage, there are all those &nbsp; problems in marriage. But for people who &nbsp;keep their chastity until their marriage, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they will have the regular problems of bickering &nbsp;over the budget and what to be spent where and &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">which house to pick out and which room should &nbsp;be the living room and which room should be... &nbsp; These are normal problems. I&#39;m talking about &nbsp;serious problems that are the price of the improper marriage.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: You just mentioned that parents (unintelligible) children (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&#39;s a verse in Sura 4, verse 19, is Quran saying that, you know, it&#39;s commandment &quot;They can&#39;t do that. They can&#39;t get in here unless quiet&quot;?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: No, this is inheritance of the things that the wife &nbsp;possessed. It is not inheriting the person. I,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think I clarified this in the new translation. &nbsp;&quot;You shall not inherit your wife&#39;s forcibly&quot; means &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you cannot force her to write a will giving you &nbsp;everything, giving the husband everything. That&#39;s &nbsp; what it means. But arranged marriages are done all &nbsp;over the world. And a lot of them are very successful. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, this is prohibited in the Quran. Marriage &nbsp;against anybody&#39;s will is prohibited in the Quran &nbsp; anyway. So, this...If a man inherits the wife in the sense &nbsp;that you&#39;re saying, and she&#39;s happy and he&#39;s &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">happy and they get married, fine.

Pardon?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speak slowly. A woman: There are quite a few societies... Dr. Khalifa: Yes. There are a few societies there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Actually, in &nbsp;this society, you find everything here in this society.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Any other questions?

The intention &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">must be forever. They may break up next month &nbsp;or next year, but if the intention was they&#39;re &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">getting together forever, then it&#39;s okay.

But I think they don&#39;t want that they have responsibility.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And maybe they live &nbsp;for 50 years or more than that. Years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Like I said, if the intention was that they live together forever, then it&#39;s perfectly alright. Yeah. Right. Some &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: Some people get married (unintelligible) and they don&#39;t wanna (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Yeah. Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: People&#39;s intention.

Yeah, the Quran consistently &nbsp;talks about marriage and making it official and &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">everything. Yes, but I&#39;m talking about generally, &nbsp;in this country, for people who never saw the &nbsp; Quran, never came across the Quran. Dr. Sabahi: Ok, that&#39;s what I wanna...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Marriage is a very organized institution, according to the Quran, because God tells exactly who we can &nbsp;marry and who we cannot marry. And it&#39;s an elaborate &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and divine institution that is very organized, yes.

Dr. Sabahi: Which is something that I wanted... Dr. Khalifa: We&#39;re going against the Quran.

And they enjoy every minute of it. Believers &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">are very hard workers and the most honest workers. &nbsp;And they are the best producers. And they enjoy &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">every second of it. They&#39;re not lazy. God doesn&#39;t &nbsp;want the lazies. He wants people on the ball in &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His kingdom. It was very good. Sura 16 says &quot;the &nbsp;rich believer is better than the poor believer.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Edip wanted me to change this for possible &nbsp;misunderstandings. But I did not, because God &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">meant that. It says &quot;the rich believer and the poor &nbsp;believer, both are believers.&quot; Both are equally &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">believing. But one of them is able to do things, &nbsp;is able to give to charity, and able to further &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the cause of God and spread the word of God and &nbsp;do things that will make a difference. So, this is a motivation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Is it also (unintelligible) Edip: Allah. Dr. Khalifa: Yes, there are authorized printings &nbsp;and they are the closest to the truth. They have</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">one of the mistakes in them. There are three mistakes in them, in the authorized versions of the Quran printed in &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saudi Arabia or Egypt. Avoid the ones printed in Iran. They misspelled them and messed them up. You &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Sabahi: Even the verses, the numbering of the verses? Dr. Khalifa: That&#39;s possible, but I know that they &quot;simplified&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the Quranic Arabic and they wrote it in the modern... Edip: In Turkey also. Dr. Khalifa: Also in Turkey? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Yes, misspelled. Dr. Khalifa: uh-oh. Yeah. Dr. Khalifa: The first Quran ever in history &nbsp;that is the way God wanted it to be printed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From here, come out of here the next few weeks, IN SHAA ALLAH.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Farhad? Farhad: You mentioned about Persian translation. Another, another translation, its introduction in Persian language. Another translation is in &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Arabic. Translating into Persian is convenient &nbsp;because they use it a lot. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Well, I have good news for you. There is a Farsi translation being done now from my translation. So, we should &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">have it in a year or so, IN SHAA ALLAH. We have &nbsp;authorized Farsi translation. No. Susan Ray? No. It&#39;s done by &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Behrooz. You meet Behrooz? Behrooz Mofidi Shirazi. &nbsp;He&#39;s doing this. He&#39;s going very fast. A man: M&atilde; Sh&atilde; All&atilde;h.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Martha, did you say something?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: You are not reading your Muslim Perspective (unintelligible). You are not reading your Muslim Perspective.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:29:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Martha: Maybe. Dr. Khalifa: Not maybe. You are not reading your Muslim Perspective. It&#39;s right there. It&#39;s the answer to your question. &nbsp;Yes. It&#39;s perfect answer to your question in detail. So, go &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:29:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">read it. Now. Any other questions? While Martha is &nbsp;reading the answer to her question.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:29:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Can you, can you what? &nbsp;What was, what did she say now?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:29:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: Me? I said, any other questions &nbsp;that Rashad can avoid tonight by telling us to read them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:29:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: (unintelligible). That&#39;s actually very efficient, especially since it&#39;s five o&#39;clock at night. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:29:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: It only takes a &nbsp;minute, but it answers your question perfectly. &nbsp; The answer is &quot;yes.&quot; The Prophet Muhammad was given &nbsp;specific instructions. Every time Gabriel released &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:30:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Quran from Muhammad&#39;s soul to Muhammad&#39;s memory, &nbsp;he gave him instructions as to where these three &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:30:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">or four verses belong. And he wrote down those &nbsp;verses and he put the instructions next to them. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:30:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, when he died, he left the complete Quran, &nbsp;but not in the order that God wanted for the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:30:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">world. He left the Quran with instructions on &nbsp;the side as to which Sura goes after what Sura &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:30:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and which verse goes after which verse. Martha: (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:30:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Exactly. They followed &nbsp;the instructions. They put the Quran together, but &nbsp; then Satan tricked them into adding two verses. &nbsp;And that was during Uthman&#39;s time. And this &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:30:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">triggered the war between Ali and his family &nbsp;and the Umayyads. Martha: If that&#39;s the thing that you&#39;re referring to, I read that part. The part about Ali and his family. I&#39;ve read that part. Dr. Khalifa: Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:30:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: There were 50 years of &nbsp; bitter war, but unfortunately, the Umayyads won. &nbsp;So, we got their version. We didn&#39;t get the version of the believers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:31:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: Did Gabriel come down from the sky to Prophet Muhammad? Dr. Khalifa: No.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:31:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: He was an angel. No, he didn&#39;t see him &nbsp; A woman: Did he saw him? Dr. Khalifa: No, he didn&#39;t see him as an angel.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:31:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: Did he just dream him? Dr. Khalifa: No, no, no, he didn&#39;t dream. Gabriel &nbsp;comes and takes and becomes part of Muhammad&#39;s &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:31:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">body and releases the... Gabriel built a &nbsp;connection between Muhammad&#39;s soul and Muhammad&#39;s &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:31:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">physical body. He didn&#39;t need to see him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:31:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: So, I mean like did he talk to them? Dr. Khalifa: No, not like that. When... the possession, you lose... In the possession, you lose your </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:31:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">identity completely. If you are possessed by an &nbsp;angel or a demon or whatever, Naghmeh disappears &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:32:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and the other entity takes over completely. And &nbsp;you have no consciousness at all. But Muhammad was</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:32:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fully conscious. He just had these words come to &nbsp;him and he would write down the verses. It comes &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:32:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to his memory. It&#39;s just like you&#39;re remembering &nbsp;something. You remember that you took a final &nbsp; exam three days ago, and the questions were this, &nbsp;this, and this, and you can write them down. So,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:32:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: this is how he received it. A woman: But he knew that all &nbsp;along it was a spiritual thing. Dr. Khalifa: Oh, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:32:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Ok. Well, whatever your dearest wish is, turn to God &nbsp;and ask him for it. The best wish being to stay &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:32:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on the right path. Al-F&atilde;tehah.

Actually, Lisa sent her to tell me that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">0:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, here I am. First of all, we welcome a new member to our masjid.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">0:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This person here.

Direction of Qibla.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before I start, there is also one more point that I wanted to mention.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thanks to our Iranian brothers and sisters. There is a little bit of confusion now about your arms, what to do with your arms when you pray.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Keep them like this and put them straight down. I would like to establish first, once and for all, that it doesn&#39;t make any difference,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">whether you go like this or put your hands down. But generally, what I do is I follow what the Imam is doing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The person in the front, whatever the person in front is doing, I do what he&#39;s doing. And I recommend that for you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">IN SHAA ALLAH, we&#39;ll be doing Sura 90, The Town.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And whatever we can afterwards. At 8:30, the children will practice on us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, they&#39;ll be singing at the conference. So, we&#39;ll give them maybe 20 minutes, 20 minutes to 9.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">20 minutes enough? 20 minutes to practice a new song on us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It should be enjoyable, IN SHAA ALLAH.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sura 90, The Town.

So, that&#39;s the whole Sura.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I go back to the beginning, swearing. God usually starts many of these short Suras with a profound statement.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this town, meaning Mecca, is profound. Because God made it sacred by putting His shrine there</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to serve as the focal point. or a point of organization for all believers around the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we stand in Prayer, we don&#39;t fight as to which direction we should face.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God already decided for us that we&#39;re gonna face the direction of Mecca. So, every believer, every Muslim around the world is praying and facing that point.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the first verse is simply a profound statement, as in many other Suras.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it is the town where the Prophet Muhammad lived from whom this Quran was revealed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;The begetting and the begotten&quot; is a profound statement again. All these profound statements precede an important proclamation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The begetting and the begotten, this is a profound fact of life.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Take for example birds. The bird laying an egg.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The egg has been fertilized by two parents, through two parents.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One half, a reproductive cell is half a normal cell. One reproductive cell from the male and one half, the other half comes from the female.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They combine to form an embryo. In birds, the egg is laid, it is fertilized.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then, the fact that the birds sit on the eggs, you know they take turns, the male and female in most species.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Taking turns sitting on the egg. Why do they do that? Who taught them to do that?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And what&#39;s happening inside that shell, the egg?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a period of time, that it is becoming obvious more and more that it&#39;s a multiple of 7. 21 days in some birds.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">21, 7 times 3. The human fetus now is in the mother&#39;s womb 266 days.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is now established scientifically. 266, not 265. 266 and that&#39;s 19 times 2 times 7.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s still a multiple of 7.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gestation period, is it called the gestation period? Is that the period inside the womb?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ok. In many other species, I know it is a multiple of 7, but I&#39;m being distracted now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, &quot;the begetting and the begotten&quot; is a profound statement.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After 21 days, the bird inside breaks through the shell and comes out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, they&#39;re walking around. If they&#39;re ducks, they go in the water and they swim. You know, as if they&#39;ve been here forever.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As if they know everything. Walking around, following their mother in the water.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can go to a random spot and see them. They just came out of the egg. And they&#39;re full of wisdom, you know, just following the mother wherever she goes. And sometimes they go independently and pick at something in the water.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Created the human being to work hard to redeem himself&rdquo; explained.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they&#39;re identical to their parents. With beaks and eyes.

Then, it will be three prayers a day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, you will do the Morning Prayer before sunrise and you will enjoy it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The ideal situation is to do the five Prayers with the Morning Prayer done before sunrise.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Also, God tells us in the Quran that we cannot do it every day.

Then, if there is time for anything else, we will do that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is why the verse that says &quot;most of those who believe, fall in idol worship.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because when you give priority to anything else, that&#39;s your idol.

And I don&#39;t want you to feel guilty about that either.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because God Himself in the Quran gives you, knows what&#39;s in your heart, and gives you excuses.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But generally in your life, you&#39;re giving priority to God and your duties towards God,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">which are actually a gift from God to you.

Dr. Khalifa: 29:17.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lydia: [29:17] &quot;What you idolize besides GOD are idols from your creation; you.&quot; Whatever idols you set up possess no provisions for you.

That tongue is an incredible thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We cannot eat without it, actually. Because it keeps the food under the grinders, those things, your teeth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The tongue pushes it. You confuse the tongue sometimes if you eat on both sides.

Just say the word &quot;talk&quot; and you can see where your tongue moves from up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because the T, when you say T, your tongue is up. &quot;Talk&quot;, your tongue goes down.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You cannot talk without your tongue.

Dr. Khalifa: But the definition in 9 and in 20, same, same description. &quot;A numerically structured book.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The wicked will call it &quot;tales from the past&quot;, and the righteous will witness it.

M&atilde; Sh&atilde; All&atilde;h. Yes. Edip: It solves all things, M&atilde; Sh&atilde; All&atilde;h.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: It&#39;s the same book, but also this ties in with the verses that you know, where it says that the Quran increases their wickedness.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or in other places, the Quran causes them to plunge deeper in disbelief.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Their book, they record also in Quran, Rashad. Quran describes all offenses and their punishment.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Edip: This is their book, our book, also. Yes. Dr. Khalifa: Exactly. Yes. Dr. Khalifa: Yes, go ahead.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: No. Dr. Khalifa: But it necessarily refers to the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: No, no, necessarily refers to Quran, yes. Edip: M&atilde; Sh&atilde; All&atilde;h. Yes. Good.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because there is difference. Only difference, righteous people can understand this. The other will say &quot;tales from the past.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: You know how the disbelievers say &quot;the Quran is full of Hell and fire and brimstone?&quot; Well, that&#39;s what they see.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it is, as you know, half and half. So, it depends on which half you see.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: M&atilde; Sh&atilde; All&atilde;h. Dr. Khalifa: Oh, we better quit.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: And let&#39;s go on. I have another.... Edip: No, no, no.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: On this Sura, verse 29, they used to laugh at believers, but now, do they laugh at us, Rashad?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Sure do. Edip: They must be more crazy. They do not laugh too much.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is interesting. Dr. Khalifa: Yes, they do laugh at the believers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Ok. Let&#39;s go.

This is a clue that it&#39;s just a... the lesson to learn from it as a history, as a historical event.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">0:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The thing that happened during the Prophet&#39;s time. Because they needed those rules also in those days, for a few hundred years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">0:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That these rules apply, applicable to war specifically. In our case, we derive the general principles.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">0:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right? Why would women or men secretly do this? A man: Well, I&#39;m just saying, it would be like, first of all, (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">0:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saying, you know, (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: No, okay, I understand now what you&#39;re saying. See, verse 12 is the testing process.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">0:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is how you test them. This is the title of the Sura. Tested woman.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">0:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, if a woman comes and joins the believers in war, this is how you test them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">0:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You make them pledge that they will not idolize... where is it? Never set up idols besides God, nor steal, nor commit adultery,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">nor kill their children, nor invent any falsehood. Nor disobey the Prophet&#39;s righteous orders.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this was the testing process. Which criteria? How do you test them? This is how you test them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Do you pledge you&#39;ll never set up idols beside God?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Do you pledge you&#39;ll worship God alone?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; (unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is how we decide not to send them back to disbelievers in the case of war.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Philip? Philip: I think I got my answer. Dr. Khalifa: I&#39;m glad you brought that up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is a very important statement because it says &quot;o, you prophet...&quot; And as you know, the Sunnis claim that you must obey the Prophet, whatever he says.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This tells us that not all his orders should be obeyed, only his righteous orders.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or the good things that he says. That he can say wrong things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I have this in the book Quran, Hadith and Islam. It is one of the strongest proofs against Hadith and Sunnah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Was that your question? A woman: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: Very good point. I wanted to test this, but unless it came out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is, it is Sura 61.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: The Column A woman: The Column A woman: In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[61:1] Glorifying GOD is everything in the heavens and the earth. He is the Almighty, Most Wise.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[61:2] O you who believe, why do you utter what you do not do yourself? What? Dr. Khalifa: It&#39;s like the invention of Hadith.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the list of prohibitions and lies about God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What&#39;s more, the fellow who came to save me, his wife, you could see only her glasses.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was completely covered. And she would not utter a voice because they teach them that the voice is like getting naked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tyrannical dress code for woman.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s what they teach them. So, she just couldn&#39;t talk.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes. Completely covered. It was hot on that day. It was 95 or something outside.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is really mistreatment. So, this is inventing lies because her husband told her that this is the way you&#39;re supposed to dress.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Who is more evil than one who invents lies about God?&quot; And he&#39;s telling her &quot;God tells you this is the way you&#39;re supposed to dress.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it&#39;s unfair. It&#39;s so unfair.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: Okay. Verse 8. Dr. Khalifa: Right. Go ahead.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The miracle of the Quran is coming out. John. John: God is mentioning the number 19.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of the greatest miracles in the Quran. And they can speak the language that the Quran was revealed in their own language. They can&#39;t see it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Yeah. They were stuck in the first letter of the Qur&#39;an. B, B, B, B, B, B</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">John: Ba Dr. Khalifa: They didn&#39;t go to the S. And while stuck in the B,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God put (unintelligible) them under their feet and turned the miracle into numbers, completely.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, now they&#39;re stunned. They really are. They didn&#39;t know what to do. They&#39;re completely silent.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not a sound. Cause it&#39;s utter silence. After all these numbers came out at this time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is a perfect example of God perfecting His light. Also, it has to do with verse 9.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because I assure you the whole world will be Muslim in about 50 years. Because of the mathematical facts that are coming out of the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, as pioneers, you better familiarize yourself with these physical facts.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You see these numbers of the verses in the... Look at the page. Page 396, for example. You see verses 1 to 14.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In one of the mathematical miracles of the Quran, you put these numbers 1, 2, 3 next to each other.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Somewhere in the line. These numbers put next to each other at the very...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They complete number is a multiple of 19. The number of digits themselves is a multiple of 19.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, these are the factors that will make Islam prevail over all religions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just give the America 50 years and the whole world will be Muslims. I&#39;m talking about true Muslims.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this journalist keeps writing that these are the true right Muslims.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She repeated it so many times in the newspaper. We didn&#39;t tell her that. She just did it on her own.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No. She just invented the name on her own.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: No, because Muhammad is a messenger, too. A prophet and a messenger. But more important is that God didn&#39;t say whose name is Muhammad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Why? Dr. Khalifa: Why? Dr. Khalifa: Because Muhammad&#39;s name is mentioned in there. A man: This is referring to you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: You have to look up the mathematics in the appendix. It will be coming in the new translation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because there are many mathematical relations here. There&#39;s just no time to mention all of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they will be detailed in appendix 2 of the new translation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah, verse 13 is telling us that you don&#39;t have to wait for the Day of Judgment to enjoy the benefits.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God&rsquo;s protection, Invisible Giants, &ldquo;Scheming against you&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can enjoy the benefits now. You have a perfect life now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guaranteed victory, health, wealth, here, in this life.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s very important. And I think, again, we&#39;re not speculating. We&#39;re living this experience.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We know that I published all over the Muslim world that Hadith is satanic innovations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I have it printed here since 1982, in the Brown Book that is widely distributed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s been summarized in many newspapers and criticized and reviewed. But what happened to Salman Rushdie didn&#39;t happen to me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because he&#39;s... You see, he&#39;s in hiding. He&#39;s afraid. He has all these people up in arms.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he didn&#39;t say half as much as I did. So, but, I mean, we live these experiences, because God&#39;s Word is true.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How do you explain that? Except by the Word of God. We have to thank God, Alhamdu Lillah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You don&#39;t (unintelligible) any ideas. However, it doesn&#39;t matter, even if you get ideas.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Remember that you have an invisible giant standing next to you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it&#39;s not just a giant. It&#39;s a giant who can hold the whole earth in one hand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, if somebody&#39;s plotting against you in Stockholm, Sweden, your giant will be there</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">taking care of them, just as they plot and scheme. It is true, you better believe it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because it&#39;s mathematically proven in the Quran. And this is the importance of verse 13.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We&#39;re told that you do your part. And your part in 11 is you believe in God and His Messenger and struggle in the cause of God with your properties and your lives.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is your part. Getting up for the Morning Prayer before sunrise, this is striving.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tests explained i.e. Job.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You dedicate, you devote yourself to God. That&#39;s your part.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, God&#39;s part is overwhelmingly far better than our part.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because God will give you eternal happiness. And then verse 13 tells you &quot;this begins here and now.&quot; Now or forever.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Back to verse 14. No, that&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about. That&#39;s not what this verse is talking about.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It happens automatically. All your resources, everything will be dedicated to God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What happened with Job was Satan said that if You take Job&#39;s properties, he will blaspheme against You.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Job and Solomon are mentioned together as the two extremes of testing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And again, this is something that doesn&#39;t happen now. It&#39;s a new era. But it&#39;s an example of testing and believing in God under all circumstances.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Being devoted to God under all circumstances. So, striving with your life and your properties in the cause of God, it&#39;s something that happens automatically.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Upon understanding who God is and why you are here and where the provisions come from.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They belong to God anyway. It&#39;s an extreme example of tests that was OK in those days.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was restored anyway. Everything was restored and twice as much.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is to make us understand when we lose something small.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As much. But everything will be restored and twice as much.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because Satan may say &quot;Robert will blaspheme if you destroy his car against You.&quot;&#39;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And God will tell Satan &quot;OK, go get his RX-7, but you cannot touch him.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, he took your RX-7, but he couldn&#39;t touch you. That was a miracle, by the way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, Robert&#39;s car was forced under a truck. And after he left the car, he wondered how he was alive in there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was really miraculous. And this is a perfect example. So, what happened to you is what happened to Job.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, of course, God gave you a better car later on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah, you think how it came to you? It has to be God who gave you that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s a perfect example.

And when I watched that program, I said &quot;I wish Rashad was there to explain this thing&quot; because</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">there was one moment where one professor of biology from University of California sat in front of this group.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this group of Institute of Creation Research was represented by one PhD also in biochemistry,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">graduated from the same school Rashad graduated from, University of California, Riverside. So, it was very interesting, but</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he brought the argument up to the point that he couldn&#39;t further it. But if he had heard that, what Rashad gave in the Khutba, that would be very interesting.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because, at one point, that professor of biology from UC Berkeley said &quot;we are 99% similar to the apes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s what Rashad mentioned also. 99% and that&#39;s very close, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But we know that based on what we learned here, 99% similar means there is 1% difference.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And 1% difference represents 1% of 300 billion nucleotides that form the genes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Which they say that the evolution says the same. And that is 3 billion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you have 3 billion combinations. And we know that 84 combinations is zero. The probability is zero that you have a certain combination having 84, you know, items.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we have... we are talking here about 300, not 300, 3 billion nucleotides.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so based on theory of probability, that&#39;s zero. But unfortunately in that program, this PhD from UC Riverside didn&#39;t say that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He just said &quot;well, you know, there&#39;s still a chance and this and that.&quot; So basically, I would say that this discussion will be further, you know, in the future that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God willing, most people will grab the idea. And they will see that even though the evolution is also a fact, because God says, and we learn from the Quran, that God creates.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And in terms of our scale, then the creation undergoes evolution.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this will merge the two theories and will bring the Quranic light into the discussion of creation and evolution.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[87:2] He creates and shapes. He shapes because God knows the need of every individual, every living being that He creates.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One example that was shown in that program was there was a species of bird who lived in a remote island.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And eventually evolved into many different, you know, within the same species, they look different.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The beak, one of them is longer, one of them is shorter. The longer beak because they need to get, you know, the nectar from the flower and all that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, they say &quot;they evolve according to the need.&quot; But we know that God knows the need of each individual.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then He creates over time the changes in that shape of the beak, for instance.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so, when we see that example, you know, we wonder about that example and we say &quot;well,...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Immediately, we remember God.

I think we can go back, even though we have done it probably two weeks ago.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can quickly go back to Sura 82, 81. I think 81 and 82 started with the description of the Day of Judgment. 82 says,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[82:1] When the heaven is shattered. [82:2] The planets are scattered. [82:3] The oceans are exploded.

[81:6] The oceans are set aflame. These are all overwhelming.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, these are heavy events.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this will happen in front of everybody. In other words, there will be a real terror on that Day,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a real terror for most people. It&#39;s a real terror, except for the believers. Because God says that He will send the angels to protect the believers from the event of that Day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But this is the beginning of the Day of Eternity. So, this is the day that will have no end. This is the day that will have...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How would I say it? An Eternal Day. So, there is no end to it. It started with all this destruction of the universe.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we know from all these verses I read from 81 and 82, what happens would be the implosion of the universe.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, we know the universe started with a big bang. And we are now still &quot;explode.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We are moving away from each other. I mean, we are in the same solar system.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the solar system is part of the galaxy. But the galaxies are actually moving away from each other.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because we are now still, if we think of a bubble, of a balloon, we are riding in the skin of balloon.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And as the balloon is, you know, being...we blow into the balloon, the balloon is getting bigger and bigger. And every point in that surface is getting farther apart.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the Day of Judgment, the opposite will occur. Everything will come back as if somebody is pulling it and will crash, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We will crash into each other. And that&#39;s why the stars crash and the sun is rolled and the planets disperse.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those are all the descriptions of the Overwhelming. Ocean explodes or ocean is set aflame.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I remember something that I read from a geology book recently.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That in 1883, most of you probably have heard of Mount Krakatoa.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is actually a small mountain in the middle of the sea, really.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But when it exploded in 1883, the whole caldera collapsed. And we know what a volcano is. Volcano is</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">actually a plug to the hot magma chamber. So, when a volcano forms, it really actually separates the magma chamber from the surface.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, when that mountain exploded, the whole thing collapsed. And</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">millions of tons of seawater comes straight into the magma chamber. And the result is a tremendous explosion that was heard 5, 6 thousand miles and caused 3 years of winter in the northern hemisphere.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s a very tremendous occasion. The Day of Judgment will be like, God says &quot;the mountains are all wiped out.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it will be Krakatoa on the grand scale. I mean, the whole universe.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, we&#39;re not talking just about the earth, but actually this is the whole universe. A man: About verse 17, I was watching a program on television entitled &quot;Ship of the Desert.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some of you all may have seen it. I&#39;d like to share some of the characteristics of the camels. It&#39;s fascinating.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of the reasons why people suffer or die in the sand or desert is because they can&#39;t step.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can&#39;t put your feet on anything solid. Every time you step, your feet, they just sink in the sand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, Allah constructed the shape of the camel&#39;s foot so when he steps, his feet do not sink</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in the sand, but they actually lay on top of the sand a few seconds to give him the stability or the animal the stability to walk.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s one attribute of the camel in terms of the shape of its feet. Another one is that during a sandstorm, a camel can close its notched nostrils so no sand will bleed in its nose, and</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it has an alternative air source. So, you know, here we are out here and we&#39;ve got these devil storms and sand storms and we&#39;re rolling up windows on cars, and all a camel does is this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It just keeps going, you know. A man: Without a finger. A man: Right, without the fingers, I mean, you know, without fingers, and you know,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sitting up, you can&#39;t help but feel humble while watching this program, it&#39;s just incredible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so it closes its nostrils. Everybody else is taking blankets and everything, covering themselves.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Another one is that the hair on the body is primarily just a little hair over the top and right over the sacks,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to reflect some of the heat, to prevent the water from evaporating.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, these are some of the characteristics, and now people have these land rovers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, can you think of all the mechanical engineers who were trying to design vehicles to go long distance over the deserts?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No one can design like Allah. Camel closes its nostrils, able to put its feet around, and what have you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thought I share, it was fantastic, watching that. A man: I think there was another thing about the camel&#39;s milk.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: How much you know about it? A man: Yeah, the milk, when the camel dehydrates,...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible) It takes about 57 days for the camel to be without water.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And when it dehydrates, every animal, like cows, for example, when they dehydrate, you take their milk,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the milk is so salty and it&#39;s undrinkable after it&#39;s dehydrated.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the camel&#39;s milk stays the same from the first day to the fifty seventh day, the milk, the condition of the water, the nutrition, always the same.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Also, when it dehydrates, all animals, when they dehydrate, if we take water, when we take food,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the cell cannot hold all that water at the same time. The cell is gone, and you will die unless you take water slowly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The camel can take 400 gallons of water, and the cells will come back better than the way they were.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, so, (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Is there anybody here? (unintelligible) No?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Okay, the camel is the only animal whose milk, when the animal dehydrates, like the cows or something,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">their milk becomes salty, so salty, you cannot drink it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the camel&#39;s milk, the content stays the same for 57 days.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I guess that&#39;s one of the reasons that it lasts 57 days.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, for a long period of time, still, you drink the milk.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other thing, almost the same.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we dehydrate, if we drink water real fast, then our cells will explode because they cannot take the water.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the camel is not like that. They... God designed in such a way, even when the animal dehydrates, can drink as much as 400 gallons of water and</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">these cells will be in the same shape with all the water.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, that&#39;s why God mentioned camel.

You must remember that anything you do in this world that has nothing to do with God is a waste of life.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a terrible waste of time. We do it only out of necessity. The reason we go to work is to make a living.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But if there is anything that has to do, that does not have to do with God, it&#39;s a waste of time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So number 7 here, [94:7] Whenever possible you shall strive. It means you must never pass up a chance that you&#39;ll strive in the cause of God,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a Friday Prayer, a lesson, a meeting, a Quranic study.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is God&#39;s advice to you and me.

If you give up an hour of work, for example, for the sake of Friday Prayer,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God guarantees it in the Quran that if you give up, you&#39;ll make more money. So, it should be a material gain as well as spiritual gain.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God is the only One who dispenses provisions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[94:7] Whenever possible you shall strive. [94:8] Seeking only your Lord.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fortunately, we are the people who hear this advice. It&#39;s other people who need this advice.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because we automatically do this.

The day and the night are profound signs, as you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They remind us that the earth is hanging in space. And the male and the female.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, these three profound verses tell us that... actually this short Sura tells the secrets of happiness.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it is very important to know which path will lead you to happiness in this world and forever,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and which path will lead you to misery in this world and forever. So, you see in verse 7, the path to happiness... in Sura 54, if you remember, God says &quot;He directs you to happiness and misery.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He controls that. And it is now established that mere success does not bring happiness.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, your works are of various kinds, and they will lead you to either path, happiness or misery.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And what I wanted to emphasize is verses 5 and 18. Both of them talk about charity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this short Sura, two verses talk about charity. It&#39;s because it&#39;s a continuous process.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just like we feed, God wants to remind us that just because we continuously feed our body... how many times did we drink today?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You drank water or coke or something today. You drank. You ate.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You really take care of your body, your garment. So, God is reminding us to take care of the real person, of you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To take care of you is a continuous process, just like the eating and the drinking and the sleeping, and the showering, the things that you do for your body.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a continuous process and like the Five Contact Prayers, continuous process.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Charity also is a continuous process because you continuously make money.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you have to set aside 2.5% for your relatives, your parents, and so on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible). The three verses, three profound signs. This is common in the short Suras.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Receive something that&#39;s very important. And here the important thing is the secret of happiness.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: If you do these continuous processes, that develop your soul, God promises you happiness now and forever.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: So, these three verses are consistent, but in 8, God says in the fourth verse, [92:4] Your works are of various kinds.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible) Edip: Yes, because (unintelligible) from our life, a good life, and then you are (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: I think we&#39;re getting...

It&#39;s a very good investment.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the reason God repeats it is because God knows that we tend to forget or neglect to do it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We seem to do the Five daily Prayers easily. But charity is something that we tend to forget because we get involved in spending all the money we&#39;ve got.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We didn&#39;t set aside the 2.5%.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Professional beggars. Do not reprimand the beggar. Charitable Organizations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: So, the reason this is... also repetition is psychologically important.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Sabahi: This is a comment.

Maybe. You have to use discretion, except remember, you cannot be suspicious.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, you have to know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tucson is the food bank.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In Tucson, there&#39;s a food bank. But, sometimes you meet these people in the street. They come to your door.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You have to act.

Then, you go further and further.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Priorities are stated in the Quran. It is something that...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is your family...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Ok. I&#39;m glad you brought this up. Some people think that this was directed to Muhammad personally.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because of &quot;your Lord will give you...&quot; [93:7] He found you astray, and He guided you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Verses explained &ldquo;we found you astray&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You will not get the Mohammedans to confess that he ever was astray.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ahmad Rayan is laughing because I had my father, he was for 4 months here and I wanted him to say it</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Muhammad was astray&quot; and he wouldn&#39;t say it. We had a lot of funny encounters.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because when I showed him all the other verses showing that Muhammad did make mistakes, he would say &quot;ok&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So, he was astray.&quot; And then five minutes later he changed his mind. So, we...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The way he said &quot;ok, he was astray, but became a...&quot; Something with (unintelligible) I remember.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But anyway, &quot;He found you&quot; and they will not agree that he was astray.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I chose to make the translation general. [93:8] He found you poor, and He made you rich.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because it&#39;s applicable for everybody. If they want to apply it... Ironically, most of them, almost all of them, apply to Muhammad but they will not accept verse 7.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: In almost all the Tafseers and interpretations, they interpret this Sura as if God is talking to Muhammad only person.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: They misinterpret this verse. Verse 7 is a problem, a very big problem for them. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Because their eyes have become (unintelligible) Prophethood (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then they want to interpret... one of the most famous interpretations is, when he was a child, he lost his way, God showed him his way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible). Dr. Sabahi: That&#39;s exactly what Rashad said that he was poor and God made him rich.

Dr. Khalifa: Exit...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: But if the speed of the stone is less than 11 km per second, it will come back many kilometers later,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it will stop and then will fall on the earth. This is Gravity law.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And now from Quran, we understand, we know, that the second theory will occur.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This theory is called as... What is the opposite of open?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Implode. Edip: Implodes. Yes. Universe Theory.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: But what is the Quran&#39;s theory? Edip: Quran&#39;s theory is implosion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They will come together like the paper of the book. And yes, this is the description of implosion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Why will it happen? Edip: Creation was explosion. Edip: What? Dr. Khalifa: Why will the implosion happen?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Because God will say &quot;be&quot; and it will be.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: No, it&#39;s not just that. Anybody wants...?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible) Yeah? Emily. Emily: Cause... Edip: God will come. Dr. Khalifa: Yes, there you go.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You have to speak fast, yeah? Okay, now. So, now, we&#39;re talking. Dr. Khalifa: So, this implosion will happen because God will physically come to this universe.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: God&#39;s physical existence, when God comes, this universe cannot stand for God&#39;s physical existence, then they will explode... implode.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Do you have any question about this part? Edip: If you ask, we can explain.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Why? It&#39;s like pulling teeth, you know? It&#39;s got the information there, but you have to pull it out. Edip: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: So, do ask him questions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beth: I have a question. What about verse 8 and 9?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: [81:8] The girl who was buried alive is asked: [81:9] For what crime was she killed?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From Quran, we learn that Arabs, they were humiliating women, and they were not glad with the girls.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When they see girl as a baby, they didn&#39;t want girls, and they were killing them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this was a very great crime, offense. And also now we can see the extension of this understanding.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In many places in the world, girls are also the second, girls are the second class of human beings.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I think killing of girls was because of economy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Boys, when they become adults, they could gain money or they could work, but girls at that time, they couldn&#39;t do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this was one of the reasons.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What?

Edip: Yes. Edip: What&#39;s your question, brother?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why? A man: Are the beasts called (unintelligible)?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: They are called (unintelligible). A man: What does that refer to?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: There are two ways to interpret, to understand this. One way, the beasts, when a big event, explosion, or a great shock happens, from fear they come together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All animals resurrected &ndash; &ldquo;you will meet your pet&rdquo;. Black holes are similar representations of End of the universe.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They will come together. This may be expression of this event.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or in Hereafter, God also will resurrect all animals.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: The second interpretation is correct. Because in Sura 6, verse 38, you can see that that, remember?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(6:38) &#1579;&#1615;&#1605;&#1614;&#1617; &#1573;&#1616;&#1604;&#1614;&#1609;&#1648; &#1585;&#1614;&#1576;&#1616;&#1617;&#1607;&#1616;&#1605;&#1618; &#1610;&#1615;&#1581;&#1618;&#1588;&#1614;&#1585;&#1615;&#1608;&#1606;&#1614; Edip: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: So, it&#39;s the same word being used, that all the animals will be resurrected and will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: I also have a comment. So, if you had a pet or anything, you will meet them all on the Day of Judgement.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: I have a comment which I&#39;m not sure is accurate because the earth is (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Verse 2, verses are very similar also to describe the black hole phenomenon where a star changes its size very quickly</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and then shrinks in a gravitational (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, the black hole phenomenon is a minute representation of this. This is a universal black hole.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s similar to it. But I wanna go back to the 8 and 9 that Beth was asking about.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t like to depress you, but this is actually still happening in Saudi Arabia today.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I call it a cultural disaster. And this is why when they walk into this mosque, they are shocked to see a woman&#39;s hair.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they run away. I mean, they cover up the woman, and they regard them in such a disastrous way that</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lies attributed to Masjid Tucson &ldquo;men and woman pray side by side&rdquo; or &ldquo;woman lead the prayer&rdquo;. Should be no preference for boy or girl when having children.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they used to kill the baby girls in the past. And I had a Saudi friend 10 years ago who went back to Saudi Arabia, and he came back.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was almost crying. He said &quot;you can find baby girls in garbage bins now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was from Medina. He said &quot;this is in the prophet&#39;s city.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s very depressing. This is what I call... I mean, how will you change a cultural behavior like that?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the Quran didn&#39;t do it, what is going to do it? But this will, this will make you understand why they are shocked when they walk in here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they make up stories like &quot;in Masjid Tucson, the men and the women pray side by side,&quot; which is not true.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they make up things like &quot;women lead the prayer in Masjid Tucson. It&#39;s just they have this severe complex.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But even today, these things happen. They don&#39;t have accurate records of pregnancies or even births in Saudi Arabia.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is why it is significant that it is mentioned.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this was mentioned in other places in the Quran. [81:8] The girl who was buried alive is asked: [81:9] For what crime was she killed?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And of course the hint is for those who commit this horrendous crime.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s a demonstration of stupidity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, believers don&#39;t have that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I come across believers once in a while who prefer to have a son over a daughter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I really sock it to them when they come up with that. Because there is no preference whatsoever, I mean, as far as God is concerned.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It may even be the other way around. In fact, there are sayings, I think here in the States maybe, even other countries also,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that say &quot;the girl brings a son, but the son is taken away by his wife.&quot; Something to that effect.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: &quot;When your son marries, you lose a son. When Your daughter marries, you gain a son.&quot; Dr. Khalifa: Right, something like that. I&#39;ve heard it in different ways, said in different ways.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So,...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right. Yes. He should be brought out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s such a horrendous crime that the Quran gives it a lot of attention. It also reflects the kind of mentality that exists there, even now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Forced dress code is similar to burying an infant alive. Oppression of woman.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Any comments, Lisa?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Exactly, yes, exactly. I&#39;m glad you mentioned that. Yeah, even the women who survive, they&#39;re actually buried alive, the way they demand that they&#39;re covered up this way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ismail just came from Iran. And how does the streets look like?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The ladies, they have to be covered up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How is the society in general accepting this? Is there any kind of rebellion among some people?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ismail: No, there are some women who have been killed in the same way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Is it a widespread rebellion or is it limited? Are the people accepting it?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Like just take the ladies who used to walk in the streets in European clothes. Now, they have to cover up in this black stuff.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, they are... They&#39;re forced, because otherwise they&#39;ll be killed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, did you hear over there? Ismail says that there is rebellion against this forced dress in Iran, but they can do nothing about it. If they speak up, they&#39;ll be killed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it is a terrible oppression. This is a form of burial. They&#39;re being buried alive.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What&#39;s her name? 60 Minutes. What&#39;s her name? Diane Sawyer? Diane Sawyer went to Iran, and she had to, before the plane landed in Iran, she had to cover up her head, and she made a big deal out of this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s a double standard. Go ahead, Douglas.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Douglas: I was shocked to find out even today, that some of the so-called Muslim countries, as far as I can tell, just out of sheer suspicion of people who would throw their daughter out of the house,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and (unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Oh, yeah. Of daughters. Douglas: Can you try to rationalize the takeover of all the property, or how you&#39;re going to get the property to take their lives?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are a few incidents of this type that might happen, where the husband would say</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I don&#39;t want you to do something wrong with me, and murder his wife, or throw her out, or kill his daughter.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Well, I have on my desk a piece of news from the Arizona newspaper,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">where in Iran they ordered... No, no, excuse me. In Pakistan, a judge ordered the execution of six people, because of sex crimes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is the headline. And when you read the article, you find out that this lady didn&#39;t like her husband, so she left him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, according to the Quran, marriage is a contract between two people, and once out, the contract is invalid anymore.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But they don&#39;t give this right to the woman, according to the so-called Islamic Shari&#39;a.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I don&#39;t know how many months or years later, she married somebody else.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, her former husband complained, and they ruled that she and her new husband have committed adultery.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the judge ordered them stoned to death. And four of their friends were also stoned to death, because they knew about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have this on my desk. If you don&#39;t believe it, you can read it later. This is the kind of mentality that is...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">where their women are oppressed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we read in Sura 28 that God feels for the oppressed, and He makes it up to them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">According to Hadith and Sunnah, the majority of inhabitants of Hell are women. But I&#39;m convinced that the opposite is true, because of the oppression that they undergo.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I served in Saudi Arabia for the United Nations, I came across a daily program</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">where people send messages, and most of these messages were from women.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m telling you, I cried. I actually cried listening to that program. Because a typical story will be a woman whose husband disappeared for six months or a year.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She doesn&#39;t know where he is. She&#39;s grounded in the apartment or the house or the place that&#39;s assigned for her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Rashad Khalifa thanks God for the freedom in America to practise following Quran alone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And her in-laws bring whatever food or whatever that keeps her alive. She never leaves the place. It&#39;s just like a prison.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is a typical story. And she&#39;s asking for help.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Obviously she snuck out a letter to that radio program.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it is a tragic situation. And... I guess abandoning the Quran is one of the reasons for this happening.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Any other comments or questions? I just want you know what is happening over there so we can thank God for the freedom we have here and the ability to practice the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip, Back to Edip.

They will look at the proofs objectively, without anything holding them back.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it pleases us to see the people, the new generation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So this here, if you excuse me for putting it in, it is for the new generations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I hope most of you will understand anyway.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ok, back to Edip. Edip: Do you have any questions about this part?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: If you have any questions, don&#39;t be shy, because you have to bring out any doubts and kill them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes. It&#39;s interesting that I find some of these things happening without me paying attention, like</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[81:24] He is not holding back any news. [81:24] He is not holding back any news.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">because I&#39;m not holding back anything. I want everything to be clear and open.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then I read the verse and I say &quot;yeah, this is what is happening.&quot; And the point that Lisa raised of obey and trust,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[81:21] He shall be obeyed and trusted. It is not the person.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s obey and trust because we&#39;re receiving information from God. And this is why God ties the commandment of &quot;obeying God and obeying the messenger&quot; together throughout the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because I&#39;m just as excited as you when we receive new information.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That straightened everything that we were doing.

[81:22] Your friend (Rashad) is not crazy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This ties in with the other statement of the Quran. It says &quot;I&#39;ve lived with you many years.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, this is a quotation in the Quran, do you remember it? I forget where it is exactly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But what it says is that here&#39;s a person who has been with you for many years and you know he&#39;s not crazy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because a person who is not a messenger of God, who claims to be a messenger of God, will have to be crazy, if he&#39;s not a messenger.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It will be a person who has no belief that he will meet God someday and will be asked by God about everything he&#39;s doing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or he&#39;s a person who doesn&#39;t have any mental capacity whatsoever. And the statement that I&#39;ve lived with you many years is because, you know, I got to know you. We know each other.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And obviously, I&#39;m not crazy or mentally retarded or any....</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So this statement, [81:22] Your friend (Rashad) is not crazy. is...ties in with that I stayed with you for a number of years. It is God&#39;s design</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to appoint messengers after the age of 40. This has been consistent except for the Prophet Jesus for special reasons.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But every messenger was appointed after the age of 40. So, he lived among his people for 40 years. They knew him as a normal person who was a merchant or a shepherd or</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">going about his business. They know he&#39;s a normal person. All of a sudden, he says &quot;I&#39;m God&#39;s messenger.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And invariably they accuse him of being crazy. So, he says &quot;I lived with you so many years and you didn&#39;t know that I was crazy. So, why do you call me crazy now?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;re going to examine what I am saying. Yes. 10:10?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">10-16, yes. 10:16, yes. So, this is the idea.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cause if you...If a person lives with you for so many years, you know him closely, and you know very well he&#39;s not crazy,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">then he&#39;s either, he&#39;s really a God&#39;s messenger or he&#39;s a very very bad person who&#39;s trying to trick God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s one of the extremes. Nothing in between.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes.

Or chances are, it&#39;s in the seventh or the first universe.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you consider ours the seventh universe, that fulfillment of the Covenant occurred in the first universe.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And in the last conference, as you know, I shared it with you in detail, and I&#39;m glad to share it with anybody in detail at any time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But most of you know, those of you who don&#39;t know it, I&#39;ll be glad to share it with you again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But briefly, I was summoned to the first universe.

The elite of the elite are the people who exist at the same time when the message is new</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and the people are rejecting it, and you are being persecuted for accepting that message, which is worshipping God alone,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">accepting the word of God alone. It&#39;s a very heavy responsibility, and the people who accept it are very, very, very, I can say this forever, fortunate.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because they are the elite of the elite for eternity. And you&#39;re not born at this time by coincidence. There is a reason for it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Obviously you deserve it. But to say that we are lucky or fortunate is the understatement of the century.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is really a very, very exciting part of history, and I&#39;m just talking as a person.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God happens to want us to know certain information to correct our path. And God&#39;s system, as we learn from the Quran, is that He selects one of us to distribute the information through one of us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And doesn&#39;t make this one of us any better, or worse, or special.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no... and we have many lessons in the Quran indicating this. Moses, one of the great messengers, God sent a teacher in human form.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He could have been a human. Probably he was an angel. But God didn&#39;t tell us if he was a human or an angel. The fact is that Moses existed, and there was another servant of God who taught him a few things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it&#39;s just a system whereby God distributes, disseminates information to all of us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:29:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We are a very fortunate generation indeed.

No. But the information came at the right time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:30:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was just amazing. I mean, I will start the computer, and I will be working on this subject, and they will walk in with the information.

Information comes as we need it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:30:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is why we&#39;re so positive about God&#39;s signs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:30:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We don&#39;t have doubts.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c5 c1 c4" id="h.q9uhmd4db59"><span class="c8">19 Quran Study From Behrouz 919 Sura 2;89 119 Witchcraft Reverting Intro To Blue Quran No 13</span></h1><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: [2:89] ...They rejected it.

Across from that, you see verses from the Old Testament and the New Testament prophesying</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">0:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the advent of the Prophet Muhammad, the final prophet.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">0:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You see Moses in Deuteronomy 18:15 says &quot;a prophet like me,&quot; meaning a message-bearing messenger.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">0:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;...will the Lord, your God, raise up for you from among your kinsmen;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">0:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Arabs and Jews are kinsmen. &quot;to him you shall listen.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And in Deuteronomy 18:19, God says &quot;I will raise up for them a prophet like you...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God was speaking to Moses. &quot;...from among their kinsmen and will put my words into his mouth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He shall tell them all that I command him. If any man will not listen to My words which he speaks in My name, I Myself will make him answer for it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, there&#39;s the prediction of the coming of the Prophet Muhammad to the Jews.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, the Jews also were expecting the Messiah, Jesus, but when he came they wouldn&#39;t acknowledge him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was a human being like them. In spite of the miracles that he showed them, they failed to recognize him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They called him &quot;imposter, a carpenter,&quot; not God&#39;s messenger.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s just, you&#39;ve seen today how bad the human being is. And we are the hardcore, egotistic gang among God&#39;s creatures.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And as you see here, God is saying &quot;I will put My words in his mouth, to him you shall listen.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Jews were aware of this, as far as the Messiah was concerned, as far as Muhammad was concerned.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it takes killing the ego to sit down and listen to a human being like you and me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is what we&#39;re exercising now. We&#39;re killing our ego in order to be redeemed, knowing</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that we are listening to God&#39;s words in the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We&#39;re submitting to God, in whatever God does or says.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the New Testament, you see the statement here from John 14, 16, 17. &quot;I will ask the</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Father and He will give you another Paraclete, to be with you always, the spirit of truth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And in John 16:13, &quot;when the spirit of truth comes to you, he will guide you to all truth</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and will announce to you the things to come.&quot; So, the Christians also were given prophecy about the Prophet Muhammad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But when he came, brought the Quran, a fantastic miracle, and he told them to worship God alone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He told them who Jesus was, but they still they cannot recognize him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is extended to the Messenger of the Covenant. The Muslims are recipients of the scripture. And God told them in the scripture &quot;the Messenger of the Covenant will come</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">after all the prophets have delivered their messages.&quot; And I&#39;m quoting here Malachi. &quot;Lo, I am sending My messenger to prepare the way before Me, and suddenly,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He will come to the temple the Lord whom you seek, and the Messenger of the Covenant whom you desire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, he is coming, says the Lord of hosts,&quot; which is Rabbil &lsquo;Alameen in Arabic, &quot;but who will endure the day of his coming?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And who can stand when he appears? For he is like the refiner&#39;s fire. He will sit purifying and refining.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So again, it&#39;s the ego here. &quot;Who will endure the day of his coming?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And how can you tell us that two verses that the Quran we&#39;ve known all along had two verses wrong in it?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How do you tell us that the Salat Prayer we&#39;ve been doing has been wrong?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And as you know, God blessed us, but because we did this gradually. We fixed. We were doing everything wrong.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You and I were doing everything wrong. And it takes killing the ego to give up things that we&#39;ve been taught by our parents and things</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Takes strength to kill the Ego. Explains the rejection of Truth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that we&#39;ve been doing for a long time. It takes, actually, it takes more courage and more strength to say &quot;I was wrong, I&#39;m gonna do the right thing now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m gonna give up what was wrong even though my parents taught me that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But this is not the case with the majority of people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is what the Muslims are doing today. I mean, the Quran clearly says &quot;Muhammad was not the last messenger. He wasn&#39;t the Messenger of the Covenant.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I&#39;m not harping on this issue, but just the verse happens to state that, 89.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[2:89] When a scripture came to them from God confirming what they have, and even though they used to prophesy its advent to the disbelievers, when their own prophecy came to pass, they rejected it. God&#39;s condemnation thus afflicts the disbelievers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this brings out their disbelief, because they claim to be believers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they claim to believe the Quran. Yet, when the Quran comes to pass, a Quranic prophecy, they fail to uphold it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These same people who are rejecting the Messenger of the Covenant would have rejected the Prophet Muhammad if they existed at the same time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They would have been the first to fight him. In fact, the Prophet struggled for 13 years in Mecca.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were rejecting him, stoning him, banishing him, boycotting him and his followers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These are the same people. And those bigwigs who are meeting in Chicago to preserve the finality of prophethood,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they would have been the first people to fight the Prophet Muhammad if they existed in his time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, they are Abu Lahab&#39;s, every single one of them. I mean, who was Abu Lahab?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Abu Lahab was the religious leader of his time, following the corrupted religion of Abraham, Islam or submission.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he opposed the Prophet Muhammad who was telling him &quot;worship God alone. Here&#39;s the scripture of this religion.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Abu Lahab faltered.

Thus, they taught the people witchcraft.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What is witchcraft and magic? It&#39;s using the jinns.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Witchcraft&rdquo; explained, uses the Jinns.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s no big deal, actually. I think you go to the library and learn magic, witchcraft. There are many books on witchcraft.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, you don&#39;t need any books. You can sit in a room and talk to the jinns until they respond to you if you want to get in trouble, because they are in the same room with you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if you talk to them long enough, some rascal jinn passing by who wants to have some fun will respond to you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And like Sura 72 tells us, they will give you trouble in the end because they&#39;re much more powerful than you. I can tell you that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, you can imagine an invisible lion passing by and you&#39;re trying to pet him or something.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But he&#39;s invisible. They&#39;re much, much more powerful than the lion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it doesn&#39;t make sense that they will be your slave. They will fool you for a while. They will do certain things for you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is why those people that you see on the TV, they don&#39;t last.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because jinns will not serve them for too long. Maybe a few months and then they disappear. Otherwise, it would have been a big hit.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I remember one of them, when the election was between Carter and Reagan,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">this ESP fellow, using the jinns, was on the Today Show two weeks before the elections.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he gave Jane Pauley, is that her name? A woman: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: He gave her an envelope, sealed envelope. And he said &quot;this envelope will have who won the elections and how many votes,&quot; if it is Reagan or Carter, and how many votes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I will come back on the election. The next day of the election, we&#39;ll open the envelope and you&#39;re gonna see in it the winner and the number of votes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t see that program, but he probably came and they probably opened the envelope and saw that the winner was Reagan and how many votes. So, how did that happen?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They show you on TV somebody who&#39;s standing on a stage and some person in the audience</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">will take his wallet out and this fellow on the stage will read what&#39;s in the wallet, the money, the driver&#39;s license.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How does he do this? He&#39;s using jinns. Now, this is fantastic, right?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it should be a show that will last for 10 years, but they don&#39;t. Because the jinn will go read the wallet and will come and whisper it in his ears and he read the</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thing and everybody will be impressed. But next week, when he wants to use the jinn again, the jinn will say &quot;wait a minute, who do you think you are?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they will not cooperate. Sura 72.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Usually it is the last time you see them on the TV. The jinn is having fun, you know, national TV, you know, impressing the audience and all that, but they don&#39;t last.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For one thing, they can take a trip that is 10 light years away, then they lose their cooperating entity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I wanna go back to 102. [2:102] ....Solomon was not a disbeliever, while the devils are disbelievers. Thus, they taught the people witchcraft that was sent down through the two angels of Babel, Haroot and Maroot.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[2:102] ....These two did not divulge such knowledge without pointing out that &quot;This is a test. You shall not abuse such knowledge.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, God actually sent the knowledge to the planet earth as part of the test to see who&#39;s gonna use it, who&#39;s gonna abuse it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And as you know, a lot of people do abuse it. You should come to Egypt and see what they do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[2:102] ......But the people used it in such evil schemes as the breaking up of marriages. They can never harm anyone against the will of God. They learn only what hurts them, not what benefits them,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[2:102] ......and they knew full well that whoever practices such evil will have no share in the Hereafter. Miserable indeed is what they sold their souls for, if they only knew.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, when you hear about this phenomenon in the newspaper, you understand exactly what is happening.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">103.

The disbelievers have incurred a painful retribution.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can generalize this.

Dr. Khalifa: Hebrew it was. Do you know Hebrew?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: I don&#39;t know Hebrew. Dr. Khalifa: So, how do you know it&#39;s not a dirty word? Edip: Let me. My understanding, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s correct or not, &quot;Raa&#39;ena&quot; means &quot;be our shepherd&quot; and</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: those people that who used this accept themselves as sheep and...

Edip: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: But let&#39;s not look. I don&#39;t wanna waste time on this one. But it&#39;s just, in the Hebrew language, it sounds like a dirty word.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Pardon? Dr. Khalifa: &quot;Raa&#39;ena&quot; is Arabic. But you can say an Arabic word that&#39;s dirty in English and vice versa.

They can never harm anyone against the will of God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, (unintelligible) people (unintelligible) God willed it to happen.

You&#39;re forcing me to give you a real life story. Dr. Khalifa: Ok, there&#39;s a person who uses witchcraft and tried to harm me in this way and the jinn, that was supposed to come and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Rashad Khalifa explains an incident of Witchcraft against him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hurt me, came here and my... we all have guards, angels.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this was against the will of God. So, the angels told the jinn &quot;what are you here for?&quot; He said &quot;we&#39;re here to hit Rashad.&quot; He said &quot;ok, you go back and hit the person who sent you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the jinn did and sure enough that person called on the machine here and she was almost dying.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it backfired on her. But this is an example of &quot;they cannot harm anyone against the will of God.&quot; Did that confuse you more?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: No. Dr. Khalifa: Ok. This person practiced witchcraft from, from a country that is famous for witchcraft.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And she was trying to stop me. So, she practiced witchcraft on me but what happened was that the jinn that was supposed to carry out that,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">since it is against God&#39;s will, I didn&#39;t deserve it, I didn&#39;t do anything wrong on that day, on that day,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the jinn was sent back and did that thing to that person and she almost died. And we have a few witnesses.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: Are we talking about real witchcraft? Dr. Khalifa: Real. This is real witchcraft. I&#39;m telling you. She almost died. She was paralyzed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What country? Haiti. Haiti. Haiti is full of voodoo. And voodoo, for example, is that real? Is voodoo real?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is real and it is jinn. When you make a doll that looks like Muhtesem, and you get a pin,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and the jinn... now the jinns, as you know, are very fast. They see that you&#39;re poking,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pulling his ear, for example, so they go and pull his ear. This is the mechanism of it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s real. I mean, this is what the Quran is teaching us. Yes. A woman: So, if two people get divorced, does that, you know,... I mean,...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Well, everything, ultimately, is the will of God. Ok. But I want you to understand this that bad things are from us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Good things are from God. For example, I use the example of the fire. If you turn the stove on, it is God&#39;s law that if you put your finger in the fire, it will hurt, right?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s God&#39;s law. So, it is the will of God that if you put your finger in the fire, it will hurt.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But if you use the fire to cook your burned rice, the Iranian people burn rice at the bottom,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they don&#39;t know how to cook rice. You can use the, you can use the fire...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: (unintelligible). A woman: (unintelligible) their faces (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: I know the Persians (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: That&#39;s my favorite part, the burned rice.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: You know, at first, they were saying &quot;the dumb guy, you know, he doesn&#39;t think we do it on purpose.&quot; But anyway, so you can use the fire to cook your food or to burn your finger.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, if you use it to cook the food, it&#39;s from God. If you burn your finger, it&#39;s from you because you decided to put your finger in the fire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But not every people who are divorced are because of witchcraft. However, they do use witchcraft for this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it is in accordance with God&#39;s will, if these people are out of God&#39;s protection, the jinns will bother them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But you are... when you are in God&#39;s protection, nothing can touch you. They cannot touch you. A woman: But what if individuals have tried to, you know, hurt, you know, two other people and they were hurt for a while and then they got better and then the other person (unintelligible) on them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, and they were ultimately the ones (unintelligible). They were hurt, you know for the time being. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: I don&#39;t if it was witchcraft or not but whatever... Dr. Khalifa: That was in accordance with God&#39;s will, they were not protected at the time for some reason.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Angels guarding you are much stronger than the Jinns. Most people are out of God&rsquo;s kingdom. When you miss a Prayer (salat) you are out of God&rsquo;s protection. &ldquo;Pinches&rdquo; controlled by God. Talk of the EVIL eye.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But this day, they can repent any time. They can join God&#39;s protection any time. Then, the jinns who are bothering them will not be able to do anything anymore.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When you&#39;re in God&#39;s Kingdom nothing can touch you. This is the message that we&#39;ve been living it. We&#39;ve been living it for 11-12 years now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, our confidence is increasing. It is now absolute when God tells you &quot;I guarantee you perfect happiness, perfect health perfect wealth,&quot; God means it and He does it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, using the jinns... remember the angels who are guarding you are much stronger. But if you&#39;re out of God&#39;s protection,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">if you&#39;re a... the person is bad and is against God and an idol worshipper, the angels who are guarding him hate him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, when a jinn comes to slap him on the face, they say &quot;yeah, be my guest.&quot; This is what the mechanism is of being out of God&#39;s protection.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right They&#39;re not protected if they are not strong believers. It is... Most people are out of God&#39;s protection. It&#39;s basic.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it takes discipline, strength and worshipping God, practicing in order to be protected.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Remember the verses in Sura 41. It gives you the conditions of being in God&#39;s protection.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Page 480. Verse 30. It says,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[41:30] Those who say: &quot;Our Lord is GOD,&quot;... We say &quot;our Lord is God alone.&quot; But that&#39;s not all.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[41:30] ....then lead a righteous life,... So, it takes discipline and work, worshipping God, the Five daily Prayers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, when you miss a Prayer, you&#39;re out of God&#39;s protection even though you&#39;re a believer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When you miss a Prayer, you&#39;re out of God&#39;s protection but God puts limits though on how much you pay, how hard the pinch is. We learn this very well from the Old Testament and the Quran</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that God puts limits on the jinns, Satan, your enemies. So that you don&#39;t get more of a pinch than you deserve. So, when you miss a Prayer, you get a pinch.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is how we come to realize that God runs the world, controls everything.

[2:111] They said, &quot;No one will enter Paradise unless he is Jewish or Christian!&quot; Such is wishful thinking on their part. Say, &quot;Show us your proof, if you are truthful.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the Muslims, so called Muslims, fall in the same trap.

It is... anyone who worships God alone will make it to Heaven.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The criterion is to worship God alone. There&#39;s a book circulating in the United States now</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that was written in Saudi Arabia.

Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Doctors. The translator and the writer are both doctors from WAMY, World Assembly of Muslim Youth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: I was a member of WAMY. Dr. Khalifa: You were?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Edip used to be a member of WAMY. Don&#39;t worry. We all were.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Ahmad (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Yes, of course. He was the first president of...

[2:112] ...those who devote themselves absolutely to GOD...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it doesn&#39;t tell you if it&#39;s a Hindu or a Buddhist or a Muslim or what. [2:112] ....those who devote themselves absolutely to GOD alone, while leading a righteous life, will receive their recompense from their Lord; they have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve.*</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is similar to the verse 62 that names names says &quot;the Jews, the Christians, the converts, the Muslims, any of them, who devotes</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">themselves absolutely to God and lead a righteous life, they will receive the recompense from their Lord. They have nothing to fear nor will they grieve.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The advantage that you have over the Jew or the Christian is that they lost the Contact Prayer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You have the Contact Prayer. You have the complete message from God and you have the complete practices. Nothing was lost.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the difference is that it&#39;s like a person who&#39;s going to Boulder, Colorado without a map and a person who&#39;s going with a map. You have a map.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: But they don&#39;t have the right map. Dr. Khalifa: They have a map from 1800. They don&#39;t even have the map. They lost it. Sura 19.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, God says &quot;He will give them credit for any worship that they do but it is the hard way. It takes longer. They don&#39;t grow at the same as you do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because what you&#39;re following... did you see the mathematical coding of Al-F&atilde;tehah? They don&#39;t have Al-F&atilde;tehah. God gave us this and it causes you to grow much faster, more efficiently.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But they&#39;re still... they get credit for worshiping God alone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">113. [2:113] The Jews said, &quot;The Christians have no basis,&quot; while the Christians said, &quot;The Jews have no basis.&quot; Although they both read the scripture.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not the same scripture. Both of them read the scripture. [2:113] ...those who possess no knowledge have uttered the same kind of utterances. GOD will judge them all on the Day of Resurrection, regarding their disputes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What does this say? It says, [2:113] The Jews said, &quot;The Christians have no basis.&quot; The Christians said, &quot;The Jews have no basis.&quot; Even though both read the scripture.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, God is saying that you can reach God through either way as long as you or they worship God alone, devote yourself to God alone and lead a righteous life.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Did you say something? Edip: I said &quot;those who possess no knowledge have uttered the same kind of utterances.&quot; They&#39;re just Muslims today.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Yes, exactly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Yes, sir?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Yes, a few, quite a few. In fact, we passed... maybe coming up, and we passed a couple of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">113. 114.

[2:114] Who are more evil than those who boycott GOD&#39;s mosques, where His name is commemorated, and contribute to their desertion? These ought not to enter therein except fearfully. They have incurred humiliation in this life, and severe retribution in the Hereafter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, we must encourage each other to frequent the mosque. The Quranic study is a perfect example.

Gross Blasphemy [2:116] They said, &quot;GOD has begotten a son!&quot; Be He glorified; never! To Him belongs everything in the heavens and the earth; all are subservient to Him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course as we increase, our knowledge increases and we realize how vast our universe is,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and how vast the other universes are and that they&#39;re all in God&#39;s hand. With this knowledge, we realize how ridiculous such a statement is.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s like... it&#39;s not even like that, but it&#39;s like saying &quot;you&#39;re the father of a virus. Here&#39;s your son.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Go find an electronic microscope to see him, your dear son.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&#39;t you love your son? Right here, at the tip of my finger,&quot; there are a few viruses probably.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Attains certainty one can see miracles.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So ridiculous.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[2:117] He is the Initiator of the heavens and the earth: to have anything done, He simply says to it, &quot;Be,&quot; and it is.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[2:118] Those who possess no knowledge have said, &quot;If only GOD could speak to us, or some miracle could come to us!&quot; Others before them have uttered the same kind of utterances; their minds are similar. We do manifest the miracles for those who have attained certainty.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is a very important principle.

Then, I forgot.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, okay. I thought I asked a few people, but anyway. So, Laurie will give us the Quranic study next week, IN SHAA ALLAH.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Are there any questions before we close this study?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s okay, any general questions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Was it the... Yes, it is Divine.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it is Bar&atilde;&#39;ah (Ultimatum). No. It was Bar&atilde;&#39;ah until about a hundred years ago, when they changed it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, what I&#39;m doing here is taking everything back to the original, including the names of the Suras. The names of the Suras are Divine.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, I didn&#39;t need to, because it is known actually equally as Bar&atilde;&#39;ah and Tawbah, so I didn&#39;t need to, I didn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It probably does, probably does. But we&#39;re not aware yet of it. Because the names must stay the way they came down.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Let me see. The numbers of the Suras, yes. But the names...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: I have some significant news, but it&#39;s not all about the Suras.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: There are some Suras that the names of the Suras are related with some very interesting news. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: I&#39;m sure there are... I&#39;m sure there will be, because everything in the Quran is mathematically coded.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So far we don&#39;t have anything established yet. Edip: But this Sura, according to also traditional knowledge, also has two names.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is Tawbah or Bar&atilde;&#39;ah. Some people use Bar&atilde;&#39;ah, but it&#39;s also Bar&atilde;&#39;ah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Yes, it is well known as Bar&atilde;&#39;ah and Tawbah, but Tawbah is a strange name. It&#39;s a foreign name.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, I see it here. We should have changed that to Arabic. Sorry about that. Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the next edition, I will change this Arabic name also to Bar&atilde;&#39;ah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes. I&#39;m sure there is some mathematical basis for it. That&#39;s a good question.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The names of the Suras were divinely inspired. This is why this is The Heifer (Al-Baqarah), for example, and not anything else.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even though there are many important subjects in this Sura. But if you look at the old books, all of them say &quot;Bar&atilde;&#39;ah,&quot; up to 100 years ago.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, this name Tawbah started to appear in less than 100-year-old books.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Any other questions? Well, let us... We&#39;re celebrating Apamea&#39;s birthday today.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Did she born in two days? Dr. Khalifa: Well, her birthday was in the middle of the week, so she gets two F&atilde;tehahs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: M&atilde; Sh&atilde; All&atilde;h Dr. Khalifa: Also, it&#39;s a good excuse to have some cake.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s nobody&#39;s birthday until...

God bless you. Very fortunate. You&#39;re a fortunate believer. M&atilde; Sh&atilde; All&atilde;h.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem In the name of GOD, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Congratulations for reading the Quran. And congratulations on starting with the new translation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I want to tell you right now that this was made obsolete before it came out of the press.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Which is a very great sign that we must be congratulated about. Because we are advancing faster than the press can work.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For example, you see, you see the title page, down this is &quot;Islamic Productions Tucson.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next edition, &quot;The United Submitters International, Tucson&quot;, for example, just to give you an idea of why this was obsolete before it came out of the press.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And throughout the translation, &quot;Islam&quot; would be &quot;Submission.&quot; And &quot;Muslim&quot; will be &quot;Submitter.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the translation will be universalized.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is not appropriate. This word, production, is not appropriate. Islam is Arabic. Production is English.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In Arabic, we call the Christian person Nasrani (&#1606;&#1614;&#1589;&#1618;&#1585;&#1614;&#1575;&#1606;&#1616;&#1610;) But when you say Christian productions, you don&#39;t say Nasrani productions. You say Christian productions. The whole thing is English.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Also, this is a stage. You can see that God wants to put the whole world to test.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When the miracle of the Quran appeared first, the title was &quot;The Perpetual Miracle of Muhammad.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was in Arabic &quot;(unintelligible) &#1605;&#1593;&#1580;&#1586;&#1577; &#1605;&#1581;&#1605;&#1583;&quot; And it was distributed as such.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I still have the labels as such, but the Arabs and the Muslims still do not understand the miracle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it is not the current excuse that Rashad Khalifa has gone crazy or whatever excuses they used are not true, are not accepted.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They don&#39;t... Even if they say &quot;we don&#39;t accept this miracle of the Quran because Rashad Khalifa is crazy.&quot; They cannot do that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because, initially, the miracle was titled &quot;The Miracle of Muhammad, The Perpetual Miracle of Muhammad&quot; which is true because it came through the Prophet Muhammad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God sent it to the world through the Prophet, in the Quran, and was there the whole time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And still the Arabs, as you see from the last issue, mainly the Arabs could not understand it, were not permitted to understand it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:18:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then, it progressed. God willed that it progresses and it became universalized. It became just (unintelligible) the miracle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it didn&#39;t matter how they accepted it or not. Same with the first translation and with this translation, they cannot say &quot;this is off&quot;, you see.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They can look on the spine of the book and it says &quot;Islamic Productions&quot; on there and also it says &quot;the Only Religion acceptable to God is Islam.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, just go flip a couple of pages, see &quot;proclaiming one religion for all the people.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you can see the translation in the first rectangle saying &quot;the Only Religion acceptable to God is Islam.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, even though it is very clearly in harmonizing with their language, you will note pretty soon that they don&#39;t accept this translation</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">because God wants to prove something, prove their defiance, regardless of... Even if you agree with them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:19:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because even if you agree with them and you present the truth to them of worshipping God alone and upholding the word of God alone, they&#39;re just not having it in their hearts.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And God will not allow them, does not permit them, as we read in many, many verses in the Quran. God does not permit them to accept the truth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In Sura 43, we&#39;re told that on the Day of Judgment, they will say to guardian of Hell &quot;Let your Lord finish us off.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the Guardian of Hell, the angel of Hell will tell them &quot;No, you&#39;re gonna stay like this forever.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We have brought the truth to you, we have presented the truth to you, but most of you hate the truth.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Which is true, they really hate the truth. It is something that was incomprehensible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How can people hate the truth? But it happens, they demonstrate it continuously, they hate the truth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they will hate anything to do with God, or anything to do with the truth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they want to stay away from it as far as possible. And this is documented in the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:20:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is why, I&#39;m just trying to explain to you why this was obsolete before it came out of the press.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s also, every step of this book, every step was guided by God. And we had many, many signs that we&#39;ll be talking about in the future, from now on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I want to share with you the last sign about this book.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was supposed to pick it up from the press on the 18th, Friday the 18th, which is the last day of the week.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this was done 50 days before that time. We submitted the originals and they put the schedule and it was scheduled to be released on the 18th, which is the end of the week.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the 17th, when I called, I said &quot;OK, I&#39;m coming to pick it up.&quot; They were very apologetic and they said they will work the weekend because the book will be finished on the 19th, which is a Saturday.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is another vital sign because there are so many departments.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As you see from the book, it&#39;s a big printer. It is the same printer that prints books for the University of Arizona Press and to some of the most famous universities around the country.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there are many departments and every department has its own problems and delays and so on, but the book was finished on the 19th.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And on the 19th, I was in Washington, D.C. and I was driving with Ihsan.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I just decided to be a tourist. So, I went out to the tourist areas, Lincoln Memorial, Washington Memorial, the Capitol and so on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we were just leaving Lincoln Memorial, driving back to Ihsan&#39;s house.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And all of a sudden, all the license plates... now this may be superstition, but God gives us messages through our superstitions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:22:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I want you to know this, too. From my experience, and probably you all had these experiences. If you were superstitious, for example, that if you wake up in the morning and see a butterfly</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">standing in the northern corner, northwest corner of your house, in the roof, this means you&#39;ll have a good day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ok. This is superstition. Then, God will speak to you through that superstition and you&#39;ll have a good day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If God wants to tell you so, He&#39;ll send you a butterfly in the northwest corner of the roof of your house. That&#39;s what you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So anyway, about 1 o&#39;clock on Saturday, 19th of August, and I was driving back from Lincoln Memorial, and all of a sudden</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">all the license plates around us, almost all of them were divisible by 19 on both sides people parked and in the cars parked on both sides.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it was really a very strange phenomenon. I&#39;ve never in my life seen so many divisible numbers of license plates.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I said &quot;what is going on? What is happening?&quot; I said &quot;what is this?&quot; And then we came to a street that is only about 6 or 7 blocks from Ihsan&#39;s house called Reed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The street, the name of the street is Reed. And in the corner is Perpetual Savings. We have also two people from Washington, D.C.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:23:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Do you know the area, Gale and Mobile? Perpetual Savings on Reed Street, and the first car in front of us that&#39;s gonna turn left is number 114.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I said &quot;this is it. The book is being finished now. So, I&#39;m gonna check with the press.&quot; I said &quot;this is it. It must be that the book is being finished now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And sure enough, when I went there, I said &quot;I&#39;m curious. When did you finish yesterday? You know, You worked on the weekend. I really appreciate it. What time did you finish?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, between 1 and 2 o&#39;clock.&quot; I said &quot;hmm, we knew that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, that was the last sign. So anyway, every step of this, when you find any typing errors or anything, you can be</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sure that they are designed by God, because God creates loopholes for the disbelievers who insist on going to Hell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so every step of this book was designed by God. And this fits in with Edip&#39;s Khutba today, by the way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:24:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you find any, already Emily found a minor mistake where I forgot to put Arabic, the Arabic word next to it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, all these things are guided by God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think it is in the beginning of Sura 7. I wanted... The first verse I wanted to look at in the new translation is in Sura 7 at the beginning, or 6.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">6 or 7. I&#39;m gonna find out exactly the Sura... the Sura and the verse number.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Give me just a second. I&#39;ll find it. Right. Yeah. Edip: Definitely.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Sura 6, verse 9. Ok? Let&#39;s read it together. Sura 6, verse 9.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:25:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The top of page 129. Subtitle is &quot;Requirements of the Test.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it says, [6:9] Had we sent an angel, we would have sent him in the form of a man, and we would have kept them just as confused as they are confused now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, that was Edip&#39;s Khutba today. God said &quot;Even if I sent an angel, I will send him in the form of a human being,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a goofy one, and confuse the heck out of them just as they are confused now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it is a requirement that God... number 10 says, [6:10] Messengers before you have been ridiculed. Those who mocked them had incurred the consequences of their ridiculing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s because the disbelievers God creates these loopholes for the disbelievers to perfect it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If God sends an angel, the whole world will believe. If there is an angel who is mighty and strange looking, has these powers and so on, what is the big deal? What is the test?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:26:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But we are fortunate in that sense that, that we are passing very difficult tests at very special times and I am passing them along with you</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and telling you because more than 90% of the time, I am required, just as you are</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to believe certain things that I did not know before in the past.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I know it is very difficult. In fact, I probably was the, the most lax of power among... there were many of you who may have more courage than me because for eight years I was a secret, a secret agent.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even now I can&#39;t bring out the word. So, it is just as difficult. I realize how difficult it is. So, congratulations to all of you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;re very... you&#39;re very fortunate people. Alhamdu Lillah. I know you know it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:27:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay, we&#39;ll just take the book from the cover. A woman: I have a question. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Oh, we planned it this way for a long time. No. That&#39;s another good sign, you know, cause</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Here, well, the first time we got hold of the new Quran, we were starting from the beginning of the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: ISBN. A woman: ISBN.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Oh, yeah. I see. Wow. Did you tell me this before? No, you already forgot it, but this is really something.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah. The ISBN number, this stands for International Standard Book Number.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it is a unique number that no other book in the world has it. So, I guess if you add 934894 plus 57 plus 1, you get a divisible number. We didn&#39;t plan it. We didn&#39;t design it this way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><h1 class="c5 c1 c4" id="h.4vnsyw489eet"><span class="c8">20 Quran Study From Behrouz 1020 Sura 3 By M Sabahi Insurance Fear Worry</span></h1><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: &#1571;&#1593;&#1608;&#1584; &#1576;&#1616;&#1649;&#1604;&#1604;&#1614;&#1617;&#1607;&#1616; &#1605;&#1616;&#1606;&#1614; &#1649;&#1604;&#1588;&#1614;&#1617;&#1610;&#1618;&#1591;&#1614;&#1600;&#1648;&#1606;&#1616; &#1649;&#1604;&#1585;&#1614;&#1617;&#1580;&#1616;&#1610;&#1605;&#1616; We seek refuge in God from Satan</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">0:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I ask God to keep him away from us.

And then, we go to the multiple-meaning verses, which in Arabic they say Mutishabihat (&#1605;&#1615;&#1578;&#1614;&#1588;&#1614;&#1600;&#1648;&#1576;&#1616;&#1607;&#1614;&#1600;&#1648;&#1578;&#1612;&#1773;).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These are verses that you can get confused or you can do the interpretation that you want to.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then, God explains that those who harbor doubts in their hearts will pursue the multiple-meaning</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">verses to create confusion and to seek different meanings. This is the most interesting part of it because myself at least being a Muslim and being raised in an</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Islamic environment, I can very easily, very soundly relate to this because this is</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">exactly what is happening. And we have felt it all throughout our lives, how these multiple-meaning verses</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">are becoming the essence of the scripture. And the essence of the scripture is put aside.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, you see all the time an effort that is put into &quot;understanding the Quran&quot; is devoted</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to the understanding of the multiple-meaning verses, the Mutishabihat (&#1605;&#1615;&#1578;&#1614;&#1588;&#1614;&#1600;&#1648;&#1576;&#1616;&#1607;&#1614;&#1600;&#1648;&#1578;&#1612;&#1773;).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then in that process, people completely forget about the essence of the major points of the scripture.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And with that they confuse the other people.

Thank God that now that I read the Quran, I find out that everything is here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, possessing or getting that knowledge only goes to the people who are, I use the Arabic,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rasikhuna Fil Elm (&#1585;&#1614;&#1617;&#1648;&#1587;&#1616;&#1582;&#1615;&#1608;&#1606;&#1614; &#1601;&#1616;&#1609; &#1649;&#1604;&#1618;&#1593;&#1616;&#1604;&#1618;&#1605;&#1616;) the ones who are seeking to find the answers and they are after finding the true meaning</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the Quran.

Look at the second half of the verse.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[3:7] ....No one knows their true meaning except God... Now in Quran, there is no full stops, comma, these kind of things or quotation mark.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, let&#39;s try to understand the puzzle or the multi-meaning of this verse.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No one knows their true meaning except God. Put full stop there now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then end, make it capital. Look at the meaning, just change the opposite.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No one knows... according to them, they stop in God. They say &quot;no one knows their true meaning except God.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Stop. &quot;And those who possess knowledge, they say we believe in this.&quot; According to them, those who possess knowledge, they cannot understand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because they full stop in God. And I discussed on this subject with them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I said &quot;according to you, if you stop in God, the meaning just change in opposite.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But if you don&#39;t stop, if you pass, the meaning just opposite. Somebody can understand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And what is your proof that you have to stop there?&quot; They said &quot;there is no proof but many &#39;Alim, many scholars agree on this subject.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Okay, now do you confess that this verse has two meanings, depends on your stop?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you stop on God, nobody will know.

That means this verse is by itself multi-meaning verse.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And do you claim that you know this verse? According to you, nobody knows multi-meaning verses.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, you say this verse by itself has a multi-meaning. And that means, according to you, you contradict with yourself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You cannot claim that you know the meaning of this verse. You cannot speak on this verse.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this was a very good discussion but I don&#39;t know how could I reflect to you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I want to give some examples because by examples it may be clarified.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For example, word Rasul, messenger, in Quran has multi-meaning.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One is, you can use this for prophets, also for messengers that don&#39;t receive books.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they manipulate, they try to change the meaning of these words, Rasul (messenger) and Nabi (prophet).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And also, for example, word Nafs has double meaning, has three meanings in Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nafs, soul, yourself or your ego. For example, just in the beginning, they fail in the meaning of these multi-meaning words.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Words, For example, chapter 2 verse 50? Dr. Khalifa: 54</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: 54, they say...

Dr. Khalifa: First thing, Behrouz tells Naghmeh, he met her.

Dr. Sabahi: I think the cricket stopped him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: He stole the show. Dr. Sabahi: One thing that I can add to what Edip said. If we look at 2:146, God says,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[2:146] Those who received the scripture recognize the truth herein, just as they recognize their own children. However, some of them conceal the truth, knowingly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And 147, Sura 2, [2:147] This is the truth from your Lord; do not harbor any doubt it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, that could help to understand that people who can, have possessed the knowledge,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">who can gain that knowledge. Everybody can do it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And who you know better than anybody else, hopefully your children. Okay, if there is no... question?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Douglas: In the Arabic text, there is a Wa, which means &quot;and.&quot; But it&#39;s written very small.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: No, no, no.

Douglas: They ignore the Wa (and). Douglas: You see, the reason why I raised the question is because we are told in the Quran that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the people who are misguided, the unbelievers, that Allah will cause them to see what they wanna see in the verses.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they will, they will, in their minds, say that the Wa (and) is not present.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I think that&#39;s critical.

I don&#39;t think it was clear. What I, what I was referring to is that the Wa (and), it shows how Satan can misguide one letter in the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One letter, the Wa, which means and, in their minds, in their perceptions, it has no significance, and that&#39;s what I meant.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That they can be misguided. Satan can misguide them with one letter, let alone a word.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Exactly, this is the case with the washing the feet or wiping the feet. One letter that decides that the feet should be washed. And they ignore that letter which is</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">wipe the...

You know, just talk to Him, ask Him, and remind yourself of Him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These are what these two verses are.

And it has always happened.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t know it. Now that I look back and see the things or the adventures or the situations that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">myself and my family have gone through, we have been in places and situations that only God could have</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">helped us to be able to stay out of trouble or things in that region. So,...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I think this is when God says that they saw them as twice as many with their own eyes,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it should be referring to a specific incident in history. I don&#39;t know what it is.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But was there a war or something that happened, which Rashad can tell us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: This is... Dr. Sabahi: [3:15] &quot;....approval.&quot; GOD is Seer of His worshipers. These allegorical flowing streams and pure spouses that are used in here,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">usually flowing streams are something that in nature, wherever you go, you see that it&#39;s beautiful.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s just something that reminds you of the beauty of a place.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And pure spouses, I guess, I don&#39;t wanna go too far into this one, specific.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But again, this is a human nature that this is what people want.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, God is using this. It&#39;s not telling us that you&#39;ll have a lot of water, H2O, and a lot of women or men over</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in the Heaven. But to tell you how beautiful it is if you get there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And at the end, God says &quot;God is Seer of His worshippers.&quot; So, if you worship God alone, He is the One who sees it all.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These people who are worshipping God alone, [3:16] They say, &quot;Our Lord, we have believed. Forgive us our sins, and spare us the agony of hellfire.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is something that we should always remind ourselves to say and ask God for the sins</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that we have committed in the past or may commit every day to be, be forgiven.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And God is Merciful, Gracious, and He is the Forgiver. If you are sincere in your asking God and God is the Knower of what is in your heart,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">then you&#39;ll see the result.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then in 17, God very clearly, God is describing those worshippers, those believers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;They are the steadfast.&quot; [3:17] They are steadfast, truthful,... They don&#39;t lie. They are truthful.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[3:17] ...submitting, charitable, meditators at dawn. which includes the Salat,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">which includes the Zakat, which includes that you are submitting yourself to God alone and you are steadfast at what you are doing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You don&#39;t... I use the word vacillate, or you don&#39;t go back and forth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You are steadfast in what you believe and what you practice. I&#39;ll stop at here and, as they say, open the floor for discussion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Any questions? Dr. Khalifa: I want to go to what you mentioned about no grief and no worry, no grief, and no fear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Rashad Khalifa explains topic of no &ldquo;Insurance&rdquo; can take years to come round. &ldquo;No grief and no Fear&rdquo;. Earth provides &ldquo;food for the prisoners&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, this seems to come up every time we do a Quranic study, as you noticed, because it is very difficult for us,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the human nature, it is very difficult for us to come through with this full confidence in God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I&#39;ve noticed it over many, many years with many, many believers. They eventually come around.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it&#39;s very difficult to talk them out of insurance, for example. They just don&#39;t have that confidence. It takes a long time to grasp that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is also, it takes a long time to use this criterion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No grief and no fear. So, I want you to listen to me. I&#39;m gonna repeat it again since God repeats in the whole Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it seems to float over our heads. So, just for the moment, including myself, I want to imagine that this is for you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don&#39;t let anybody or your companion tells you &quot;this is for somebody else.&quot; &quot;It is not for me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I want you to, this is directed to you. If you have, if you grieve, grieve over anything you missed,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">or if you&#39;re worried about anything in the future, you are not in God&#39;s dominion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You have to apply this criterion to yourself. So, ask yourself if you heard me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m gonna repeat it. If you&#39;re grieving over anything you missed, or if you&#39;re worried about anything in the future, you are not in God&#39;s dominion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, for heaven&#39;s sake, find out what is it that is grieving you because you missed something, you lost something.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or what is it that is causing you to worry about the future. Find out what it is, get rid of it, get back into God&#39;s dominion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A believer, a criterion of the believer is no grief and no fear. You don&#39;t have any grief. You don&#39;t have any fear.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Whatever situation you&#39;re in, you tell God &quot;Okay God, I&#39;m a submitter. I accept whatever you have given me, cheerfully.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And underline &quot;cheerfully.&quot; Because God knows best. If you go apply for a job and you don&#39;t get it, you don&#39;t grieve, you understand that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">this is, God doesn&#39;t want this for you for some reasons that God knows. He sees the roads ahead of you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And He will pick out the road that is best for you. So, you must have that confidence in God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And He runs everything. Remember verse 5, it says,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[3:5] Nothing is hidden from GOD,... It&#39;s a very black statement. [3:5] Nothing is hidden from GOD,...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Including minor affairs. And God guarantees the believers. The believers are God&#39;s people. They&#39;re in His domain.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And God is the Sovereign of the universe. And He sees to it that you have no grief and no worry.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, if you have that, you&#39;re not in God&#39;s dominion. So, He lures you to find out why.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The second part I want to touch here is number 14. It says,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[3:14] Adorned for the people are the material things of this world,... Now, I want to remind you. I have an article by a good believer that I may put in the Perspective.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s in my desk. And she describes us as prisoners of war.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We declared war on God billions of years ago. We are the bad creatures.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We are the rebels. We have been banished from God&#39;s kingdom out here. But we are having a chance.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is halfway house to Heaven from Hell. And the pleasures we have in this world are the things that are given to the prisoners of war.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, can you imagine the things that are for the good creatures in Heaven? I mean, these are, you know, the lobster and the steak and the filet mignon and the shrimp</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and the apples and the bananas and the peaches. These are the food for the prisoners.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they are adored for the people. There was another verse where it says that &quot;the disbelievers mock and ridicule the believers.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because they&#39;re having these things. But in the Hereafter, it&#39;s gonna be the other way around.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because these things that we have here, all these pleasures and good things, are ridiculous compared to the Hereafter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just think. This is the food for the prisoners of war. We send our best people, the astronauts, in space, and we give them food that you will not give your dog.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Right, Lydia? Lydia: Right. Dr. Khalifa: So, it&#39;s adored in the eyes of the people. And this...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have to remember this. And God says in 15,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[3:15] &quot;Let me inform you of something that is far better:... Also at the end of verse 14, &quot;God possesses a far better abode.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Far better. These are the things for the rebels.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Can you imagine that somebody declares war on you, and you catch him as a captain, put him in prison. What kind of food will you give him?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Are you gonna cook your best food? Your best food? A man: Dog. Dr. Khalifa: Huh? A man: Dog.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Right. Dr. Khalifa: You give him dog food.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Except dogs are far better than we are. The new movie is called &quot;All dogs go to Heaven.&quot; Have you seen that?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hollywood is learning, reading the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Are there any questions on this? A man: Yes, I have a suggestion. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Farhad: This verse 15, as you said before that, you know, they choose, you know, the verse, you know, beating your wife, and</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the disbelievers choose on that and they try to mock you. Farhad: This also has been a tool at the hand of disbelievers. Dr. Khalifa: Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Farhad: You know, telling you that, you know, &quot;Oh, God promises you many spouses in the Heaven. Farhad: God promises you rivers full of honey and milk in the Heaven. What is this?&quot; Dr. Khalifa: That&#39;s right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Allegorical description of Heaven.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Farhad: That&#39;s mocking Dr. Khalifa: Right. Dr. Khalifa: Because this is close to verse 7, where the multiple-meaning verse is.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The allegorical descriptions. Because if you, if you want to describe your wedding night to a child that is 5 years old, 7 years old, how would you describe that?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You have to give the child the allegorical description. Say &quot;like eating candy.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right? I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree that your wedding night is a little better than eating candy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But this is how you approximate it to the child because the child will never understand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, I find this is as the best example. Because it&#39;s something that only adults will appreciate.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The children can never comprehend. Edip: Rashad, (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: So, the same with Heaven.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s something that you can never comprehend. There&#39;s no way God can describe to you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a matter of fact, this is why if you go to Sura 55 when God speaks to the humans and the jinns,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God says &quot;there&#39;s Heaven for the humans and Heaven for the jinns.&quot; Because for the humans, they like steak and McDonald&#39;s.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, I mean... Depends on how old we are. But the jinns don&#39;t give a hoot about these things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, if God says &quot;Heaven is this and this.&quot; The jinns &quot;Oh, we are not interested.&quot; So, the Heaven&#39;s description is allegorical. Edip, you had a good idea.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Oh yes, I had other example, not so interesting.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Ok. The other example is this, Rashad. Edip: If you... Dr. Khalifa: Don&#39;t be embarrassed. Edip: Yeah, I...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: What is your allegory? Edip: If you can communicate with a baby in mother&#39;s belly, for example, doesn&#39;t know this earth, this world, anything,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he knows only very little space and he doesn&#39;t know light, also ocean and all this kind of anything that we have.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For example, if you want to describe that baby and this world, how can you describe?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can describe about only the things that he knows, very limited things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, you can even go back 4 generations and describe to your grandfather the TV.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Yes. Dr. Sabahi: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: And if he has a baseball bat, he will use it on you. He would think you&#39;re kidding, you&#39;re mocking him, and ridiculing him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If somebody&#39;s sitting in Washington, I mean, watching this in Tucson. I mean, this is something real. This is something that we have now. Just go back 4 generations, try to describe that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We&#39;re talking about Heaven which is billions of light years from here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Notice, all Tucson is what, 20 miles and 100 years from town? Heaven is billions of light years from town. Try to describe that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Sabahi: Martha has a question. Martha: (unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I&#39;m just wondering that it might not be possible to state that (unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For me, it&#39;s like (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that I haven&#39;t understood.

Get Aisha take her to the babysitter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Ok. Excuse me. Dr. Sabahi: ...got a chance to leave the country, our country, and go to</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to Africa, and over there, I guess, they took him to a place that these tribes lived, and these tribes</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">didn&#39;t have anything on. They just were naked. So, this gentleman comes back and says</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">this is the true, the true life. This is what it should be, and these are the people</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">who force women to cover their hair, and, you know, they are so picky about how the women dress, but</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he hasn&#39;t seen anything outside where he was. He goes and sees it and now he says &quot;wow that&#39;s the right way to do it, not the way we do it.&quot; But still they don&#39;t wanna do it that way in our country.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it doesn&#39;t take to be a baby not to know what is going on in the world. Ok, I go back to verse 18, the first pillar of Islam, God first witnessed</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The First Pillar of Islam* [3:18] GOD bears witness that there is no god except He, and so do the angels and those who possess knowledge.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Again, who possess knowledge. About people who possess knowledge. [3:18] ....He is the absolute god; there is no god except He, the Almighty, the Wise.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[3:19] The only religion approved by GOD is &quot;Islam.&quot; Those who received the scripture dispute this fact, knowingly. This is due to jealousy on their part. For those who reject GOD&#39;s revelations, GOD is most strict in reckoning.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">20, [3:20] If they argue with you, then say, &quot;I have submitted myself to GOD; Me and those who follow me.&quot; And say to those who received the scripture, as well as those who did not receive any scripture, &quot;Do you accept Islam as your religion?&quot; If they do accept Islam, then they are guided. If they turn away, then your sole mission is to deliver the message. GOD is Seer of all the people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I go back to 18. I remember last time I asked the question &quot;how many times this sentence</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;there is no god except He&quot; is repeated in Quran?&quot; Up to that point, there was two. And right away in this verse, there are two more of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know how many more are after it. But clearly, God is telling us</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">who are the ones who are able to say &quot;La Elaha Ella Allah.&quot; There is no god except He,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and don&#39;t add anything after it. He says &quot;the angels, God Himself&quot; is bearing witness to the fact</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and then in addition to God, &quot;the angels, and the people who possess the knowledge.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Again, the same thing that was in verse 7.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, these are the, these are the only people who can say this, this sentence without adding or subtracting anything from it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;He is the Absolute God.&quot; Again, &quot;there is no god except He, the Almighty, the Wise.&quot; And two of</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the names of God, the Almighty and the Wise are after it. So, this is a very strong verse, clearly,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">showing that there is no god except He, and for the believers and people who possess knowledge, this is the main pillar of Islam.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have one question myself. In the translation of &quot;He is the absolute god&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the reason is that I read the Farsi book, that&#39;s... I think it&#39;s the translation for Qaiman Bilqisti (&#1602;&#1614;&#1570;&#1574;&#1616;&#1605;&#1611;&#1762;&#1575; &#1576;&#1616;&#1649;&#1604;&#1618;&#1602;&#1616;&#1587;&#1618;&#1591;&#1616;)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">which they have translated or interpreted, either literally or interpretation, that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;He is the God that spreads the justice.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;He is the one, the Just. And He is the one who</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the justice is in His own hands. And He is the one who makes sure that justice is done all over the world.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">which is translated &quot;He is the absolute god.&quot; I just wanted to see what is... what...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Well, I think I wanted it to mean justly and fairly and truthfully, He is the only god.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is the only one that is truthfully and honestly and justly, equitably and fairly the one God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Sabahi: So again, the difference is that you translate this as, as describing what that god is. La Elaha Ella Allah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: There&#39;s the whole verse (unintelligible). Dr. Sabahi: Yeah. Yeah. Dr. Sabahi: Ok. Ok. Dr. Sabahi: It&#39;s not saying any other attribute of God except that. In other words, for example, Satan wanted to be a god,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">but it&#39;s not fair for Satan to be a god. It&#39;s not just, because he doesn&#39;t... he&#39;s not worthy of godhood.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God is the only one who is worthy of godhood. That&#39;s what this verse says. Dr. Sabahi: Ok. Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible) Edip</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: Can be Qaiman Bilqist (&#1602;&#1614;&#1570;&#1574;&#1616;&#1605;&#1611;&#1762;&#1575; &#1576;&#1616;&#1649;&#1604;&#1618;&#1602;&#1616;&#1587;&#1618;&#1591;) an attribute of Ulul Ilmi (&#1571;&#1615;&#1608;&#1759;&#1604;&#1615;&#1608;&#1575;&#1759; &#1649;&#1604;&#1618;&#1593;&#1616;&#1604;&#1618;&#1605;&#1616;)? They judge very correctly judgement. They have correctly judgment.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: No, this is referring to God. Qaiman Bilqist (&#1602;&#1614;&#1570;&#1574;&#1616;&#1605;&#1611;&#1762;&#1575; &#1576;&#1616;&#1649;&#1604;&#1618;&#1602;&#1616;&#1587;&#1618;&#1591;). Qaiman (&#1602;&#1614;&#1570;&#1574;&#1616;&#1605;&#1611;&#1762;&#1575;) is God. Bilqist (&#1576;&#1616;&#1649;&#1604;&#1618;&#1602;&#1616;&#1587;&#1618;&#1591;) means truthfully, and honestly, justly, He is the only God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or the only one worthy of godhood. So, I translated it as absolute god.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Sabahi: Ok.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And 19, [3:19] The only religion approved by GOD is &quot;Islam.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And as you know [3:19] ...Those who received the scripture dispute this fact, knowingly.

You lose the point.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God is telling us that you have to give them the message, and tell them that this is what I think,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">this is what I believe, which is directly from this Quran. I&#39;m not making up anything on my own.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is what it is in this Quran. If they accepted it, that&#39;s fine.

God is saying that &quot;if they turn away, then your sole mission is to deliver the message.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because God is the one who leads the people to righteousness or to disbelieving.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And my personal experience is that when you get to such an argument,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">usually the other people that talk to you, they pull you towards things are not the major issues.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They try to bring out the minor issues, and then if you play in their</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ballgame, then you get lost into petty arguments, arguments, not the point that you wanna</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">raise and that&#39;s delivering the message that &quot;this is what I believe, and my belief is in Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And one thing that I remember once we asked here from Rashad</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">about this point, that whether I can label someone as &quot;you are a disbeliever.&quot; There is another verse, we&#39;ll get to it, IN SHAA ALLAH,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that &quot;don&#39;t take friends among the disbelievers.&quot; How can I decide whether this guy is a believer or not?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If he says that &quot;I am a disbeliever,&quot; that&#39;s fine. But if you don&#39;t know, he thinks that he is a believer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What was said that night was that any time, any day, God is the one who is</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is capable of leading a person to righteousness or averting him from righteousness.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, any day that can happen to someone. And I have seen it, even in the short period of time that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have been exposed to the true Quran and have been reading it. So,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you have to be very patient. We have to be very patient. And we have to always keep in mind that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the sole mission is to deliver the message whether they take heed or they don&#39;t, whether they reject it or not,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Spreading the message, Gradual release of the Miracle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that is something that God is Seer of all the people. And He is the one who does it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I stop here and leave it for discussions or questions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: May I ask a question? What is responsibility of a believer? For example, I wanna compare a Muslim with the Christians and other sects.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can see Christian missionaries go in the heart of Africa and spread the Christianity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For example, right now in the places that war is going on in Nicaragua, right?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You will see, you know, all these nuns that they are in the heart of the war. But I don&#39;t hear a Muslim doing that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And over here, you read that &quot;do not argue.&quot; What is my responsibility to spread the word of God? How can I spread it to other people?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Just telling, actually, there&#39;s the sole way of saying to the... say to those to...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Sabahi: Yeah, you sole mission is... A woman: Where is the &quot;reminding?&quot; Dr. Khalifa: 20, it says [3:20] If they argue with you, then say, &quot;I have submitted myself to GOD; Me and those who follow me.&quot; And say to those who received the scripture, as well as those who did not receive any scripture, &quot;Do you accept Islam as your religion?&quot; If they do accept Islam, they have been guided. If they turn away, then your sole mission is to deliver the message. GOD is Seer of all the people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Do you invite other people, you know, to your religion and if they don&#39;t accept...? Dr. Khalifa: We deliver, we deliver the message all over the world. There are believers everywhere.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they&#39;re believer in the message wherever they are. Keikhosrow is doing it in Atlanta and Behrooz did it in his area.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he made the summary of the miracle and he delivered them to the mathematics department known college and university in the area and he went to the churches.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He wrote to the churches to 100,000 people all over us. In fact, he did, he carried out this verse correctly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have people in Australia, New Zealand, England, doing this. They&#39;re very active.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wherever they are, it&#39;s... you can&#39;t help it. When you see a miracle like this, you see a treasure and you want the people to partake of it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;re telling them everywhere. And of course, they are being ridiculed and... they&#39;re getting believers. Ihsan did it in Washington. Kathy did it in Atlanta.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She went to all the churches and she was shocked. They&#39;re not interested, are they?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah, before she came here. So, she gave up in Atlanta and said &quot;I&#39;m going to Tucson,&quot; where she is.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the believers do that. They deliver the message. And then, that&#39;s all they can do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Robert Nadib sat at the university in the morning and delivered the message to a number of people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edip: And Apamea.

A man: I have a simple observation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In communicating the truth to people, naturally we need to be equipped</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with tools.

This is a very good point. I want to mention here that God wanted this message</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to come here gradually. Even the miracle of Quran, at the beginning, it was titled &quot;the perpetual miracle of Muhammad.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they still rejected it. They still turned it down, because God wants to tell them and show them on the Day of Judgement that even when it was called &quot;the perpetual miracle of Muhammad,&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they could not see it. And because of their arrogance, they would not accept it. Also, the Quran now says &quot;the only religion acceptable to God is Isalm.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Islam was given a bad name by thanks to Khomeini and Gaddafi and Islamic revolutionaries.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the new, in the final and official translation that I&#39;m doing now, and IN SHAA ALLAH that&#39;s the one that will be printed by the millions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It says &quot;the only religion approved by God is submission.&quot; And &quot;Muslim&quot; will be changed to &quot;Submitter.&quot; The &quot;Muslim Perspective&quot; has been changed to Submitter&#39;s Perspective.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But we are delivering the message.

Farhad talked to his sister and Mahvash talked to her brother and they hit the jackpot.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Both of them believed.

In other words, if you&#39;re a believer, you must trust that God will take care of you. God guarantees it for you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">0:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if something appears to be bad, &nbsp;you must know that there&#39;s a good reason for it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">0:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[9:52] Say, &quot;you can only expect for us &nbsp;one of two good things in war (victory &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">0:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">or martyrdom) while we expect for you condemnation from GOD and retribution from Him,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">0:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">at our hands... or at our hands. Therefore, wait, and we will wait along with you.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">0:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[9:53] Say, &ldquo;Spend, willingly or unwillingly.

[9:54] What prevented the acceptance of their spending is that they disbelieved in GOD and His messenger, and when they observed the Contact Prayers (Salat), they observed them lazily, and when they gave to charity, they did so grudgingly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is an important verse. You should remember it, 9:54. Remember it. When the people tell you that &quot;we &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">think that Salat began with Muhammad. We think there was no Salat before the Prophet Muhammad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You should remind them with this verse. These &nbsp;are people who rejected the Prophet. They disbelieved in God, but they were doing the 5 contact prayers. The word Salat is very specific.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because Salat existed before the prophet. Just at the time, it had been... they had been corrupted &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">by idol worship.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Exactly. Same thing today. 9:54 is another proof that the contact prayers (Salat) existed before the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, this is a good point because this, this verse was revealed probably less than a year before the prophet&#39;s death.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is my chance to give Parivash a public apology because I misunderstood</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">her question yesterday.

So, it was not in existence really.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">2:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even when the Prophet died, they left the Quran in the &nbsp;chronological sequence with instructions in &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the side was... is not organized at all into a Quran.

Yet, nobody was allowed to &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">make any discovery in this miracle except those &nbsp;who are connected with with us, connected with...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to believers, only believers who believe like we do. They believe in worshipping God alone and upholding the word of</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God alone. Just look at the people made discoveries. I wanna pass this around. Just do it very</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fast. Just take one and pass on to the next.... This is a summary of the miracle in one page. When you look on the back and there are other &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">features of the miracle, you&#39;ll see that the first verse is 19 letters. The number of Suras is 114, 19 x 6.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is this simple enough? The first verse is 19 letters. The number of Suras is a multiple of 19. Rachel, the first revelation was 19 words.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The last revelation 19 words. These are famous first revelations and famous last revelations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they are very simple. They don&#39;t require a computer. But not a &nbsp;single person outside the fold of believers</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was allowed to touch it. It&#39;s a monopoly. You look at the &nbsp;people who made major discoveries, Abdullah,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mahmud, Ihsan, Lisa, many others, Feroz, Ismail. These are the people that we know. And they are all... Gatut.... they&#39;re</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">all people who firmly believe like we do. And for a long time, I was surprised why doesn&#39;t &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">anybody else find these things, you know? Because &nbsp;I needed some support. That&#39;s very simple.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When you look at the back, you see how simple it is. From the missing BISMILLAH to the extra BISMILLAH</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">19 Suras. Is this difficult? I mean, the consistency in repetition of the number 19, it&#39;s so simple.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet, nobody, a billion Muslims in the world but none of &nbsp;them was allowed to find these very simple facts &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">unless they upheld the Quran alone. They believed in Hadith and Sunnah and mentioned other names</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in their prayer. They are not permitted to touch it. This is verse &nbsp;77. By the way on the wall, you&#39;ll see a very &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">complex miracle, in the circle. This was, it&#39;s no &nbsp;longer the biggest number in the world because this is</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">already obsolete. Abdullah, on his birthday &nbsp;yesterday, made it obsolete. In this circle,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the number begins with the first verse in the Quran, 1. So, if you look on the left, there&#39;s an asterisk on the left</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">side of the circle and you see right... you start by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. these are the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">verses in the first Sura. 7 verses followed by &nbsp;the total number of verses in the Sura which is 7.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, you move on to the next Sura, 1 2 3 4 5 6 all the way to 286, &nbsp; the number of verses in Sura 2. When you put the total number &nbsp;of verses in Sura two, 286 and you do this all the way to the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">end of the Quran. When you get to the end of the Quran, if you look on the right side, you see this big &nbsp; arrow that says &quot;total number of verses in the Quran&quot;, you put that. Now, you have a very long number that is... I like &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it in the (unintelligible). It is 1 kilometer long. And it consists of 12,696 digits. And it is a multiple of 19.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you go on, if you see now, if you look on the right &nbsp;side of the circle in the middle of it with &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the big arrow that says &quot;total number of verses in the Quran.&quot; After the asterisk comes the total number of</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">verses in the first Sura which is 7. And next to it is the &nbsp;seven verses 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, you put the total number of verses in Sura &nbsp;number 2 and so on. So, what we&#39;re doing in &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the lower half is we are reversing the position of &nbsp;the total number of verses (unintelligible) at the end of &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">every Sura. We&#39;re putting this in the beginning of every Sura. And brothers and sisters, the number is divisible and go to</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the end. So, now this is a circle and connect the &nbsp;two numbers. We have what was until yesterday,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the day before yesterday, the longest number in the world, 25388</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">digits. And that&#39;s a multiple 19. Now, what &nbsp;Abdullah did to make this number obsolete,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he added the number of ever Sura. Okay, let&#39;s go now to the asterisk from the left side in the circle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It begins with the numbers in the first Sura, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">followed by the total number of verses in this Sura which is 7. Now, between the two 7s there, he put the</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">number of the Sura, 1. And he did this with every Sura and you get this, the number is still divisible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s just incredible. And there&#39;s more. If you put &nbsp;the number of the Sura at the beginning or at the</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">end or in the middle, it&#39;s still divisible. So, this &nbsp;would be in the Ramadan issue. In the Muslim Perspective, you&#39;re gonna</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">get more, more of the details. So, now I don&#39;t know &nbsp;how many digits there are from the first Sura to the last Sura, the numbers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">1 2 3 4, you counted the digits? 114. Sura 1, Sura 2, Sura 3, Sura 4, all the way to Sura 114. How many digits? 472, you add that...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">OK. This... there&#39;s a by-the-way miracle, you know. 1 2 3 4 all the way to the end of the Quran 114, and you put the digits next to each other. 474 digits</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and it&#39;s a multiple of 19. So, you... you put that, you add this to this number which is 25698 digits,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you add 474, now you have the biggest number &nbsp; in the world. It came out of this Quran. 2 4 25 388 plus 1... about. 25800 numbers, digits and that is divisible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the middle meaning between the last verse and the total number of verses. If you look on &nbsp; the left side of the circle, you see the asterisk &nbsp;and above it, you see the number of verses in Sura Al-F&atilde;tehah,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">number one. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 followed by the total number of verses</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in the Sura which is another set. So, he put the 1 between the two 7s that you see there. That&#39;s the number of the Sura and you do this in all the Suras, it&#39;s divisible. If you move the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">number of the Sura, put it at the beginning, so you have 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that&#39;s divisible. And if you put the total number &nbsp;of verses at the beginning, so you have 1 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you still have a divisible number. So, it is.... it sounds like almost a physical impossibility but it locks... it locks &nbsp;every verse... somebody called today and said</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;how do you know it&#39;s only the two verses in Sura 9?&quot; You notice the Sura 9</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is mentioned here. If you look in the upper right corner of the circle, it says total number of verses in Sura 9.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It has to be 127. This fellow was calling from Louisville, Kentucky and he said &quot;how do you know it&#39;s know only &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the two verses in Sura 9 that violate &nbsp;the code?&quot; So, I thought it was every single verse what we see &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">here is every single verse in Quran is authenticated as Divine from God, every single one, except these two.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it&#39;s just it is fitting to mention why God swears by the position of the stars &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that this is a.... this is a Quran KARIM. By the way, AL-QURAN AL-KARIM has a gematrical value that is 684, a multiple of 19,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the numerical value of this... the official name of the Quran, AL-QURAN AL-KARIM.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just to change the subject to make it a little bit lighter. You know how they count the stars? Just some of you do. But any way, they go out</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in the night and take a picture of the sky, just take a picture and they put in the computer and</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they count... the computer will count the number of the stars in that area in the picture and there&#39;s a formula that tells you what the circumference</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from the inside of a circle is and then you can... you &nbsp;can tell from this picture how many are in the &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">whole circumference of the whole sky and you do &nbsp;this a hundred times and then you take the average of &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a hundred times and you have exactly, almost &nbsp;exactly, the number of stars, a billion trillion of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And these are the ones that we see. Because of this... our Sun is in the next galaxy, you will not be able to see it because it is one of the dim stars.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What we&#39;re seeing are only &nbsp;the bright stars.

There are no exceptions. You don&#39;t get a scratch or a headache without something you have done.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it behooves you to find out what it is that you have done.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">3:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don&#39;t defend yourself either.

But we&#39;re supposed to do this ourselves.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have to find out what did I do wrong. But if I, if I&#39;m too egotistic to pinpoint what I did wrong, then I just go on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because the punishment will continue until you know what it is. When you know what it is and you repent, it never happens again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The problem is solved. So an utmost submitter means no problems of any kind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s almost unbelievable. But you see, God taught us repeatedly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">4:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God used me as a guinea pig, a happy guinea pig.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Dr. Rashad Khalifa talks of a personal experience &ndash; demonstrated perfect happiness. Edip doubts perfect happiness.

And the reason I&#39;m saying this is because Ihsan is sitting here, and she expected a big problem.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thank you. I had... I was busy with this translation, and I slept here three nights in a row. I didn&#39;t go home for three days.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then, the answering machine... the telephone rang, the answering machine came on. My wife was on the phone. This is Stephanie. So, Ihsan started to run away.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She said &quot;this is it.&quot; She&#39;s gonna divorce you. You&#39;re finished. This is it. A big fight.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, as she was approaching this door here to run away, she heard her say &quot;I made a batch of Italian cookies, but they were so delicious.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m sorry we finished all of them. So, I&#39;m gonna make you another batch.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She couldn&#39;t believe it. She, until now, she can&#39;t believe it. But this is... God manipulates the minds and the hearts of the people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, this happened again when three or four weeks ago... Huh? A few days ago when this visit.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I slept here two nights in a row. And she called.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What did she say this time? What did she want?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No, say it again. What did... I want to chat. I forget what she wanted, but it was peaceful. She was also running away.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, yes, yes, yes. She said &quot;I&#39;m the happiest person in the world.&quot; I said &quot;what?&quot; Now, now I, I was insulted.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Ok. Wait a minute.&quot; Honest, this is what she said. Yes, I remember now. She said &quot;I&#39;m the happiest person in the world.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I said &quot;what&#39;s happened?&quot; She said &quot;I found the car I&#39;ve been looking for, for a long time.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m like a baby. I&#39;m like a child who found a toy.&quot; This is exactly what she said.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She&#39;s been looking for a car.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I mean, this is a situation that warrants a problem, right, with most people. &quot;Where have you been?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re a half hour late.&quot; &quot;If you left your office at 2:30, you should have been here at 3 o&#39;clock.

Talk of disbelieving family members.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is it. God&#39;s law.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You have to realize that there is an admission test.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the admission test is very exacting, very exacting.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s usually in the first five years after you claim that you&#39;ve come to worship God alone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It doesn&#39;t mean it will last five years. Don&#39;t be scared. It comes within the... If you&#39;re proven to be a total submitter completely in the first month, then it is over.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But you must realize it happens. And all the while, you&#39;re in God&#39;s hands. The test is very tough.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where is Mahmoud?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Did he leave? Yes, so, he&#39;s going to take his car. Mahmoud is undergoing a test like this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He temporarily lost his wife, his kids, his cars, his computers. And he&#39;s very cheerful as you see. But it&#39;s all temporary.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everything will be restored and twice as much. He knows that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&#39;s a good believer. And we know that. But what I wanna say is that when you have a problem, you understand, you must understand the root of the problem. What is it?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why am I having this problem? So, if you&#39;re not in the admission test, then you did something wrong.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the admission test, simply, you say that you&#39;re gonna worship God alone, and Satan says otherwise.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, &quot;Behrouz doesn&#39;t mean it. He&#39;s just saying that.&quot; And God tells him &quot;OK, you can go and beat him up, but within a limit. You cannot do this and this to him.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, Satan starts on Behrouz, beats him up, gives him backache, a few other problems.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it doesn&#39;t fear Behrouz. He continues to worship God alone. Then, he&#39;s proven to be worshiping God alone. Then, all the blessings open up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just, just watch.

But I don&#39;t think...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think your cold and fever will go away as soon as you&#39;re convinced that that was wrong.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You do that. Just a little principle, a reminder from God to us to make everything right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But this is a common... By the way, this is a common thing that I went through and everybody goes through</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that we feel for our grandparents and so on. They were, they were all nice people. We loved them very much.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And our wishful thinking tells us &quot;maybe, they didn&#39;t know or their intention were good&quot; and so on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: But we have come to know because you have come in our time.

Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, but this is fine, but you cannot generalize it to the population.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you know a person personally and you see very well that he is worthy of Heaven, he probably did go to Heaven.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Probably God understood his situation. I&#39;m sure, not probably, I&#39;m sure God understood his situation. But we cannot generalize this and we cannot sympathize with that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for our own good because if I say &quot;maybe, these people had good intentions&quot; and we defend them, Satan will capitalize on that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He says &quot;see, he or she is defending the idol worshippers.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: I got a terrible headache yesterday because I was questioning this (unintelligible) about the... Dr. Khalifa: Yes, the case of the first cousin. I&#39;m glad, I&#39;m glad you knew that, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is a good example, actually. And 99.9%, this is exactly the connection.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: (unintelligible.) Then, I started to understand. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: And it&#39;s wonderful to know that, because you probably never again question the wisdom of the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: I didn&#39;t mean to, but the way I sounded, I probably... Dr. Khalifa: Yes, exactly. It is the way it sounds.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You see, Mrs. Amirali was perfectly innocent when she was talking about those past generations. But Satan will take that innocent statement and then make a big mountain out of it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He will actually say &quot;she is defending the idol worshippers.&quot; And there is a law in the Quran that you do not defend idol worshippers, even if they were your parents, your... and so on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Remember, he&#39;s a liar. Satan is a liar. And if we don&#39;t word our statements carefully, especially when we&#39;re touching on the issue of idol worship,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Satan capitalizes on our wrong utterances. Do not compromise with a &ldquo;little insurance&rdquo;. Follower talks of backache.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he will take that and will capitalize. If I say the slightest thing in defense, away from God. So, this is why I don&#39;t compromise when they ask me about</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">white lies and little insurance and things. I don&#39;t compromise because if I say anything</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that is a little, just slightly away from God&#39;s law, Satan will capitalize on it. And say &quot;see, he doesn&#39;t follow your law.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, I&#39;ll get smashed on the head. Because God invariably calls Satan&#39;s excuses.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And He says &quot;okay, go test him.&quot; Because God puts limits on him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When He sends him to test you, He puts limits on you. He says &quot;you can give her a cold and fever, but that&#39;s about it. You cannot give her a headache,&quot; for example.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We need to understand this mechanism. We believe in God. God told us &quot;there is Satan.&quot; And we need to understand what does Satan do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We read the other day, some of you were here, some were not, that Satan will come from your right, your left, from your right, right, left, front and back.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He will come to you from every direction. And he will exactly catch those sentences that may be misunderstood to mean that you&#39;re defending the idol worshippers or deviating from God&#39;s law.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he&#39;ll say &quot;this person... .&quot; He will lie.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But he will use your words. So, we don&#39;t wanna give him a chance to do that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Like Roxana said, she didn&#39;t mean to question God&#39;s wisdom. She was just discussing the thing intellectually.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it sounded like, if I didn&#39;t know her, I would think she was questioning God&#39;s wisdom. &quot;Why didn&#39;t God prohibit first cousins?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Why are the Christians wiser than God, for example, in prohibiting first cousins marriages?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Satan will do that. Satan will say &quot;Roxana means that You&#39;re not wise, as wise as the Christians.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Roxana: I think it takes a while before we realize that every letter of the Quran has to be followed, otherwise we makes mistakes. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Yes, exactly. It takes a while. It takes a while.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where is Martha? Martha.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No jumping, honey. Sit down. Sit down. Don&#39;t jump.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shut the door. Oh, are you there? Oh, you&#39;re praying?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay. I just wanna keep the kids under control, because they&#39;re jumping now. A woman: Nora, thank you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Mrs. Amir-Ali is not supposed to have a headache or cold or flu or anything like that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think also we have to realize the limitations of our bodies, I guess.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: No, I don&#39;t wanna compromise with that. A woman: No, no. Behrouz: Well, my problem is...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: I just remembered... Behrouz: My back problem is (unintelligible). I knew that I was not supposed to pick up anything. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Behrouz: But surprisingly, in four days, I didn&#39;t have any pain.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: It&#39;s just part of the test. You took Mehdi&#39;s... Behrouz: Yes. At this time... Dr. Khalifa: You love him so much that you said &quot;I&#39;m gonna take you backache. Behrouz: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Behrouz: I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s gonna love me this much. Dr. Khalifa: Because it&#39;s his anniversary.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God will love you and will remove it. God loves you and will remove it, IN SHAA ALLAH.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;If you give God the credit you can brag&rdquo; about God&rsquo;s blessings.

Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were fighting over one sheep. Well, actually, there&#39;s a great lesson here, but I wonder why did you take this out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Explanation of the story of David and 99 sheep. Be careful with our judgements.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: I did it before, actually. 24. Dr. Khalifa: You don&#39;t know what it is? A man: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: It&#39;s just two brothers, two brothers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One had 99 sheep and the other had one sheep. God wants to teach us a lesson about being very careful when you judge between the people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this... the fellows, they went to David to judge between them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fellow with the one sheep said &quot;I have one sheep and he has 99 sheep and he wants to take mine. And he insists on it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So obviously, the one with the 99 sheep... David said &quot;no, keep your sheep. Don&#39;t give it to the fellow. He has with 99 of them. You have only one.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So, if you give him your sheep, you&#39;ll have none and he will have 100. Keep yours.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, even though this judgment is very clearly fair, David still thought maybe he did the unjust</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">judgment and he repented and he was asking God for forgiveness and everything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can imagine how careful... This is what made David, David.

Then, David just said &quot;keep your one sheep and he keeps his 99.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They kill people, commit murder and they steal billions of dollars.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes.

Yeah, he waited, he, he, he waited and he studied and he did everything. And then he judged.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Emily got it. And that&#39;s it. He was afraid of... he was thinking of God. &quot;Did he do the right judgment?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course.

Dr. Khalifa: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Sometimes the jinn will be ahead of you. And the Quran, we were reading yesterday, or the day before yesterday, how God matches your companion,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">matches the companion, the jinn and the human companions are matched. So, if you&#39;re destined to believe, God matches a believing jinn with you, who is also destined to believe.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A person who&#39;s destined to disbelieve, God will match a disbelieving companion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Which makes sense. A man: Rashad, what about astrology?

They notice that the sun is in the zodiac and another zodiac this and that, so something happens on earth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It notices the people who are born under a certain sign, have certain characteristics. So, they made notes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they compile them and computerize them. Then, if you tell me that you&#39;re a Libra, I can tell you what your characteristics are.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;re more susceptible to colds and things like that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&#39;re just observations, Ok, a compilation, but it&#39;s very... it has a long way to go.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: No.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: See, we cannot see the jinns.

You can see here that the title of the Sura is the Winds.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we learn from the first few verses that the winds, their main job is to carry clouds</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and bring bounties. We need that water. So, in order to appreciate God and these simple words, just imagine yourself sending ten astronauts to space.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You, sending ten astronauts to space, and you tell them &quot;okay, you&#39;re gonna be out</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">there for three years, and when you need water, I made an invention in the spaceship,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">so there&#39;ll be these clouds on top of you, and they will give you water.&quot; You&#39;re sending them into space.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you devise that system that will give them water, clean water.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When they pollute the water they have on the spaceship, it&#39;s gonna, you know, one of...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">number one purification processes is distillation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, when they pollute, their own water is gonna evaporate, it&#39;s gonna be pure water, and come down again. So, you tell them that to assure them that they will have enough water supply for three years, or five years, ten years, or whatever.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You&#39;re sending them. Just imagine that. See, God sent this spaceship with five billion astronauts.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You and me, we are astronauts. That&#39;s right. And God gave us this system. God devised this system, where the water evaporates</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and then comes down by... the winds drive the clouds here. How far are we from the ocean?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We&#39;re far from the ocean. But these clouds came to us from the ocean, by the wind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s a traveling system. And it sends down pure water. You appreciate God if you think, if you imagine sending ten astronauts in space and you tell them</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m going to give you the exact percentage of oxygen for you to breathe.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now in 1967, we were technologically advanced people. 1967.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But we put three astronauts in a capsule in an atmosphere of 100% oxygen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pure oxygen, right? To breathe. And all it took was a spark.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the three astronauts were combusted. Ed White, Gus Grissom, and Roger Chaffee.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are not with us today because of that. We were really advanced in science.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But when you put anything in pure oxygen and light a match, everything would be combusted. Everything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everything organic, that is. In fact, this is for chemists.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If any chemist is here, this is the last thing you do to find out if there is, for example, radioactivity in the ashes of anything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You put it in a closed thing there. You fill it with 100% oxygen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you create a spark. And everything will be combusted into ashes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is what happened to the three astronauts. And this is why God didn&#39;t give us 100% oxygen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have 20% oxygen. The rest is nitrogen. And this is what they do now</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">when they send astronauts into space.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But they learned the hard way. So, despite our...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, we were sending people to the moon. And we couldn&#39;t give them the correct atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, these few verses here will make us appreciate God if we think of sending our own astronauts into space.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, you know how the oxygen is generated for us. We breathe it, and we get out carbon dioxide, which is not good for breathing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, God designed the trees, so they will take carbon dioxide and turn it into apples and give us the oxygen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They take the carbon and give us back the oxygen. How do you like that for a system?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Can you do that for your astronauts? You tell your 10 astronauts &quot;you&#39;re gonna be out there for 10 years, and you&#39;re gonna to breathe out carbon dioxide, so I&#39;m gonna give you</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a couple of... I invented these plants or something that will take your carbon dioxide, turn it into food for you, and you&#39;ll get the oxygen back.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Such is God&#39;s creation. And you think it&#39;s all evolution, right?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Are there any questions on these? The winds and the rains, bounties.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We&#39;re talking only about the 5 billion human beings.

Catherine: (unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Catherine: But there&#39;s a verse in the Quran where God talks about those (unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Catherine: Is that allegorical?

We could no longer stand the presence of God because we entertained doubt in His power.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And when we were brought into this world, our bodies were made visible to us. Now if we listen to what God is telling us, He&#39;s saying our bodies were made visible to us</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">when we came into this world. Well, that implies that our bodies and everything else that&#39;s visible to us in this world</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is not permanent or is not absolute because we came from somewhere else that made our bodies visible</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and made us see the things in front of our face. See?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, what happens? Satan deceives us and whispers to us and we begin to believe that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the only thing that&#39;s real is what is visible to us despite the proof.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, God in His mercy and His absoluteness revealed a miraculous code, revealed an irrefutable proof</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in the highest form of, you know, scientific language, mathematics, right in front of his face</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and he still denies it because he is supposed to deviate.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we see that as a result, the people, the falsifiers have to taste their retribution.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they will suffer in Hell because they defiantly challenged all of the signs of God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They defiantly challenged the revelation. They defied and opposed God&#39;s messenger and we know that the Muhammadans, the false Muslims,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">defiantly opposed the miracle of the Quran. And we know that they also defiantly opposed</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rashad as the Messenger of the Covenant.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In contrast to these people, the righteous will be rewarded and as we know the descriptions of</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Heaven and Hell in the Quran are allegorical. They are termed in ways that make us think of pleasure and contentment and happiness, life,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fruit, well-being, a garden with water and springs and flowers and food, but we know that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we cannot describe Heaven or Hell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What is the bargain? What is the bargain for those who are righteous, who heed the signs of God. They receive their Lord&#39;s blessings?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is obviously no greater bargain, but only a believer is guided to see that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Only a person who submits and desires to submit to God is guided to recognize that that is the greatest bargain,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that is the greatest promise possible in this world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it&#39;s not free. We&#39;re told in the Quran &quot;do not think that you are going to be allowed to say you believe without being tested.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We all have to go through tests in life, different circumstances, situations to increase that belief.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, IN SHAA ALLAH, hopefully until it approaches a point of certainty.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We don&#39;t question what Allah says in the Quran. We don&#39;t question His signs with certainty.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mahmoud and I were talking the other day and when you read about the descriptions of the, of Heaven</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for the believers, in light of the fact that we know that every letter of the Quran is divinely fixed and from Allah,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we know that every statement in the Quran is true. We are certain that every statement of the Quran is true.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we were kind of laughing the other day saying that it&#39;s a wonder that believers don&#39;t commit suicide</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to get to Heaven as fast as they can, you know, because we know that it&#39;s true.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No. What are some of the things that the righteous do in order to get this reward?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We&#39;re told that they don&#39;t, during the night or after sunset, they Pray.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They make their Evening Prayer, their Night Prayer. Or they spend their time reading the Quran or some form of worship, not the entire night,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">but they don&#39;t spend their night in idle play or things of no benefit to them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And at dawn, at Fajr, wake up and make the Fajr Salat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The righteous recite their Prayers five times a day because they know and they understand that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">making their Salat is contact with God. Douglas: It&#39;s contact and it&#39;s building up credits and their soul is growing so that their soul...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Sabahi: ...yeah a lot of... Douglas: Okay, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t really know the details of that. Dr. Sabahi: No, this is an example for the phenomenon that...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Douglas: I&#39;ll give you an example. Dr. Sabahi: ....but you don&#39;t see that. Douglas: I&#39;ll give you an example. None of us have ever seen an x-ray, but we know what happens if we get exposed to too many of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gamma rays. In other words, man is capable of learning that certain things exist</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that he cannot directly perceive because of the effect that it has on him. If he can rule out all of the possibilities of anything else in the environment,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he knows that there&#39;s something there that&#39;s causing this cancer or</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">causing this genetic mutation to take place. And he tries to learn and discover it. And if God wills, he learns that there is some</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">invisible energy, an x-ray or a gamma ray that passes through his body or something like that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He can&#39;t see it himself. Just like when a person goes to the doctor to get x-rays, when you see the picture, that&#39;s not the ray itself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">See? That&#39;s an after-image or a trace that is actually seen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the doctor or the nurse looks at the trace and knows that that was an x-ray or a particular type of ray that passes through the person.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, one of the ways we know that, well obviously this is a proof that all that exists isn&#39;t</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">limited obviously to what we directly perceive. Because so much around us affects us and influences and we cannot directly perceive.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Douglas: Does that, does that... Dr. Sabahi: Yeah, just, I think you quoted another verse that God is saying this and then you (unintelligible) by explaining...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Douglas: I was saying you what I would refer to as a fact that like if we look up in the ceiling and we see that light,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that&#39;s because of certain, right, stimuli. That&#39;s because of certain colors and</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">light waves that are hitting our eye, right? That has to do with the light waves and nervous</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">impulses and what have you that eventually lead to the sense that that is a light.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I see the light. Okay?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: But you don&#39;t see electricity. Douglas: Right, I don&#39;t see the electric. I can&#39;t see the actual light wave.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">See? So, in that sense what I was trying to say is that man really limits himself</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">when he says that he only wants to believe what he can see. Dr. Sabahi: But we know that a lot of people do that, especially these days to advance in science.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s what, that&#39;s what makes science advance. When people see things that physically you cannot see it, but if you use up your brain</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and brain power and imagination, you can see things that (unintelligible) But some people can do it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that&#39;s difference between (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: You&#39;re in trouble, Douglas. Martha&#39;s gonna ask you a question.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Martha: No, actually I (unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Martha: Actually, I (unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Martha: We know so much, not a lot of things but we have no idea what is the concept whereby we hear each other speak</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and somehow understand what that person is saying, just zero, absolutely nothing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We know that it happens, but we don&#39;t know, we don&#39;t understand part of what mechanism the ear receives these waves and then somehow takes these waves and translates them into</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">something that then goes into our brain. I mean, we just don&#39;t know. We have no idea how these things happen. And we do it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Four-year-old children do it and two-year-old children do it.

Douglas: The first major sense that we developed in the womb was hearing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hearing is almost fully developed in the womb before birth, before birth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: It&#39;s amazing you remember that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay, verse 24. Douglas: Lessons from the past: Abraham.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Have you narrated... Excuse me. [51:24] Have you noted the narration about Abraham&#39;s honorable guests?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[51:25] When they entered, they said &quot;Peace.&quot; And he said, &quot;Peace to you, strangers!&quot; [51:26] He then asked his family to prepare a fattened calf.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[51:27] He offered it to them, but they did not eat. [51:28] He became wary of them. They said, &quot;Do not be afraid,&quot; and they gave him good news of a knowledgeable son.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[51:29] His wife came in astonishment, pointing at her face and saying: &quot;I am a sterile old woman.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[51:30] They said, &quot;Your Lord said thus. He is the Most Wise, the Omniscient.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These honorable guests that came to see Abraham were angels. They were actually on their way to Gomorrah, Sodom and Gomorrah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were commissioned to go and destroy Sodom and Gomorrah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because the people of Lot had reached the point of no return, in terms of their opposition against God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The practice of homosexuality and other kinds of wickedness. And so, their destruction was already written.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was already predetermined. And when they went to Abraham&#39;s house, he gave them the greeting and welcome as a believer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we know, God commands us in the Quran to greet the people with a hearty greeting, with a,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to give people a sense of welcome. And they returned it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But when he offered them the food, they didn&#39;t eat it. And at this particular time, in Abraham&#39;s culture, whenever you went to someone&#39;s house and</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they offered you of their table and you did not eat it, this would arouse suspicion and sometimes fear.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because a guest should return, a guest should, you know, eat of the offering that the host meant.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he became somewhat worried as to who they were and what they wanted.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And as we see here, they told him not to be afraid. And they told him that he would have a son by his wife, Sarah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And she could not believe it, obviously, because of her age. And she asked in a different way the same question that Mary asked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When the angel went to her and told her that she was gonna have a son. And we know in Sura 4, she said &quot;How can I have a son when no man has touched me?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the angel let her know that Allah could cause life and create the birth of a child</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">38:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">or the conception of a child in the womb of a woman anytime He wills. He created Adam and Eve out of nothing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I think this was Isaac. Dr. Khalifa: Right. Douglas: This was the birth of Isaac. Douglas: And this was a miracle as well.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The birth of Isaac was a miracle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, we see that Abraham... God blessed Abraham with many, many sons.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We knew... We know that in the Quran, God told him to place four pieces of a bird on different hills.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Four birds. Douglas: four birds on different hills and called them together and they would come.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Many pieces of four birds. Douglas: Here we have his wife having a child well beyond the age which is normally possible for a woman to bear a child.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have the influence of Satan in the dream where he thought he was told to sacrifice Ismail.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We also have the miracle when Abraham&#39;s father was such a wicked, he was so so defiant, so arrogant and so wicked</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">when Abraham confronted him that he actually built a fire to cremate him, to cremate his own son.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we know in the Quran that Abraham sat in the fire until the flames died down and he walked out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The power of God, the power of Allah. Douglas: Blessed with many miracles, many signs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: No, Ismail.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Douglas: Any questions or comments?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: There you said it, his only son. Isaac was never the only son.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You said the truth right there. A woman: But isn&#39;t that the reason they say it is because Isaac was his only legitimate son, but we know why.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: This is how they justify it. A woman: But it still... Dr. Khalifa: It didn&#39;t say &quot;take your only legitimate son.&quot; It said &quot;take your only son,&quot; even if he&#39;s illegitimate.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But he was not illegitimate. Did you say &quot;you take your only son&quot; or &quot;your only legitimate son?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: According to the Bible, (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: No.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Somebody, of course, the Jews and the Christians believe it was Isaac. But that&#39;s a racial, that&#39;s a racial distortion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They said &quot;take your only son, Isaac,&quot; So, they made a boo-boo there, because Isaac was never the only son.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, when you tell them, when you confront them with that only son business, because Ishmael was 14 years older than Isaac.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They tell you &quot;oh, it&#39;s because Isaac was the only legitimate son.&quot; I said &quot;OK, let&#39;s look at the Bible.&quot; And the Bible consistently calls Ishmael Abraham&#39;s son until Abraham dies. And then they say</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;when Abraham died, his two sons, Ishmael and Isaac, buried him.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, there&#39;s no way out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No. No, he didn&#39;t. No, you read it in some novel.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From who? A woman: It&#39;s in the first book of the Bible. I don&#39;t know. Dr. Khalifa: No, no, it&#39;s not, it&#39;s not in Genesis.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">OK, Abraham had... I mean, Sarah was sterile. She didn&#39;t have anything but Isaac.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah, there were lots of novels that he said he married this and that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">OK. If he had any other children, they&#39;re irrelevant, because the Quran and the Bible mention only Ishmael and Isaac.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Nobody else. A woman: Right, because then the Bible says when Abraham died... Dr. Khalifa: His two sons...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: And that would be an internal contradiction, because there is another mention of other sons in that, right in the Bible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: I don&#39;t think so. I don&#39;t remember. But anyway, this is the verse in Genesis 22,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: I&#39;m saying that... Dr. Khalifa: In Genesis 22, around 25, it says &quot;when Abraham died, his two sons, Ishmael and Isaac, buried him.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">43:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, Ishmael was Abraham&#39;s son. He was the only son of Abraham for 14 years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isaac was never the only son. A woman: Ok. What would be an (unintelligible) Isaac?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Isaac is the father of the Jews. Ishmael is the father of the Arabs. The Jews wrote the... I mean, played around with the Genesis, the Torah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: So, the idea is that they just wanted the miracle to be a miracle with Isaac?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Right. They didn&#39;t want anything to Ishmael to have anything to to do with anything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, they made a big mistake, just like the two verses in the Quran. Exactly. They made a glaring error.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they tried to correct it in the newer editions of the Bible. They say &quot;take your only one.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">44:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Trying very hard, but they make it worse. Your only one what? Donkey? Or...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: Ishamael will... How could I... Ishmael lived... God commanded Abraham to send them away.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: It was just another town. Dr. Khalifa: It was just another town.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: Because I was wondering a period of (unintelligible) Ishameal (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: About three or four weeks. Three or four weeks at a time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ok. Back to Douglas. And 31.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Douglas: Sodom and Gomorrah. [51:31] Abraham said, &quot;Where are you going, O messengers?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[51:32] They said, &quot;We have been dispatched to guilty people. [51:33] &quot;We are to shower them with stones of clay.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">45:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[51:34] &quot;Marked at your Lord for the transgressors.&quot; [51:35] We then delivered all the believers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[51:36] We found only one house of Muslim submitters therein. [51:37] We set it up as a lesson for anyone who fears the painful retribution.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Abraham knew that they were messengers of God. That in this context, angels are messengers of God. They carry warning.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They carry the revelations, the knowledge, and they also carry out commands from God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s interesting in terms of the Armenia, the earthquake in Armenia. After the devastating earthquake, they had a lot of people on the news conjecturing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And one of the major conjectures they came up with was that Armenia is an earthquake fault. It&#39;s a fault area.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They begin to conjecture. I mean, there&#39;s nothing wrong with theorizing, but what we find is that when these disasters take place,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">most people don&#39;t, well, at least the people who are allegedly the ones who are so called experts or the people who are paid to give their opinion, they make no mention of God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That doesn&#39;t mean that some of the people don&#39;t, but they seem to be locked up or blocked out</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">at any suggestion that there is a greater power at work that causes these devastations,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">let alone produces the bounty and benefit. They refuse to believe that there is a God, an intelligence, that this is by design,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that there are laws and rules. They wanna believe that it&#39;s either by haphazard, you see, or</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">simply due to some malfunction or something off in the earth&#39;s structure, just as an example.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the messenger angels were dispatched to the people of Sodom and Gomorrah. And we know that they were showered with volcanoes, tremendous earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it completely destroyed that area of land, totally. It was so much devastation, fire, and heat that we know that the salt plains,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it created miles of salt plains where there has been tremendous heat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it&#39;s proof in verse 34 that these types of disasters are commanded by Allah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the people who die in these disasters are already determined. They&#39;re already identified.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, only God controls the time of death, and also people who are disbelievers</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">are identified by God, and this is one of the things we see in verse 34, [51:34] &quot;Marked at your Lord for the transgressors.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">48:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That these stones, volcanic ash, this heat, this lava, all of this was marked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No transgressor, not a single transgressor could leave Sodom and Gomorrah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just a small family of believers who were with Lot were saved.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it doesn&#39;t make any difference if you&#39;ve got seismograph in your front, in your living room</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to tell you that there are tremors in the earth. I mean, I&#39;m saying it doesn&#39;t make any difference what kind of alarm system you&#39;ve got.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Your best alarm system, and I&#39;m not dismissing that, I&#39;m saying the best alarm system is</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">submitting to God alone in this life, period. Because we know that God is the One that controls all things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God controls, you know, circumstances. A human being is supposed to take precautions, use his or her intelligence,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">but to also understand that God controls all things.

Because those soft plains are still there for anyone to see and to reflect on the magnitude of that disaster.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if someone says &quot;well, what brought this about or what caused it?&quot; Well, again, we know. We know that the code has confirmed that every word and sentence in the Quran is true.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s fact. And when a person is given the opportunity to be exposed to the code, to all of the information,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and they sincerely want to believe, they know that the Quran is from God. And if God...God tells us what was behind the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Are there any questions or comments? A woman: I&#39;m just listening to the news of Armenia</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m hearing that in Armenia, now they&#39;re celebrating Christmas (unintelligible) service.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And during the service, they were saying, they&#39;re preparing it for Jonah&#39;s (unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They believe (unintelligible) was saved. And nothing in the earth is permanent.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, it&#39;s interesting. They&#39;re talking about how Jesus found us (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Sodom and Gomorrah, we bring destruction upon ourselves, Parents take their children out of God&rsquo;s protection. God assigns Souls to certain environments. Discussions on AIDS.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: They don&#39;t learn, do they? A woman: No. Dr. Khalifa: Haven&#39;t learned a thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">People bring their destruction on themselves. We know that Sodom and Gomorrah, they were all corrupted beyond reform.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is the one thing that... I mean, they brought it on themselves. So, it is God&#39;s law that when they do this, they are destroyed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nowadays, where homosexuals are spread in the society, you cannot just destroy the city of Tucson because there are a thousand homosexuals in it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But you can send a virus to pick them out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is what&#39;s happening now. A man: What happens to the children who are (unintelligible)?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Their parents brought it on them. A man: What if you got it from blood transfusion?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Right. They brought it on themselves. Their family, Their family take the children out of God&#39;s protection.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is what happens. It&#39;s actually a blessing for the children, after all. But if you... whatever disaster happens, it&#39;s because the parents removed their children out of God&#39;s protection.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: How could it be that the parents actually develop the fate of the child?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Ok. We discussed this before. And we said when... When the parents do not follow the commandments, God assigns to their homes, souls that deserve whatever is gonna happen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The children are not so innocent as we think. Remember Adolf Hitler was a cute child.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: Who? Dr. Khalifa: Hitler. He was a cute, innocent child.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But God knew in advance that he&#39;s gonna be a tyrant.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So was Gaddafi.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Do you understand, Babak? Do you understand the point?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Babak: I have a hard time understanding it. Dr. Khalifa: Okay, the babies who will be born next year, where are they now?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Remember, we existed before the earth came into creation. Okay, the children who will be born next year, where are they now?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Babak: Not here. Dr. Khalifa: Right. They&#39;re in some depository, waiting their turn to come into this world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now you agree that God knows which ones are good and which ones are bad, right? Okay, God told the people in the Bible that if you don&#39;t keep the commandments,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you will incur, you will remove yourselves from God&#39;s protection for four generations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, what is the mechanism? What is the mechanism here? It&#39;s that when a baby is born in a certain home next year, God will assign a certain soul to that home, right?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But God does that. He assigns the souls to the homes and the environments where they grow in.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, God can pick out a good soul or a bad soul, depending on what the situation is.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">We are in an Era of belief, Believers protected from accidents and Diseases. Doubter debates.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the people who pass AIDS onto their babies, they brought it on themselves because they use drugs or...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: But AIDS is mainly a homosexual disease. There&#39;s no question about it. Babak: Rashad, I was talking about Babak: children who are, for some reason or another, need blood transfusions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Right. Babak: And they get blood transfusions, not from their parents, Babak: not that their parents have AIDS or drugs or whatever. Dr. Khalifa: From the blood, yes. Even those.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Babak: But they get AIDS because of some other jerk, who had AIDS or whatever. Dr. Khalifa: Right. Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Babak: And I just think of... Dr. Khalifa: Okay, we are, we are in an era now where believing house will not need a blood transfusion, to start with.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Babak: We don&#39;t (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: We are in an era where when you believe in God and follow His commandments,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you will not need a blood transfusion to start with, neither you, nor your family.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Maybe difficult to fathom, but this is God&#39;s promise throughout the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Babak: I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t mean (unintelligible). But if you go outside in the street and there&#39;s an accident, you lose some blood and...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Well, that, I&#39;m saying this will not happen, to start with.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God says He&#39;ll protect you from anything like that. If it has to happen, God will protect you, will give you clean blood.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I&#39;m saying that it will not happen, to start with.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay, let me... Because this is difficult to understand, and I&#39;m not bragging or anything, but I thank God first. I wanna tell you,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m speaking from experience. And I mention this. It&#39;ll be boring to a lot of these people here, because they heard it before.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But when I was a child, I used to go swim in the canals in the countryside, the village.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there&#39;s a disease in Egypt that if you swim in the canal, you have to catch that disease called Bilharzia. It&#39;s still epidemic in Egypt.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: And every year, they&#39;ll take the children and check them for Bilharzia, through a urine sample. A woman: They don&#39;t even check them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: Then I used to watch it for so many years, people who lived in the countryside where they would go swimming They&#39;d never even check (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: At the end of the summer, they lined them up, did a check against (unintelligible). They do Dr. Khalifa: Right. A woman: the same with Bilharzia. They never even bothered checking. Dr. Khalifa: Well, they asked them. Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa Right. A woman: They just did it. They lined them all up and gave them a shot. Dr. Khalifa: These are the ones they knew they swam in the canal, right?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, I was living in a city. So, they checked all the children, at least in my time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They took a urine sample and check them for Bilharzia. And every time, I come out negative.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they&#39;ll ask me &quot;did you go to the village this summer?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Did you swim in the canal?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; Okay, now they sent a nurse with me, to make sure that I&#39;m giving them a urine sample, not a faucet,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">not a sample from the faucet. They&#39;ll go with me, and they will take the sample, and it&#39;ll be negative. And I&#39;ll go home, and my father would ask me &quot;did they check you for Bilharzia?&quot; I say &quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He said &quot;what did they find?&quot; I said &quot;nothing.&quot; And my father shake his head. It&#39;s God&#39;s protection. So, I learned that from an early stage.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, you can live in the virus, live in the germs, and God will protect you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I guess God knew that I&#39;d be passing this information on to you. And before I do anything, I thank God for His protection. Then, I&#39;m talking to you from experience.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It will not happen. When you&#39;re a believer, it will not happen. You will not catch AIDS. You will not need transfusion. You will not have an accident.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You don&#39;t even get traffic tickets, depending how good you are. You will get these as pinches whenever you do something wrong.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But for as long as you&#39;re sincerely searching for God, God will give you time, will protect you, until you make a decision.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Your decision would be to remain in God&#39;s protection, or step out of God&#39;s protection.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it&#39;s your decision. God left it in our hands. Babak: What I&#39;m saying is that everybody dies at some time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: That&#39;s right. Babak: Every one of us is gonna die Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Babak: for one reason or another, accident, (unintelligible), whatever. Dr. Khalifa: That&#39;s right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Yeah, but... Babak: And it&#39;s gonna happen. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Dr. Khalifa: Well, death is not a disaster. Babak: ...disease that was an easier...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: No, Death is a fact of life for each one of us. Babak: The impression that I&#39;m getting is that staying with God is gonna protect us from all evil and all harm. Dr. Khalifa: That&#39;s right. That&#39;s right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Babak: And as long as you believe that harmful is gonna come to us... Babak: But at the end, maybe at the age of 90, or 500, or whatever, we&#39;re gonna die. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Babak: And we&#39;re gonna die of something. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. That&#39;s right.

And it always caused me trouble in school, because if I didn&#39;t understand it, I couldn&#39;t do anything about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I became Muslim, and I read the Quran, and I found out that I had to submit, even though I didn&#39;t understand something.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was really a test for me, because I just wanted to know. And I never understood the jinns. I wish like... And I read it and I knew that they...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thank you. And I knew because it was in the Quran. I had to believe it, but I didn&#39;t know what they were, and nobody could explain it to me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, and I got really wild explanations of what the jinns were.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it always troubled me, but I just forced myself to submit.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And in the second chapter of the Quran, where it says that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;the believers are those who believe in the unseen.&quot; And this was part of the unseen. And I knew that, IN SHAA ALLAH, over time, that God would explain it to me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And one of the blessings of being in this mosque is having things explained to us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">5:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And as Rashad said in the Khutba today, it&#39;s a mercy from God that He sends a messenger from among us to explain to us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The knowledge is here in the Quran, and all of us have read the Quran. You know, I read it once a month, from front to back.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And every time there&#39;s something new. And we get what we need at the time we need it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we in this mosque are just developing so far. It&#39;s just amazing. You know, Rashad and Lisa and Hasan went to Canada, and there were the people believed they way we do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&#39;re still way behind us in the knowledge, because we&#39;re here every Friday night, learning and studying.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have the input of all these believers here. And we have a messenger that is given the knowledge that is passed on to us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we&#39;re responsible for the information in the Quran. And, you know, the verse in the Quran that was admonishing the (unintelligible), saying that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">6:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they were believers when they weren&#39;t really. They were just submitters, and that&#39;s the first step. But only the believers can attain Paradise.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, if we don&#39;t have absolute certainty, we can&#39;t ever grow and develop to our fullest extent.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that&#39;s where the increased knowledge is that should bless me. And I read, you know, I&#39;ve read this verse so many times, and the first time I read it,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you too, the humans and the jinns, you know, I just didn&#39;t understand what it meant. I didn&#39;t understand what the jinns were, what their role was, what they had to do with me or with us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was just a mystery. And I just, you know, like I said, I had to force myself not to question it, not to be hung up about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we had that discussion about jinns in the Quranic studies, I just kept my mouth shut, you know, very different things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But now, just in this last year, we found out what this is, and so this chapter has a totally different meaning.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">7:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And for the first time, I understand what it means. And we know now that the jinns are, you know, they have the same requirements.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&#39;s other verses in the Quran that they have the same requirements that we do. Some of them believed in Jesus, and they believed in other things, and then they heard the Quran,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and they believed, and, you know, they have the same requirements that we do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they also have the same rewards that we do. You know, there are entities that we can&#39;t see. You know, we don&#39;t know. They can see us, but we can&#39;t see them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And yet, the Heaven that&#39;s described here in later verses is for them, too. They have their own, but it&#39;s the same set-up as ours. It&#39;s exactly the same for them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Like, you know, these creatures that are so important in this scripture that we don&#39;t know anything about.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And now we know that the jinns were those that, before creation, sided with Satan and</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">took a stand against God and believed that Satan could be a god besides God, that God could have partners, which is the ultimate blasphemy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they were banished, and they have a chance to redeem themselves as well.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And our job is to, you know, and I used to read about Satan and his troops</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and generations of jinns and humans, that I didn&#39;t know, how do they, how do they come to be generations?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How do they multiply? How do they, you know, what do they do to reproduce themselves?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now we know that a jinn is assigned to each one of us, and so their reproduction is,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it coincides with our reproduction, that each one of us is given a companion at</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the time of our entry into this world, and we&#39;re in the same boat. We both sinned.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We both came to this earth with original sin. We both took a stand against God, the jinns more forcefully than we did, but we took the same stand</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">as not being for God, because there&#39;s only two ways. Either you&#39;re for or you&#39;re against, and we were wishy-washy, but basically we were against God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">9:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We&#39;ve both been given the chance to redeem ourselves. Thing is, the jinns took the definite stand. So, they&#39;re going to try to convert us to Satan&#39;s way of thinking and to the original sin that we committed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, we have to convert them. So from the time of birth, we&#39;re in this constant struggle with our jinn companion to convert them to righteousness</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and to protect ourselves from falling into the path of the jinn. And It&#39;s a struggle. It&#39;s a struggle every day of our lives, and it just goes on and on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the blessing about knowing who your enemy is, is knowing what they are, what their goal is,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">what their tactics are, so you can learn how to defend yourself. And that&#39;s what the Quran is, and that&#39;s where these blessings come from.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, we know that. And to me, the greatest blessing of all is knowing that we do have original sin and we&#39;re bad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, we were born bad, because we took the stand against God. So now that we know that, we know what we have to do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">10:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have to, just every day of our lives, try to redeem ourselves from that sin.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the Quran is very specific about giving us the way to do it, and we know now,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we&#39;ve heard it several times in Khutbas, that we have to ask ourselves every day &quot;who is my god this week?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ok. Because that&#39;s our only goal in life, is to redeem ourselves. Nothing else has any importance whatsoever.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we have to do certain things. We have to support ourselves. We have to take care of ourselves. But</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with the goal in mind that this is to do righteousness, you know, we can&#39;t be a burden to society, we can&#39;t steal, so we have to work and support ourselves.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it&#39;s all in tune with the same thing, which is purifying ourselves, and growing and developing our souls.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So as soon as you take that stand, then the jinns are going to try to,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">11:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">your companion and others are going to try and make you stray away from that path. And the greater the stand you take, the greater the enticements are going to be, and you just have to be prepared.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I&#39;ve talked to several people who&#39;ve said that they&#39;ve encountered the same thing I did when I made the stand, that I was going to really try and devote more of my thoughts</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to God because I wasn&#39;t doing enough, and I knew it, that they just took over, and they didn&#39;t want me to, even the little that I was doing was in danger of not being done at all.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s just a constant struggle. And so I know this now, and I know that I have to just be on the alert at all times for, for this. And we know that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">most of it is sneaky whispering. And there&#39;s even a Sura where, you know, this is</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">devoted to this, that Satan whispers to us, I mean, little things that don&#39;t seem so bad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, we&#39;ve talked about this before. &quot;Oh, you can wait until the game is over before you pray&quot; or you know &quot;I&#39;ll pray later,&quot; and then something happens and you don&#39;t pray.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that time can never be regained. Once you miss the Prayer, you can&#39;t make it up. That time is...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The inhabitants of Hell are the farthest from God on the Day of Judgment. Knowing that Heaven is close to God, they will leave Hell and sneak into the area closer to God,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">but because they are not sufficiently prepared to come close to God, they will suffer terribly in the presence of God and will flee back to Hell and so on forever.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Here&#39;s this vicious circle that they&#39;re in. A man: It&#39;s just like the Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They don&#39;t believe in Hell, but they believe 144,000 go to Heaven and the remainder</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of their chosen people or whatever go to Paradise. But they still deny Hell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They say &quot;there&#39;s no burning Hell. There&#39;s no none of this. You just no longer exist,&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">which is a lie of... outright lying itself, because nothing that exists can be destroyed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, like matter can&#39;t be created or destroyed, ever destroyed. It just recycles.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the real world that we&#39;re in. No, in the other world, this is not the real world, but in the world we&#39;re in now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, they don&#39;t believe in Hell, because if you tell them anything contrary to anything pleasant after death,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they say &quot;well, we just don&#39;t exist anymore.&quot; &quot;Well, we never get punished for what we do wrong.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;And that&#39;s our punishment, not existing.&quot; &quot;Well, we can get a reward. If we&#39;re real good, we get this reward.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;But if we&#39;re real bad, we just don&#39;t exist anymore.&quot; &quot;Just have a reward and no punishment.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: They wish, they wish this. A man: That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. This, this is... A woman: Thank you. Dr. Khalifa: Quran... A man: This is what I thought about it. Dr. Khalifa: The Quran says &#39;they will wish that they...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Yeah. &quot;This is the Hell they used to deny.&quot; Dr. Khalifa: Yes. A man: They deny Hell. Dr. Khalifa: Exactly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: I just wanna add here something that we should all know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I know Laurie knows that but she just didn&#39;t mention it yet. It has to do with the looks.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">14:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">See, verse 40 says, (unintelligible), number 39.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where&#39;s the... Well, not they ask...Oh, 39, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;The humans and the jinn will not be asked about their sins.&quot; Nobody will need to ask anybody about anything, because the believers develop their souls,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and the disbelievers fail to develop their souls. And in Sura 17, we&#39;re told that the differences in the Hereafter are...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this room, the differences in our sizes are within a few inches. But in the Hereafter, the difference will be like the difference between a mouse and the city of New York, city of Tucson, let&#39;s say.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, when you see somebody the size of the city of Tucson, he or she has developed the soul sufficiently.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is why they will be able to come closer to God. When you see somebody&#39;s the size of a mouse, you don&#39;t need to ask, you know &quot;what did you do wrong?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, that is, this is why nobody will need to ask anybody about their sins.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is so obvious. There&#39;ll be no question. Also, in Sura 17, we&#39;re told that everybody will be the judge for him or herself, to herself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because in that dimension, we will see what we really look like, how much we really developed or how much we lacked development.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, boy, when they get you, they&#39;ll be recognized by their looks. They&#39;ll be undeveloped. They&#39;ll be shrunken, like being born without arms and legs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Deformed. They will be born into the Hereafter, deformed, undeveloped, aborted.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But they&#39;ll be alive, very well, I mean, well, very alive, not well.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Also, God lets us understand, as Lori explained in verse 44, how they will try to sneak into Heaven, and they&#39;ll find it worse than Hell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They will sneak into the Lower Heaven, and they will find it worse than Hell, because they cannot stand, come any closer to God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">See, God left it completely up to us, completely. This is why God does not inflict an atom&#39;s weight of injustice.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s absolutely up to you. You can be as close to God as you want, in the High Heaven, or you can be as far from God as you want.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s completely up to us. So, the conclusion is that God does not put a single person in Hell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is the people who insist or choose, and they insist on going to Hell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This, the whole thing will be automatic in the Hereafter. This is why it is important to do, for example, the five Prayers a day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You don&#39;t do the five Prayers every day, you won&#39;t talk. That&#39;s the minimum that you can do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because those are the meals for the real person.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Imagine if you don&#39;t feel... your body does not dry, and you don&#39;t feed your body for two months.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What will your body look like? There&#39;s no death in the Hereafter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just imagine not eating for two months.

Can you imagine what they look like? Just look into our dimension here and think of bodies that didn&#39;t eat for years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You see those skeletal pictures of the starving people in Central Africa, Ethiopia, Sudan.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What they look like, you can see their ribs. The shrunk skin and bones.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this happens to the soul if the soul is not fed the five meals every day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[55:41] The guilty will be recognized by their looks;...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can tell who is starving in Africa and who is not. By looking at them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And in the Hereafter, you will be able to know who is starving and who is not.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Except it will be by choice.

How could anything like that exist? But this is even greater.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All we had to do was say our five Prayers every day, not to have any other gods besides God, but just for our own benefit anyway.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God doesn&#39;t need us.

What God has in store for us is so much greater.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In fact, we&#39;re told in the Quran that we can&#39;t even imagine what is in store for us as a reward for doing what we&#39;re supposed to do in the first place.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s just incredible mercy.

Naghmeh: Oh, Okay.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay, God says &quot;and those who are far ahead will be far ahead.&quot; And they will be closest to God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And far ahead is, of course, the Highest Heaven. Then, and we know that far ahead doesn&#39;t mean how much money you have or what looks you have</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">or how much education you&#39;ve got. But it means, what, the kind of intelligence that you have within where you see God and the truth and righteousness.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, and we know that that&#39;s what puts us far ahead.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not because, like I was saying earlier, that there are a lot of people who have all those things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they feel like they have a lot of power and they&#39;re in control. But they are very miserable. And they go through drugs and alcohol.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Most of the people who are out there that are into drugs and alcohol are doctors, people that we go to help us,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">people who make all that money and who are in the high parts of society.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And people who think they are in control. Not that every doctor is bad or anything like that. But the power has a lot of times led to trouble.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because people are not righteous enough. And they don&#39;t see. And they don&#39;t open their hearts. And they don&#39;t let go of that ego enough to understand that if you use your power with God&#39;s will,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">then maybe you&#39;ll get somewhere. But other than that, you don&#39;t get anywhere.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Maybe here for a while. Like God says &quot;I&#39;ll let them enjoy this life for a while.&quot; But just for a while.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, then we know that there are people who don&#39;t have those things. Yet their lives are very calm and very fulfilled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And also, as I was saying earlier, is that the Quran has taught us that God is in full control of our money, of what we look like,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of what we, of how our lives are the thread that we walk into our lives.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, then it seems pretty unfair that God would choose some people to have money and looks and put them in Heaven because of that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But what makes more sense is that God has given every one of us, no matter what standards we have,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He has given us that freedom of choice, which makes us equal. And makes us the wise ones if we seek to choose the right path.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, and that&#39;s where we&#39;ll be if we do the commandments in the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the people of Jesus or Moses&#39; time did everything that they brought down through the Bible or the Torah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, and if they did those things, then they will be in the Far Heaven.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And of course we know that this is the most complete. The prayers and the fasting and the charity, and belief in God alone and the Hereafter, and working righteousness.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, and God willing, that will put us far ahead and make us sovereigns on earth,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">no matter how much money or anything we have. And a lot of times I think that&#39;s really hard to understand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And a lot of times we get bogged down. I know I do. Like when I see someone, you know, who has cute clothes on her, that&#39;s really pretty or something like that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, and you just have to step back and think and say &quot;that&#39;s not important. You have what God thought was good for you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God says that you&#39;ll be [56:12] In the gardens of bliss.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[56:13] Multitudes from the early generations. Gardens of bliss is of course Heaven.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[56:13] Multitudes from the early generations. We have a footnote that says &quot;the early generations of Muslims were characterized by following the Quran, the whole Quran, and nothing but the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">250 years after the Prophet, Hadith and Sunnah appeared, followed by the various schools of jurisprudence.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This marked the progressive deterioration of the Muslim nation.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ok. This tells us &quot;the early generations,&quot; those are the people that had the big prophets. Those are the ones who had the messengers</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that... well, we have messengers, too, but it just seems like there then it seemed like it was more in people&#39;s lives.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, it seems like technology has taken our lives so much that people don&#39;t think about God actually sending angels down or messengers down or miracles down.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But... So, those people who did follow the exact correct way were in the early generations and there are some people now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But right now it seems like we just need more and more and more proof to make us be disciplined enough to understand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, and it seems like as time has gone by, people just want to interpret the way they think.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They don&#39;t like something the way it sounds. They have to change it to the way they want it. And that just makes a lot of conflict. And thank God that&#39;s why we have the Quran, which is so easy to understand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">31:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And God says it&#39;s easy to memorize and understand. And, and it says in the footnote that &quot;250 years after the Prophet, these two books appeared.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we know that these two books are the books that have all the traditions, the things that are totally contradictory to the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And these people are so blind that they don&#39;t even sit down to compare, to understand and see</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that it is contradictory to what their Prophet that they idolize brought down.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Number 14.

And, and so it seems like it is harder.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">32:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I guess now we have all the Prayer and we have all the five commandments.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it is. It&#39;s more, I don&#39;t know what you wanna call it, technical or something to get.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">33:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&#39;s more work maybe to get to the Highest Heaven.

You&#39;ve got to go to the Highest, Highest, Highest Heaven. I&#39;m gonna explain to you why.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">39:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Abraham started the religion of Islam, according to God&#39;s instructions, he and the people around him were worshipping God alone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And as time went by, Satan sneakily and gradually added idol worship until the time of Muhammad came, some centuries later.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the time Muhammad came, they were worshipping lots of idols,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Allaat, Manaat, Al-&lsquo;Uzzah, and all that. They were in the Kaaba that Abraham built.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you&#39;ve read how many verses in Quran that say &quot;Abraham was never an idol worshipper.&quot; Yet, there is the Kaaba that he built that was full of idols.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then God renewed the message, sent the Quran to Muhammad. And sent Muhammad to tell the people &quot;the idols are bad. Worship God alone. Worship God alone.&quot; So, what happened?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Muhammad and his company were persecuted severely. They threw on them all kinds of dirt and thorns.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">40:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, they banished them when they grew. There were about 10 or 15 people for about 3 years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, they grew to about maybe 25 or 30 people. Then, they thought they were getting too strong, so they banished them out of Mecca, boycotted them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, and those people were abused. So, those have to have a special place in Heaven.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They went against the current. They were worshipping God alone in an ocean of idolatry.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can easily see that they were very special people. They will be in the highest place in the High Heaven.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because even within the High Heaven and the Low Heaven will be ranks.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay, now, 20 years ago, you see how it says here,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[56:14] Few from the later generations. Now, these are later generations after Muhammad. 1400 years after Muhammad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">41:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is not a single mosque in the Muslim world that was worshipping God alone, that was, that is upholding the commandment &quot;the mosque belongs to God, you should not mention other names with God.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then God renewed the message right now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the message went loud and clear, ringing throughout the whole world. &quot;Worship God alone.&quot; Say &quot;La Elaha Ella Allah.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">42:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">NOT &quot;La Elaha Ella Allah, Muhammad Rasulallah.&quot; And &quot;devote yourselves to God alone.

They threw him in the fire. So, what did God do?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He turned the fire into a cool and safe place. Because God, God says &quot;do not think that I will abandon my messengers.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God creates exits for them. So, the exit for Abraham was a cool and safe fire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">46:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the people who were with him, they were persecuted. They have to be special people.

Not one hair.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is why he&#39;s very special. I&#39;m just using Mahmoud as an example. Muhtesem went to a grocery store to buy some Middle Eastern stuff.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he met some Arabs there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&#39;re just totally ignorant. They know nothing. But he says &quot;yes, we go to Masjid Tucson. We worship God alone.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they almost beat him up. If he wasn&#39;t big enough and strong enough, and a Turk, they would have beaten him up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, why do you have to take all this abuse and all this ridicule? Do you think it shook him up?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Did it affect his faith? If anything, it strengthened his faith.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because he knows that those people are wrong. He knows they&#39;re ignorant. He knows they&#39;re not worshipping God alone. He knows they lost their Prayer. Probably, never Pray.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">47:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those people, do you think they Pray?

Because of this, God reserves a special place for them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God is reserving a special place for us. I&#39;m saying it by God&#39;s grace.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I have this very good news for you.

Millions. In just 50 years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But they will be following the crowd. They cannot be like you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They will be protected by their numbers. Right at this location, right here, there&#39;ll be thousands, on this block, in this mosque.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there&#39;ll be powerful... the people jumping on the wagons. But they don&#39;t deserve the same position, or the same credit as you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is, this is what it means.

You are very special people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You deserve a lot of congratulations. God says in Sura 35 that the angels have wings, 2, 3, and 4.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">2, 3, and 4, because the angels closest to God will be the most powerful, the highest in rank.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They have more wings. This is figuratively speaking.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And these (56:10) &#1649;&#1604;&#1587;&#1614;&#1617;&#1600;&#1648;&#1576;&#1616;&#1602;&#1615;&#1608;&#1606;&#1614; &#1649;&#1604;&#1587;&#1614;&#1617;&#1600;&#1648;&#1576;&#1616;&#1602;&#1615;&#1608;&#1606;&#1614; these far ahead people, like yourselves, will be there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, all those are angels, but still, they have ranks.

And they&#39;ll go to the High Heaven, but they cannot attain your rank.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because you&#39;re the ones who are taking the abuse.

Tell him &quot;I believe God.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I believe that I am in this group. [56:13] Multitudes from the early generations.* Because this is the first generation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, I couldn&#39;t believe it myself. For a long time, I said &quot;it couldn&#39;t be just us here worshipping God alone. There must be millions in the world.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I discovered that I&#39;m naive, that the human being is really bad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was talking to my nephew, Sharif, in Egypt. And he said &quot;I&#39;m the only one in Egypt.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He really is a believer.

We just mention the Creator.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is restoring the religion. So&#1608; you are a first generation. Does this make you special or not? When you&#39;re the only one in Tehran who&#39;s Praying the correct way. Tehran is how many millions? Five?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can see the details but this circle here, you start on this side.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You put down the first, start with the first verse of Quran. And write the number of every verse in Quran. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first Sura is 7 verses. Then, put 7, the number of verses in the Sura. And then do the same with every Sura all the way to the end of Quran, only in the upper half.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then... Ok. Let me do it the other way around. Start with the number of verses in the Sura, 7.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, the number of each verse. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. And then you will link with the other system where you put the verses first and then the number later.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ok. You will end up with a number that is in a circle that is 25,400 approximately digits, numbers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This number is one mile long. And it is divisible by 19 and it has all the numbers in the Quran with the two systems.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One system where you put the number of verses at the end of the list of verses. Another system, you put the total number of verses at the beginning.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And in between the two systems, you have the number of the verses in the whole Quran. It&#39;s gonna be in the circle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This eventually is going to convert the whole world because they will know that this book is not human made.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean the miracles are becoming so strong now that they will be irresistible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, we may be a very special... you&#39;re still a very special group, generation because you&#39;ve been here even before this miracle was half this strong.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is growing now. And 50 years from now, it&#39;s gonna be very common knowledge.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">People will accept it easier because there&#39;ll be more people talking about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These people told Mahmoud &quot;we don&#39;t believe in mathematics.&quot; They didn&#39;t even look at it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But as they jump in the wagon, they will look at it and they will see it and they will know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They will just believe. They will know that this is God&#39;s message to the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the later generations for us may be different from the others. Dr. Khalifa: There are only 300 years left.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Sabahi: As if God is saying that (unintelligible). Dr. Khalifa: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: This has been the system. You see, Christianity was corrupted 300 years after Jesus.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, totally corrupted. They had the Nicene Conferences and they invented the Trinity and everything, 300 years after Jesus.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With Muhammad, it was 300 years that the Hadith became recorded and Islam was wiped out, totally corrupted 300 years after Muhammad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now with our generation, when it is 300 years, it&#39;s gonna be the end of the world.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is documented here in the Quran. So, we have a special situation here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Also, we have a verse in Quran in 41:53 that says, [41:53] We will show them our signs in the horizons, and within themselves, until they realize that this is the truth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is a prophecy that God gave us. And this is what&#39;s happening now. And it will take 300 years for the world to realize,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">probably every single person on earth will realize that this is God&#39;s message to the world. And I suspect the world will end with only believers on earth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s when Satan will throw up his hands and say &quot;I give up. I have no constituents anymore.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that will be the end, end of the test. The miracle is very powerful.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is the very reason why you are very special people because you believed from the very beginning.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some of you, even without looking at the miracle, you agreed to worship God alone and uphold the Quran alone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s a very special situation. Dr. Khalifa: I stole the show from Naghmeh. Naghmeh: Right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: I thought it was very important. I wanted you to know who you are.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: (unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Does it mean that there is also stratification within this... Dr Khalifa: Yes, within each (unintelligible), yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: (unintelligible) sorry. Dr. Khalifa: But you can call this Hell. And there&#39;ll be (unintelligible) there in the deepest... The hypocrites will be in the deepest pit of Hell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hypocrites are people who think they are believers. They say they&#39;re believers. They believe they are believers. But they are not.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those are the hypocrites. But the whole place is Hell. This is what...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And God says &quot;those who barely miss Hell and make it into the lowest layer of the Purgatory&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God calls this &quot;a fantastic triumph.&quot; Because if you miss this, this thing called Hell, within which there are different layers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The same with the Lower Heaven and the same with the High Heaven. Because the people in the Purgatory, they cannot go much higher, but they are fantastically happy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are in Heaven. And within Heaven, like I said, there will be a line beyond which you cannot go.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These are natural borders. Your growth and development will decide that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, every time you get abused and ridiculed, you grow immensely.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why Mahmoud came out smiling out of that episode.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So that Muhtesem...

A woman: He&#39;s not going to law school, but he works in a library. One time he went like this. It was like almost he hit me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:03:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible) A woman: He was...and he... Dr. Khalifa: Does he worship God alone, right?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: And he was like, he was like &quot;Dr. Khalifa says that it&#39;s OK for you to repent. Muslims don&#39;t have the right to repent.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: I was like &quot;Excuse me?!&quot; That&#39;s exactly what he said. He said &quot;God doesn&#39;t tell us we have the right to repent. And he tells us that you can repent a hundred times.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: And I&#39;m like &quot;of course, you can. Without repenting, we&#39;ll all go to Hell. Are you kidding?&quot; Dr. Khalifa: But that&#39;s in the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: I guess he never read the Quran. A woman: Oh, so many other things. And he&#39;s like &quot;you need a Muslim husband who will teach you how it is.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I said &quot;I&#39;ll teach him how it is.&quot; So, yes, I beat him, too.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: That&#39;s what he needs. A woman: I said &quot;I&#39;ll teach him.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: That&#39;s our love. A woman: Yeah. Dr. Khalifa: Let me tell you the kind of ridicule and the kind of stupidity they have. I have it obtained here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This fellow came from Denver, Colorado.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:04:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he wants to talk to me. So, I said &#39;if you have any place for us to talk, we&#39;ll talk to you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I said.... anyway, the conversation ended by me challenging him to say &quot;La Elaha Ella Allah.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m really convinced they cannot do it. I mean, I really know this now. Ihsan was listening.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I told him &quot;you are forbidden by God from saying La Elaha Ella Allah.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He said &quot;are you crazy or something? Of course, I can say La Elaha Ella Allah.&quot; I said &quot;go ahead. Say it.&quot; I said &quot;say it.&quot; Remember?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he will say &quot;La Elaha Ella Allah, Muhammad Rasulallah.&quot; I said &quot;see? You cannot say it. Can you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He said &quot;of course, I can say it.&quot; I said &quot;go ahead. Say it.&quot; He said &quot;La Elaha Ella Allah, Muhammad Rasulallah.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I said &quot;see? You just proved to me that you cannot say La Elaha Ella Allah, can you? Because you are forbidden by God.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, here I&#39;m challenging this guy to say &quot;La Elaha Ella Allah,&quot; and he cannot say it. I have it all recorded from the thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:05:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, so, this is, this is a fellow I kept challenging, and again, I guess he got so mad, so half hour later,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Dr. Rashad Khalifa receives a death threat. Within Hell there are ranks.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he called and he said &quot;I&#39;m gonna bring the gun and kill you tonight.&quot; Yeah, I have it. I have it on tape.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, now he&#39;s so stupid because he talks at the machine, we&#39;re recording it, along with his phone number and everything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, of course, we called the police. The police went and paid him a visit. But that&#39;s how, that&#39;s how stupid, how angry he gets.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Would you threaten somebody and record it on the machine?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:06:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His address was divisible by 19. But this is the kind of abuse, the kind of ridiculing that every time you go through this, you grow immensely. This is a very special treat to you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If Naghmeh and Apamea did not have the courage, they would have quit long time ago.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, from cousins to brothers to uncles, relatives, aunts, everywhere, friends.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&#39;re ridiculing them. Look at them, steady, persevering.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(unintelligible) God takes the believers out of darkness into the light.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And how can you go back to darkness after you&#39;ve lived in the light?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They cannot say &quot;La Elaha Ella Allah.&quot; (unintelligible). I know they are forbidden by God from saying it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They are hypnotized by Satan or whatever the (unintelligible) is.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, within the High Heaven, there are ranks. And within the Lower Heaven, there are ranks. And within Hell, there are ranks.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:07:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But these are the general divisions. As we saw in Sura 55, there are big differences between the High Heaven and the Lower Heaven.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But what we have seen are the general characteristics.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Congratulations. Dr. Sabahi: Can I ask a question? Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Dr. Sabahi: Is it (unintelligible) Quran that (unintelligible)? Dr. Khalifa: No.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: No, there will be, there will be more believers than ever now. By the way, some people that were kind of suspicious of my population.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And God never let me down. (unintelligible) Magazine, the last issue, had an article of the population.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They had a population curve there. It is in full agreement with my history.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:08:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: So, this is good. A woman: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: Yeah. A woman: ...the growing generations including us with a bar?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Right. Dr. Khalifa: Because I showed that the people from now to the end of the world will be 15 times as many as the people from the beginning of Adam until now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In other words, the vast majority of the human race are getting the message that our generation is beginning right now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or starting a message of worshipping God alone, upholding God&#39;s Word alone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is the message that God wills for the vast majority of the human race.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">70 billion people. See, until now we had 6 billion people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From now to the end of the world, it is projected that we&#39;ll have 70 billion people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But to answer Dr. Sabahi&#39;s question, the verse in the Quran says,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it doesn&#39;t say that everyone will be a believer, but it says &quot;I will show them My signs until they realize that this is the truth.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:09:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the prophecy is that God will spread His signs until everybody becomes a...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not everybody, maybe everybody, but at least almost everybody will be a believer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The miracles that we are seeing now, and they have all discovered the people connected with us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The people who believe exactly as we do. And this is an exclusive, specifically a very strong sign.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And these miracles will be known by everyone. I&#39;m telling you, in 50 years, there&#39;ll be millions, millions of people worshipping God alone and following the Quran alone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Millions, in just 50 years, maybe less. Naghmeh: You know, what I was gonna say also, it&#39;s not only that we&#39;re gonna have more people</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">later who are gonna be seeing these miracles, but also there&#39;s another mercy I think from God in that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:10:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the old generation, there might not have been as many people as we&#39;re gonna have. But the life span then was, what, 35 or 40 years old. Women died in labor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Naghmeh: There was the wars between Spain and, you know, the Europe and stuff. They were all young people. Dr. Khalifa: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Naghmeh: And so, you know, it seems like there was mercy there too, because they were all young and they died young. Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Naghmeh: Yeah. Right. Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Go ahead. Naghmeh: Okay, The Lower Heaven, 27.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[56:27] As for the inhabitants of the right side, they will be on the right side.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[56:28] They will enjoy lush orchards. [56:29] And fresh fruits. [56:30] And abundant shade. [56:31] And water to be poured.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[56:32] And many fruits. [56:33] Always in season. [56:34] And exalted furnishings. [56:35] We raise spouses for them. [56:36] Never previously touched. [56:37] Magnificent companions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:11:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[56:38] Exclusively reserved for inhabitants of the right side. [56:39] Multitudes from the early generation. [56:40] And multitudes from the later generations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay, number 27. This we see, the difference between this is from the far ahead to the right side.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, you know, we&#39;ve said it over and over again. Well, we know that the people who died before the age of 40</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">go in the Lower Heaven. And we know that the basic rules in the Quran to make the Lower Heaven is</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to believe in God alone, to work righteousness, and to believe in the Hereafter. And those people will make it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, then the right side just sounds so right, sounds so right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because first of all, like we know from, you know, the (unintelligible) that we always play is that God knows everything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God knows the one who is really, really, really mean and bad and He will keep them until they&#39;re old.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, but the ones who died before they are 40, obviously God knew that there was something right about them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:12:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And just because, you know, their life was shorter than ours doesn&#39;t mean that it was any kind of bad, you know, thing from God&#39;s position.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that maybe they were gonna prove a test for their family or whatever. But that the thing is that God knew they were on the right side.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And God tells us that the age of 40, you know, before the age of 40, they go to the Lower Heaven.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, and it just makes sense that those are the people who died before that age. And plus, it&#39;s a test for their families.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But they are still, they&#39;re so protected. And so if you&#39;re on the right side here, you&#39;ll be on the right side there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You won&#39;t be up at the top of the people who really tried hard. But you&#39;ll be there. And also I think a lot of times, you know, there are a lot of people who believe in God alone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They believe in the Hereafter and they work righteousness. But it&#39;s just way too difficult to ask them to do anything else.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:13:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They might give to charity but, you know, on their own, a lot of people maybe do. But they probably don&#39;t even give money or anything, but old clothes type of things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Naghmeh: But... Dr. Khalifa: God says He will reward them for their righteousness. Naghmeh: Right. You know, so it&#39;s some kind of charity. But they will not do the Prayer. It&#39;s too hard.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They say &quot;I can see myself doing one but five&quot;, you know. And... And, and I&#39;m like &quot;you&#39;re not doing any, you know, God doesn&#39;t need you to be doing this. It&#39;s for us.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, &quot;and you&#39;re not doing any favors for God for doing your prayer, but that it&#39;s a favor for us.&quot; And over all that, to think 25 minutes maybe out of your whole day, 24 hours, is really nothing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I hate to think of it as that but sometimes it just brings you down just saying that. But anyways...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible). A woman: I know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:14:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Naghmeh: So, but I guess they&#39;re just right on... Dr. Khalifa: The Prayers, the Prayers are meals. When they say &quot;one Prayer maybe but not five&quot;, this means, it&#39;s like saying, I just have breakfast.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Naghmeh: Yeah. Dr. Khalifa: Nothing else. Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible) But whatever righteous thing, work you do, you get rewards.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Again, we&#39;re gonna hear some allegorical things. There&#39;s gonna be some difference from the Highest Heaven.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&#39;s gonna be shade and there&#39;s gonna be fresh fruits, but it doesn&#39;t say what they choose.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It doesn&#39;t say what they desire but there will be fresh fruits. And it says,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">[56:31] And water to be poured. which means poured, I guess, from them because it doesn&#39;t say that they will have servants.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, that means a little bit more work for those people. But they will be taken care of, basically.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t understand why it says here [56:35] We raise spouses for them. But in the other one, it says that they will automatically have, like, you know, magnificent spouses.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:15:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What&#39;s the difference between raising spouses for the right...? Dr. Khalifa: It&#39;s like, if you can go to the market and get a meal of corn, or you can put a seed in there and watch it grow until it&#39;s a tree of corn.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:16:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Naghmeh: Oh, that is great.

So, we just know that, you know, multitudes from the early generations, that could be the people, you know, who,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Naghmeh: the younger, yeah, Dr. Khalifa: Children, Children. Naghmeh: the ones who died before the age of 40, because in the earlier generations, they died at a young age, and then the multitudes from the later generations could be the ones, all the people who follow us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: But because this happens all the time, no matter what is happening, it could be Abraham&#39;s generation, or Muhammad&#39;s generation, all the generations, but still, children die in accidents,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:17:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">people die before 40.

Why should a person want to go to college and get an education, or make money, or all these things?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because in retrospect, they&#39;re not really important. All that&#39;s important in this life is our relationship to God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And realizing that, that&#39;s when these other things can become important, because a wealthy</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">8:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">believer, he said, can do more good than a poor believer.

Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Okay, I think the custom of exchanging the wife as if she is the mother, is kind of unfair to the wife,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">especially in a society where there is polygamy. One wife is left hanging.

And in verse 3, we see the Quran&#39;s solution to the slave problem, where slavery was practiced.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was practiced in this country until 200 years ago. 200 or what? 100 years ago?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">12:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the Quran&#39;s method is the most effective and the best method economically, because</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">if you free half a million slaves all at once, there will be problems. They will not be able to handle it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the Quran made it for expiation, or atonement for sins.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, to be (unintelligible). And Robert said we don&#39;t have any slaves, so it works.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The guy who was sitting in a bus or something who was just clapping like this. Somebody asked &quot;what are you clapping for?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">13:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, he said &quot;this keeps the elephants away.&quot; The guy said &quot;But there are no elephants...

Sometimes, it&#39;s the wife&#39;s problem, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But fairness is common sense.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: It&#39;s all common sense.

It&#39;s actually happening now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I was in Saudi Arabia, I would listen to... They have a radio program where people write letters and complain.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is their way of getting the solution, of getting somebody&#39;s attention. And you would be amazed how many problems there are where wives are locked up for months.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">15:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They don&#39;t even see their husband. But they sneak out a letter somehow to the radio station.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s a program that makes you cry. It&#39;s a problem (unintelligible). So, this is the kind of problem that these verses address.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a form of slavery, and maybe this is why the expiation is to free a slave.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then, Robert said, there are no slaves now, but the Quran provides alternatives.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you don&#39;t have a slave, you go find a slave, and you free him, or free her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if this is not possible, it is not possible now, then you fast two consecutive months,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">which is indicative of the grossness of the offense. This is...This is...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you kill somebody by mistake, this is the expiation for killing somebody by mistake.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">16:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And if you cannot fast two consecutive months, then you have to feed 64 people. Just the same as Ramadan. If you cannot fast in the month of Ramadan, you feed one poor person, for every day you break the fast.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, you can see the work of existence of God is good.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is for you to believe in God and His messengers. These are God&#39;s laws.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because people who adhere to these commandments prove that they believe in God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And when we follow the commandments, we attain certainty.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The obligations, as Robert mentioned, these obligations are not for God&#39;s benefit, but for our benefit.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the most, the best thing out of those obligations is attaining certainty.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">17:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When you do the five Prayers, if you miss a Prayer, you get a pinch immediately. Eventually, it&#39;s gonna sink in our head that God has (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How does one know that they missed a Noon Prayer? So, it happens gradually. You&#39;re gonna have this conviction and this certainty.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Another thing I want to comment on is no people meet without God being there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: What verse it was? Robert: 7. Dr. Khalifa: [58:7] Do you not realize that GOD knows everything in the heavens and the earth? No three people can meet in secrecy without Him being their fourth,...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, when God says, He protects you and people who are conspiring to do harm to you, God is there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God&#39;s angels are there, too. But I want us to visualize God is with us. God is here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">18:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And subconsciously think that God is here. Do the snap. He knows that you&#39;re studying His Word.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Believing in the invisible dimension. God&rsquo;s protection. Being united, those who &ldquo;break away from the group Satan attacks&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s an awesome feeling. But we have to acquire it once in a while. We have to realize that God is here. God is with us. Always.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And as believers, this is also... Believing in the invisible is very important.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just because we are in this dimension and we see each other, we can&#39;t ignore that other dimension.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The invisible dimension.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Behind each one of you, or next to you, is a big, huge, invisible giant protecting you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m laughing because there was a... I just glanced at the TV the other day and there was a child with a dragon, invisible dragon.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They have something like this video. So, nobody can harm you. Nothing can harm you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">19:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it&#39;s just not, not just being conscious of God, but also being conscious of the guards. God put to guard you and guard your children and guard all your affairs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Prohibiting the Conspiracy. God says in Sura 42, the whole Sura is titled &quot;Consultation.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And this is... Alhamdu Lillah, we already achieved this. We&#39;re all just one unit.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we all become one family. Day after day, Friday after Friday, we are the same people who are meeting here. Dedicated.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s been wonderful. We&#39;ve just become a family. So, we don&#39;t have this problem anymore. Except that God taught us what this is in the past.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">20:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And (unintelligible) to take a boat (unintelligible) Opposition.

No, but that was opposition. (unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ok. I forget. But we did see examples of this and as time went by, the people who did these kinds of conspiracies turned out to be unbelievers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They just didn&#39;t have it. They never saw the miracle. They never appreciated it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they disappeared. That was years ago.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">21:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this verses 8 and 9 remind us of being always a united group.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our affairs based on consultation.

This is a certain piece of information on the side.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From computer facts, this is the only Sura in the Quran where the name of God is in every verse.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">22:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At least once. This Sura here.

Oh, my goodness.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Alright. Here&#39;s another piece of information.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, these are the fine details that we are blessed to know,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">when the average so-called Muslim doesn&#39;t even know how many Suras are in the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ok. I thought you were saying something.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ok, if there are no questions we&#39;ll go back to Robert. Oh, Abdullah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">23:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Abdullah: On 7, when God says &quot;there are no three people can meet in secrecy, without Him being the fourth.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, next one. Literally, it should come up like &quot;nor four people being, without being Him the fifth&quot;,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">but jumped to &quot;five.&quot; Actually, when you read it, you can&#39;t really notice it, because it goes three, four, five, six.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Abdullah: But the thing is, we know that, actually these numbers are counted, because if it was four and five, then the sum of the numbers will be short.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Exactly. Abdullah: A couple of numbers. But the way God put it, you can&#39;t really notice it, if you read it a million times.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">See, it&#39;s so fluent. (unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">24:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: How come it didn&#39;t say &quot;two people, God will be the third&quot;, and so on? Because these numbers, what God is emphasizing is that the numbers are part of the mathematical code.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the total is a multiple of 19, the number of numbers and the total of the numbers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Abdullah: Actually, the reason that God didn&#39;t start from two is because the verse ends with, it says &quot;nor less than this, nor more.&quot; Dr. Khalifa: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Abdullah: If it starts with two, there is no less of two, because you can&#39;t have one people conspiring.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Unless you are schizophrenic. Conspiring with yourself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Very good point. M&atilde; Sh&atilde; All&atilde;h. You see, nor less than this, nor more, covers the whole range of numbers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">25:52</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it&#39;s true. If the verse starts with two, then less than that would be one conspiring with who!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Sabahi: (unintelligible) of the messenger.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Sabahi: Why does (unintelligible) disobedience of God and messenger?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Well, apparently, the word &quot;conspiracy&quot; is against the messenger, in particular.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">See, this verse is dealing with conspiracy. [58:9] O you who believe, if you have to confer secretly, you shall not confer to commit sin, transgression, and disobedience to the messenger. You may confer only to work righteousness and piety. Beware of God,...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s a specific commandment dealing with conspiring against the messenger.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Sabahi: Does it mean that obedience of the messenger is required (unintelligible)?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">26:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Well, it&#39;s a blessing, yes. See, what is happening, when there is a messenger, God is sending information to the whole group through the messenger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Saves a lot of trouble&rdquo; if we obey the messenger. Community of Submitters debated age of 40, wastes a lot of time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the messenger himself is benefiting from this information. So, it will save us a lot of trouble if we obey him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This includes the messenger and the people, because this information comes to everybody.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Actually, I see this in my last trip to Canada, for example.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mentioned the issue of the age of 40, and I assumed that everybody accepted it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:35</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But they didn&#39;t, and I ended up wasting so much time on it. And it&#39;s a blessing if the people have the understanding of, for example, this verse.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&#39;d be so comfortable if they have the conviction and understanding. They will not waste so much time arguing back and forth, you know.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">27:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why 40? How can a person who is terrified go to Heaven if he didn&#39;t do this and that?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:01</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ok. But it&#39;s a piece of information that God sent to us and gave us the proofs and the evidence and a number from the Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, a person who has, who is blessed... God says &quot;it&#39;s a blessing&quot; because it saves us a lot of time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s finished. It&#39;s closed. Ok. When we say &quot;God says &quot;up to 40, everybody goes to Heaven.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And here&#39;s the number in the Quran. And here are the proofs. Here are the signs.&quot; Then, we&#39;re convinced.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it&#39;s a blessing. So, I appreciate the fact that this verse deals specifically with disobedience to the messenger.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s obedience in matters that have to do with God and the information that&#39;s coming from God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s not personal obedience. It&#39;s obedience to God because it&#39;s the information that&#39;s coming from God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">28:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we have in history... the history tells us they were having a battle or something and the Prophet Muhammad said &quot;let us camp here.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they went to him and they said &quot;this is information from you or from God?&quot; &quot;If it&#39;s from God, we&#39;ll do that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He said &quot;no, it&#39;s from me.&quot; They said &quot;this is a stupid idea.&quot; (unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, once he said &quot;it&#39;s from me&quot;, they were free not to obey.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, the obedience is really to God. This is actually written in history. &quot;Then, we&#39;re all dead if we obey you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they did move on to some other place.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">29:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: (unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Okay, we&#39;ll... just we do have a part where we ask general questions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, that falls under the general questions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">30:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have to let Robert finish.

When these things happened, people went and they had their own Quranic study.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For example, they came out with the strangest conclusions, from the same Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can tell you that Satan gets hold of them or something, confusing every issue for them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And eventually, I will remember some of the ideas that came out. Cause they are very strange ideas.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">34:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And you know, it makes sense. (unintelligible) inferences &quot;That&#39;s right, you can derive this meaning from this verse. But that&#39;s not what it says.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you twist words, you can come up with certain meanings. So hopefully, I will remember some specific examples.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But when people... It says here, actually. &quot;Conspiracy is from the devil.&quot; There we go.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ok. &quot;Conspiracy is from the devil.&quot; And these people who forced their opinion, and they went to study the Quran,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m remembering some of the ideas.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Abdullah: Oh, yes. Dr. Khalifa: Oh, yes. Oh, my God. Abdullah: Oh, my God. Dr. Khalifa: Now, listen to this. Now, you&#39;re gonna get a kick out of this. Yeah. Thank you. You reminded me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:46</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The word, they said that Saleh... Yeah, this came out of their group.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">35:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The old timers will remember this. They said... now Saleh said &quot;this is God&#39;s camel. Let it be, have its own drink some places.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:03</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then they slaughtered the camel. So, the word... now people underaged, excuse us, but they said that they had sex with the camel.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By (unintelligible) the camel. A man: What?! A woman: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: That&#39;s what came out of their group.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Abdullah: They&#39;re very sick. You&#39;re right. Dr. Khalifa: Is this what I said?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I said &quot;where did you get that?&quot; They said &quot;the word did not mean...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They wanted a specific word that means slaughtering. And actually, the word is specific enough, but it is not a common word.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, this is one of the examples that &quot;Conspiracy is from the devil.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And they actually came back and they argued with me. They said &quot;why do you translate it as they slaughtered the camel?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:51</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, we really are living the Quran. &quot;Conspiracy is from the devil.&quot; Obviously, the devil gave them that idea.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">36:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Also, the people were reading from the... They were translating from the Arabic to English. They were not using this?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: I think they used both. They used Arabic and English. They had some other translations. A man: And they were using it all together?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Yes, they have. Actually, you must be a fool to have that idea.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Martha, you know Arabic. The word is &#1601;&#1614;&#1593;&#1614;&#1602;&#1614;&#1585;&#1615;&#1608;&#1575;&#1759; &#1593;&#1614;&#1602;&#1614;&#1585;&#1615;&#1608;&#1575;&#1759; And the word is &#1593;&#1614;&#1602;&#1614;&#1585;&#1615;&#1608;&#1575;&#1759;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This is &quot;slaughtering the camel.&quot; So, the word in the Quran,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">what they did, the camel was slaughtered. So, they said &#1593;&#1614;&#1602;&#1614;&#1585;&#1615;&#1608;&#1575;&#1759; means</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&#39;re having sex with the camel. They&#39;re not killing it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perverts.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">37:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Conspiracy is from the devil.&quot; You know, this is what happens if we separate ourselves from the believers.

Can we let Robert finish these?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:13</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Robert: I just... Should I just read this last verse? Because you wanted to discuss the other... Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Robert: Yeah. And then...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A woman: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible) Robert: Oh, that&#39;s all right. There&#39;s only one verse left. Dr. Khalifa: Go ahead. Robert: Ok.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:28</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Verse 22. Run For Your Life [58:22] You will not find people who believe in GOD and the Last Day befriending those who oppose GOD and His messenger, even if they were their own parents, or children, or siblings, or family.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God places faith into their hearts as He supports them with inspiration. He will admit them into the gardens with flowing streams where they abide forever. GOD is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him. They are the party of GOD. And the party of God are winners.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">49:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This verse is incredibly strong. I think, just from looking at Mr. Khalifa&#39;s own situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This really truly proves, if you&#39;re a believer, if you can ally yourself with God, even when your family is an obstacle for you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s, that&#39;s truly showing that you&#39;re a believer. That is confirming to yourself when you can put God above all things, especially someone that&#39;s so close as your family.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And when those people feel that they are doing the right things themselves.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:39</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God is the one. As you go back &quot;in God, the believers shall trust.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:45</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That says it all right there. And you have to put God above everything else, regardless of who it is.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">50:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And to do this is oftentimes very difficult. But if you truly believe, then you&#39;ll be in the party of God, who are winners.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Follower talks of his experience and journey to Submission.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man: Is there anything else? A man: No, this, this answers your question earlier on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:12</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You asked about the people that oppose the messenger.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:17</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And here it is. The verse says [58:22] You will not find people who believe in GOD and the Last Day befriending those who oppose GOD and His messenger,...</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:30</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Keikhosrow Emami: We have not, in any kind of a way, been forced to practice religion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:37</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rather, open-minded family, I&#39;m proud of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:43</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But in my heart, I&#39;ve been always searching. I told Dr. Khalifa, I was 16 years old when I felt like I wanna go to a masjid.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I did. The second time I went to the masjid, I was turned off.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">51:59</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because it wasn&#39;t for me. Things that I heard, it was not simply logical.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:07</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, I&#39;m 46 now, but I&#39;ve been growing up. I&#39;ve gone through so much. You know, you all know how we go through the steps.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We get busy with other matters. We come and go.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:20</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But one thing never went away from me, it was my thirst for God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:31</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then later on, I got very, very interested in Quran. I don&#39;t know the reason, but I was just very interested.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It sounds a little off. A man comes from Tehran, Iran, and he finds God in the United States of America.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">52:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I call that destiny. It was in 1983, or perhaps, I believe it was 1983.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Somehow, some kind of a way, I came across with 1 and 9.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Makes it number 19. And I was fascinated. I was fascinated. That&#39;s why I went ahead and got a Quran and I was</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">going around and bragging about it. &quot;Hey guys,...&quot; actually, I was talking to a Jewish fellow one time,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Iranian guy, and I didn&#39;t know he was Jewish. And I was telling him &quot;look, look, what do you want? I mean, this is it. This is it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he even didn&#39;t tell me he was Jewish. Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa: Go on. Dr. Khalifa: Go ahead. Keikhosrow Emami: So, But as I said, as it comes and it goes, the first wave didn&#39;t knock me out, but just warmed me up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">53:55</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And, but again, I&#39;m in transportation business. If you all ever come to Atlanta, you can ask who KE is. They call me KE.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:04</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I owned the second largest taxi fleet in town, but I sold it. Of course, and I&#39;m happy. I still have much to be thankful.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you ask them what his radio number is, they&#39;re gonna tell you &quot;it&#39;s 19.&quot; I have a property very close to downtown. It is on Highway 19.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:25</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And IN SHAA ALLAH, I&#39;ve got good plans. I&#39;m not coming to Tucson to live in here, but my goodness, I envy you in a way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My heart is with you. But I&#39;ll tell you one thing. You will come to the masjid in Atlanta, IN SHAA ALLAH.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:42</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a few months ago. Again, I don&#39;t know what happened. I was just, I wanted Quran again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:50</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, never gave it up, but this time I really wanted it. I mean, I wanted Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">54:56</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I went through my papers. I found the address of Masjid Tucson again, wrote a letter, asked for a few books, and I got them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:09</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But this time, it knocked me out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It knocked me out. I talked to Dr. Khalifa many times, a few times on the phone, actually. And I told him, when I was telling him,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:27</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I have no doubt. I never meant that I never doubted you.&quot; When I was saying, I said &quot;I don&#39;t doubt. I have no doubt that Quran is indeed that communication which is direct.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t know that he had made any announcement, actually, at the time. This came to me about 3 and a half, 3, max 4 weeks ago.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">55:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But let me say this to you. Without even the announcement, I was intelligent enough to see that, my goodness, there&#39;s got to be something.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, if you all sleep tonight, and tomorrow you see a flying saucer in here, in Tucson, Arizona,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:11</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and the crowds go around it, and there&#39;s no door, you can&#39;t figure it out. Then all of a sudden, somebody from the crowd steps forward, and he goes towards it, and does something, and the door opens,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and he gets in it, and he flies around, and maneuver around, and he lands it again,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">don&#39;t you believe that somehow those who made the flying saucer taught him something?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He got some kind of a training from them? It is simply simple logic.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, in the back of my mind, I was saying that, well, there&#39;s got to be something special. He&#39;s blessed. He&#39;s blessed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">56:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, it was February publication, Muslim Perspectives, when I got it, and it says &quot;Give me only one reason.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:08</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dr. Khalifa, that was the first time I looked at what you said. So, hey, I&#39;m fresh.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And &quot;only one reason. I&#39;ve produced so many Quranic evidences, proofs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:24</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You just give me one simple reason&quot;, and not for a second, you know, backed off, didn&#39;t back off, even though I was expecting it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, I loved it. I loved it, and I loved him, too.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:38</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I just decided, I said &quot;hey, Khosrow, don&#39;t overdo it. Don&#39;t love him too much.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:44</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because I&#39;ll be just as, just as guilty, probably, I&#39;ll make another Jesus Christ, or Prophet Muhammad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">57:54</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You see, you go through these things, and things do make sense. They asked Prophet Muhammad &quot;bring a ladder, go up to the heaven, bring the whole book together, show it to us.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The miracles are performed, of course, but again, miracles come on in all different forms and fashions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:16</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am simply overwhelmed. I have a good friend of mine, Andy Mote, and we were talking with a couple of Sunni Muslims</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:26</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and a couple of Shias, and the Sunnis asked, you know, they wanted to</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">at least eliminate some of the opposition to what they were saying. They said, well, he looks like blonde and American,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:40</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, you must be Christian.&quot; He says &quot;no, I&#39;m hoping to become a Muslim.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I am a believer. I have no doubt.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">58:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I said, two things I know. I don&#39;t expect him to perform miracles every second. I know he&#39;s a human.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:00</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I know he&#39;s gonna make mistakes. The rest of them did.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:06</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And I make sure that I control my emotions. I think I have overcome that. I will stay in Atlanta, and I think I have got my works cut up for me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:18</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think God has blessed me with a wonderful family.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:23</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t see I&#39;ve got any weaknesses. I&#39;m sure, but I think I&#39;m okay, and I&#39;m situated that I do good things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:33</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;ve got good plans. I am gonna be naturally communicating every step that I take with Dr. Khalifa and have his coaching and his approval.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:48</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And IN SHAA ALLAH, I&#39;m looking forward to good things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">59:57</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I feel God. An experience that I&#39;d like to share with you, I&#39;ve been always strong in my life.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:05</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My frame is not all that big, but even physically I&#39;ve been strong.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:14</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I cannot be intimidated. I do my Prayer regularly. Yes, since when?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:22</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I said &quot;well, yes, he is indeed the messenger.&quot; So, even when I was gonna Pray, I said &quot;no, I&#39;ve got to get to the point. I wanna know how</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:32</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I should Pray exactly&quot;, because the Prayer that I used to do was a little different, not whole lot.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:41</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, I waited until I got the tapes and everything. Since then, I have been Praying five times a day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:49</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And truly, like he says, that this Contact Prayer, it is not good for... It&#39;s not for God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:00:58</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is simply, you establish that contact. It is the way you nourish your own self, you, your true self.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:10</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I feed me, like I feed my garments, like I exercise to keep my body trim.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:15</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, therefore, I wanna exercise my mind and grow. I&#39;ve been talking to my wife lately, and she says &quot;Khosrow, you&#39;re beginning to sound like (unintelligible). I hope not.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:29</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is what I feel. It is my love for my family.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:36</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One thing I&#39;ve made clear that I love him so much, but definitely, for sure, God is number one.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:47</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The experience I had, like Dr. Khalifa said &quot;there&#39;s a giant next to you protecting you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:01:53</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anybody doubts that? Anybody is doubting that?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">1:02:02</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I go to the Masjid on 14th Street and do my Prayer. And since the time I Prayed...</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c7"></span></p><h1 class="c5 c1 c4" id="h.yldjteank7na"><span class="c8">26 Quran Study From Behrouz 1626 Sura 67 By Gatut Hamid Argues With Rashad</span></h1><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Gatut: (We seek) refuge in God from the rejected devil. Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">0:07</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">We are in Sura 67, Kingship (Al-Mulk).</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">0:15</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">[67:1] Most exalted is the One in whose hands is all kingship, and He is Omnipotent.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">0:23</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Well, I have to stop here. The verse says very clearly that in God is all the Kingship.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">0:33</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">So, Kingship means that He is the sole and the only authority in this whole universe.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">0:41</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">And He is also Omnipotent according to this verse. We also learn from the Quran that God grants Kingship to whomever He wills, and He grants it to the believers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">0:53</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">In other words, we know that people who worship God alone and follow God&#39;s commandment alone,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">1:03</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">God promised them that they will be sovereign, or. kings or queens on earth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">1:09</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">In other words, they have everything that they need.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">1:14</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Everything that they need will be in their fingertips without, you know, the headache of a celebrity</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">1:20</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">that we know, you know, needs bodyguards, protection from FBI, or you cannot go to Burger King</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">1:30</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">to eat if you want because that&#39;s the headache of being a celebrity. You have a prison on your own, but God&#39;s servants, the believers, have all this and can still</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">1:41</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">enjoy this, and they have anything that they want. And I think that&#39;s the biggest, you know,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">1:46</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">even the richest person in the world cannot do that because they will go everywhere and everybody</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">1:53</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">or some people or some news reporter will follow them. You know, Sam Donaldson will follow them</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">1:59</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">and ask questions and all that. So, the believers don&#39;t have that kind of headache.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">2:06</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">The same goes with the, you know, financial problems.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">2:11</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">They don&#39;t need 10 million dollars, but they have everything that they need.

They get anything that they need, good clothings, without being, you know,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">2:24</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">without worrying that the IRS will get into their pocket or something.

That means that it takes 26 billion years for light to travel.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">8:27</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Billions with a B. So, that&#39;s how awesome is the innermost universe.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">8:32</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">And there are six other universes around the innermost universe.

In Sura 72, verse 9, and also in Sura 15, verse 18, there&#39;s the same reference of, you know,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">9:15</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">the guard of the universe that, you know, the jinns and Satan cannot go beyond because they will be pursued by projectiles.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">9:27</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">But nobody can find any flaw in God&#39;s creation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">9:38</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">You know, we just look and lay down at a dark night when the moon is, you know, very young and look at the stars.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">9:46</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">I used to do camping a long time ago when I was young.

And yet, we cannot imagine how vast is the universe because until now there is no way</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">10:21</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">that we can even go to our closest neighboring star. And not to mention the neighboring galaxy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">10:30</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Verse 4 says this perfectly, [67:4] Look again and again; your eyes will come back stumped and conquered. And that&#39;s, at least that&#39;s my impression when I look at the stars.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">10:40</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">We also learn from verse 5 that the lowest universe, which is our universe, is adorned with lamps, which is stars.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">10:48</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">This is...

And we know that our sun is one of the stars.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">10:57</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">So, what is implied here is probably that only our universe has stars.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">11:02</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">So, we don&#39;t know how the outer universes, the second, the third universes look like.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">11:17</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">We also learn from this Sura in verse 7, 8 and 9, how terrible is the condition in Hell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">11:28</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">We know that Hell is reserved only for those people who go out of their way to reject</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">11:35</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">or deny God&#39;s Greatness. And therefore, when people go there, people go there on their own volition because</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">11:49</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">despite of all these warnings that God sent through the messengers, through the scriptures, and through all the signs that God manifested to the people, they still insist on going</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">11:59</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">there. And therefore, it&#39;s like they already deserve what they get over there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">12:04</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">But God explains here how terrible is the condition in hell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">12:10</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">It is like, Hell has its own personality. I mean, Hell has its own, Hell can be so angry towards the disbelievers because when the disbelievers were sent there</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">12:19</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">group by group, Hell can even, you know, sort of talk back to them. &quot;Suffer. What do you do? Why did you...?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">12:26</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">&quot;Can I have more?&quot; In some other verses in the Quran Hell says &quot;can I have more of these people?&quot; You know, because...</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">12:32</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">It&#39;s like, you know, a very, very savage beast. But Hell is simply the absence of God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">12:38</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">In other words, these people cannot stand to become close to God because they did not develop</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">12:44</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">their soul enough in this life. And therefore on the Day of Judgment, they have to run away from God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">12:50</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">They couldn&#39;t stand the presence of God. And that absence of God is really actually Hell.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">12:55</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Because in some of the verses in the Quran, we learn that Hell is also described by darkness, by hopelessness,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">13:03</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">also fire where people are roasted there and never die. So, there is no excuse for the disbelievers when they go there because they have been warned here</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">13:12</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">as, with, you know, as best allegory as human language can find.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">13:19</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">As a matter of fact, in verse 9, we know that disbelievers will, what is the word, they will accept the blame. This...</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">13:32</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">[67:9] ....&quot;Yes indeed; we had a warner, but we disbelieved and said, &#39;GOD did not reveal anything. You are totally astray.&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">13:39</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">And this is exactly what majority of the people will say when one quotes, you know, from the scripture, you know,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">13:46</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">one is conveying the word of God, they say &quot;we don&#39;t believe you. You are far off. You are strange.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">13:53</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">So, that&#39;s what they say in this life and in the Hereafter, they will admit that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">13:59</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">And they also said in verse 10 &quot;if we heard or understood, we would not be among the dwellers of Hell.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">14:04</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Thus in verse 11, they actually confess their sins.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">14:11</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">I think, if there&#39;s any questions or comments or anything, give it at the forum.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">14:37</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Gatut: Any comments or...?

You are denying everything from me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">32:45</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Hamid: And I&#39;m telling you I am able... Dr. Khalifa: Well, that&#39;s arrogance. This is what arrogance is. Hamid: No. No, no, no. That is not arrogance. That&#39;s ignorance. I&#39;m not ignorant. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. You cannot do anything to yourself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">32:53</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Hamid: I&#39;m telling you I can be... Hamid: See, you are very smart, very intelligent, more power to you. Hamid: But don&#39;t tell me... Well, if you say...</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">33:02</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Hamid: If you make that big decision between Satan and God, the rest of it is easy. Dr. Khalifa: This is what God is saying. This is what God is saying, not me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">33:08</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Hamid: I&#39;m telling you the belief is a revolving door. Dr. Khalifa: Do you believe God or not? Dr. Khalifa: Do you believe God? Ok. Hamid: It&#39;s a revolving door. Dr. Khalifa: Do you believe God or not? Hamid: Yes, I do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">33:14</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Dr. Khalifa: If you believe God, then you are wrong. Because God says if you make the decision to be with God, things will be easy for you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">33:20</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">And the rest will follow. Hamid: You know why? You know why? Dr. Khalifa: I can show it to you in the Bible. I can show it to you in the Quran. Hamid: Because as a concept, it&#39;s true.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">33:27</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Hamid: The concept is true. Dr. Khalifa: Ok. Hamid: God is Almighty. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Hamid: As I was, as I was telling these gentleman, and this, Dr. Khalifa: Ok. Now, we&#39;re talking.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">33:35</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Hamid: When you...when... Let&#39;s take it one enterprise as an example.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">33:40</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Hamid: Let&#39;s take one enterprise. You go to one big company and you are hired. Under circumstances, under particular circumstances, you are qualified for that job.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">33:50</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">But if you don&#39;t fulfill that expectation, which I put it to you at the first, at the beginning,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">33:57</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">you are fired, you are failed, and they very graciously will tell you &quot;go somewhere else.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">34:06</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">This is what we know what is expected from us. God is not going to interfere. It&#39;s not fair.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">34:13</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">He is not gonna interfere. If I pull a gun on you and say &quot;I&#39;m gonna kill you&quot;, He&#39;s not gonna interfere in that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">34:19</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Hamid: If otherwise you pull a gun on me, He is not going to interfere. Dr. Khalifa: You&#39;re wrong. You&#39;re wrong. (unintelligible) What Mahmoud says? Mahmoud.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">34:26</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Mahmoud: Well, at least this argument is something that in the last (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">34:34</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">But one thing that I wanna ask you is, one thing that you refer to, and that&#39;s the fact that</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">34:42</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">we know a lot of things about the Quran, about Islam, from hearing them, not</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">34:50</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">referencing them directly to the Quran. What I&#39;d like you to say is, whatever you&#39;re saying is the belief, to back it up with the Quranic verses.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">35:01</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Because we are, as you said, we are talking to someone who is intelligent, who is smart, and he knows Quran.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">35:08</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">So, if you wanna argue, or you wanna prove your point, at least I as a listener here,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">35:14</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">I wanna see your support, your reference. If you say it on the basis of the things that you have heard, and you believe it,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">35:24</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">without any reference to the Quran, then I have a hard time to believe it, to understand what you say or accept it, as a third party listening to both of you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">35:34</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">No matter whether I believe what he&#39;s saying, or what you say is true. If you wanna make the argument, and let it stay, at least make things clear for me,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">35:43</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">or for other people who are sitting here, and things are not clear. I expect you...</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">35:49</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Hamid: to back it up? Mahmoud: back it up with verses. Hamid: I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t do it. Hamid: I cannot even get close to his knowledge, his Quranic knowledge.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">35:56</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">But I am talking from common sense. Dr. Khalifa: No, no. (unintelligible) Mahmoud: That&#39;s... that is why</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">36:03</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Mahmoud: One more minute Mahmoud: That is why I found out when I came in here. A lot of things that I thought was common sense,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">36:09</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">because I&#39;m someone who do science, I always tried to refer everything to some</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">36:14</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">very strong reference, and this is the Word of God. So, if you believe in that, then we may have the common ground that this is the Word of God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">36:23</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">I do believe in God, as everybody else does, but the difference is interpretation. And we have, as I&#39;ve been and I do, a lot of bad things in the system, a lot of things that are hearsay,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">36:35</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">a lot of things that we have learned has gone to our system, and a lot of intellectual and radical interpretations, which is fine as social and economic issues.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">36:46</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">That&#39;s fine, but if I can&#39;t back it up with Quranic verses then I&#39;m not gonna get in my heart. At least...</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">36:54</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Dr. Khalifa: The other side of the coin is, if I cannot back it up, and I see something in the Quran, I have to submit to it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">37:00</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">You see, we&#39;re assuming that all these people here believe that the Quran is the truth. Once I show you something in the Quran, I expect you to say &quot;this is what God says, I accept it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">37:10</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">So, if you read Sura 65, verses 3, 4, and 5, and 6, it tells you that if you believe in God, things will be easy for you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">37:18</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">God will provide for you whence you never expect. If you read the Bible, it will tell you &quot;seek God&#39;s Kingship over you, and everything else follows.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">37:27</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">And there are many, many verses I can show you in the Quran, but if you follow common sense and logic, it doesn&#39;t work.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">37:34</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Robert? Robert: We discuss this, because, like you said, it&#39;s hard, especially, I don&#39;t know, the way I grew up,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">37:42</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">you learn, you always think you take responsibility for yourself and all these things,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">37:47</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">but in terms of, you&#39;re talking about the one big decision, I had a problem with that, because I saw one big decision. Well,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">37:54</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">how do you know when you make one big decision, that you choose this or that? Because lots of times,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">37:59</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">you know, you say, &quot;okay, yes, I believe in God&quot;, but a second later, you&#39;re doing something that is contrary to, you know, Quranic law, or something of that nature.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">38:12</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">When you make a big decision, you&#39;re creating a covenant with God, and you have to uphold,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">38:19</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">you know, when you choose God, you&#39;re choosing, you&#39;re not just saying &quot;well, okay, I choose God, everything else is gonna follow, because God is gonna control it, so then I don&#39;t have to get up and pray, I don&#39;t have to do nothing, because, you know, I choose God.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">38:31</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Robert: But when you choose God, you&#39;re choosing to be righteous. Hamid: Consequences. Hamid: There is a consequence. Robert: It&#39;s a system. You&#39;re creating a covenant with God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">38:37</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Robert: And all these things that the Quran says for you is to prove to yourself that God is controlling,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">38:44</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">controlling everything, that you&#39;re on the path to God, like praying and all these things. These are things for us to prove to ourselves that we have made the right decision.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">38:53</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">And that... Because God controls the people who choose to go the other direction, too.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">38:59</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">He says &quot;if you choose to go on Satan&#39;s path&quot;, He pushes you that way. He controls everything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">39:04</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">So, all these things, like studying, for example, which is totally irrelevant, well, God will provide for us to do certain things. He controls all matters.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">39:16</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">And like what Gatut was saying earlier about studying and not having to</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">39:25</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">worry, he was saying strictly that &quot;you don&#39;t have to worry when an exam comes&quot;, not necessarily you don&#39;t have to prepare, because God will control that, God will prepare you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">39:35</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">You know, God will make sure that you get something done. Like you said &quot;God instills in you the desire to study&quot;, so that you are prepared. You don&#39;t have to worry about it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">39:44</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">God will provide for you. God controls all these things on the basis of your covenant with Him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">39:50</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Hamid: Because it is the nature of human being. I was just saying, it&#39;s a peace of mind. If you are worrisome and in disarray, you cannot achieve much.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">39:58</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">You can go and stay in a library for hours and hours, but your mind is somewhere else.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">40:04</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">But if you have that mind, that peace of mind, then you can achieve it. Robert: God, God... Hamid: So, that is...</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">40:12</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Hamid: I agree with you. He is Almighty. But He is not gonna interfere in daily basis. Dr. Khalifa: Yes, yes Robert: He controls everything, everything. A man: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">40:20</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Dr. Khalifa: Even the words you are saying. Dr. Khalifa: Ali. W. are running out of time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">40:28</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Dr. Khalifa: Thank God He interferes. He does everything in this world. Ali: When I was back in Iran, and my dad sat on the campus (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">40:38</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">And I was always warned to believe in God and stuff like that. And at school, they made us pray. They made sure we prayed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">40:45</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">And I always went to it and sometimes, you know, I would just volunteer and try to lead it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">40:51</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">And there is a part of the Prayer in Iran where you put your hands up like this and you say some things about Ali or Muhammad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">40:59</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">I always forgot things. I could never remember. Dr. Khalifa: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">&ldquo;God is doing everything&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">41:05</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Ali: I would always skip it. I would remember everything else, but I would skip that. I don&#39;t know why.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">41:10</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">I would try to remember. I would tell myself, try to remember in the beginning, but I would just skip it. You know, unless somebody else was leading.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">41:17</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">But I would go down and I would do the thing and if my friend was there or somebody, he would say it loudly, so I would do it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">41:23</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">But I always skipped it. And I always... Hamid: But if you forget it, there is no credit. But if you did it consciously, then there is some credit.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">41:31</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Dr. Khalifa: No,... A man: No, no, no. Dr. Khalifa: God says it in the Quran. A man: No, no, you do it in your Prayers so many times. Hamid: But God told him to forget it? Dr. Khalifa: Absolutely. A woman: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">41:39</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Dr. Khalifa: See, the words you are saying now. Dr. Khalifa: It is not even funny. God is doing everything. It&#39;s not even funny.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">41:44</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Even the words you&#39;re uttering, the encounters you have every day. Ali: Right and right now, I&#39;m going... you know, right now, I mean, school and stuff, I am running for my class presidency.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">41:58</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Right now, there are a lot of people more popular than me and stuff. I&#39;m not worried because I know God is on my side, but it doesn&#39;t mean that I&#39;m not gonna work hard.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">42:06</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">I&#39;ve been working hard. I&#39;m trying to get posters out. I&#39;m working really hard on my speech. But if I know that God is on my side, I&#39;m not worried.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">42:12</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">I know that I can win if I work hard with Him on my side. But God will provide the stuff for me, the slogans, how the speech will come.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">42:22</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Dr. Khalifa: M&atilde; Sh&atilde; All&atilde;h. A woman: And how does... Dr. Khalifa: Douglas. Dr. Khalifa: Douglas. Douglas: One of the things we find in the Quran is God says &quot;those who believe and work righteousness.&quot; And that&#39;s the sequence.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">42:35</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">You cannot work righteousness unless you believe. A person can think they believe.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">42:41</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">The Quran says &quot;have you not seen those who follow their own opinions?&quot; The Quran speaks of human beings who think they have guidance, who think they have knowledge, when in fact they don&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">42:52</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">And all of us have at one time or another felt we know something or we know what to do in a situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">42:58</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">That sequence throughout the Quran &quot;those who believe and work righteousness&quot;,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">43:04</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">one of the things that it points out is that it is Allah&#39;s will, it is God&#39;s will that we work the righteousness,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">43:12</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">that He guides us to work the righteousness. We cannot do it on our own.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">43:18</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">So, to use the example of studying for the exam, a person who truly believes knows what God says in the Quran,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">43:26</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">that you must be responsible for your own actions in that sense and they will take that step.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">43:34</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">So, that sequence is very crucial, &quot;those who believe and work righteousness.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">43:39</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Dr. Khalifa: Chester. Jester: Also in the Quran, it says that God tests you daily and every time that you say something, you can make things go miserable for you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">43:48</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Isn&#39;t that also a test, you know? And when you&#39;re miserable, isn&#39;t that kind of a failed test? Because you would be happy if you didn&#39;t and if you listen, you believe in God because He makes things easier.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">43:58</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">I mean, God will give me (unintelligible), he just gave me a job today by having a (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Follower argues regarding Rapes, child abuse, etc&hellip;.&rdquo;rapes happen in Satan&rsquo;s kingdoms&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">44:03</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">I&#39;ve just been accepting things as they come along lately and things have become a lot easier.

Dr. Khalifa: The rapes, the rapes and ones who does all this are in Satan&#39;s world, not in God&#39;s world. Hamid: The last...

Hamid: I&#39;m saying if the speaker is bad, I have to either hire someone to fix it in advance</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">45:14</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Hamid: because I have it up here, I know it&#39;s not working.

No. Dr. Khalifa: God will send His angels to fix your stomach or your heart or your car or your speakers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">45:23</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Hamid: And the wife. Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Hussein: I have a question about verse 20, Gatut please. Going back to verse 20 of Sura 67, page 563. It&#39;s about the invisible soldier that you mentioned</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">45:42</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">the jinns or the angels, when the people were fighting the believers,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">45:50</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">or the disbelievers were fighting the believers, even when the number of believers,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">45:56</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">maybe, you know, ten, hundred times higher than the soldiers, the disbelievers were mostly (unintelligible).</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">46:06</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Dr. Khalifa: The believers always win. The believers always win. Hussein: Yeah, that&#39;s right. The believers always win. Dr. Khalifa: Yep. Hussein: And you mentioned about the invisible soldiers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">46:12</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Does this mean that we do not see the invisible soldiers and they do not exist physically</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">46:20</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">or do they take the gun and they shoot? Or this invisible soldier, what God meant was, again, that sacrifice, determination, hard fighting, not be afraid of anything, just in the front line?</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">46:36</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Dr. Khalifa: No, Hussein, they are mentioned in the Quran several times. Invisible soldiers means soldiers you cannot see.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">46:41</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">They are right in this room, but you cannot see them. Hussein: But how do they fight? Dr. Khalifa: They are very physical. Because they can carry this mosque and turn it upside down. How physical can you get?</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">46:50</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Hamid: They have never done it anywhere in the whole universe. Dr. Khalifa: They didn&#39;t do it to us. Hamid: You are putting a question, God can destroy this, but has He ever done it? Dr. Khalifa: Sodom and Gomorrah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">46:57</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Dr. Khalifa: Of course. Sodom and Gomorrah. Hamid: Not after the last revelation, because He just said, this is it. Dr. Khalifa: It&#39;s in the Quran. Hamid, Hamid, Hamid</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">47:02</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Dr. Khalifa: Read my lips. Read my lips. The angels turned Sodom upside down, the city. Hamid: Yeah, did I just tell you after the Prophet Muhammad, he said &quot;this is it&quot;?</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">47:10</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Now you have everything in your hand? Hamid: Before that, people asked Dr. Khalifa: I don&#39;t understand. Prophets &quot;we want some proof&quot;, like a miracle. And Moses threw his Dr. Khalifa: Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">47:20</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Hamid: stick and became a whatever, and open... Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Hamid: because people were not sophisticated, they were not at a higher echelon.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">47:27</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Hamid: Now, we are, we are in an enlightenment era. Dr. Khalifa: We never (unintelligible) right now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">47:33</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Dr. Khalifa: Yes. Hamid: The whole... Dr. Khalifa: So, what is your point? Hamid: If you&#39;re not getting it, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m saying this is it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">47:39</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Dr. Khalifa: If that&#39;s what you&#39;re saying, you&#39;re not following it. Hamid: He said &quot;the consequences... Hamid: (unintelligible) if you make that big decision, God will come and turn the TV for me, if I say &quot;well, listen, my legs are broken.&quot; Dr. Khalifa: You don&#39;t believe it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">47:49</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Hamid: And this guy says &quot;well, go and get a (unintelligible)... Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible) Dr. Khalifa: If you believe in God, (unintelligible) Hamid: I do believe in God, sir.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">47:55</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">(unintelligible) Hamid: But I also believe in my intelligence.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">48:01</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Gatut: See, the Quran says, the Quran says that we have to kill our ego, because that is usually the last idol. Dr. Khalifa: Our teacher... Go ahead.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">48:08</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Hamid: What that has to do with the price of tea in China? Gatut: I am saying that. Hamid: I&#39;m talking about my...</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">48:14</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Hamid: Did I talk... I said &quot;please believe in yourself, God will guide you.&quot; Gatut: No.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">48:19</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Gatut: Believe in God, not believe in yourself. You believe in God. Hamid: Your ability to, God put it in you, you supposedly... Dr. Khalifa: (unintelligible)</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">48:27</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Gatut: See, Moses was commanded by God to tell his people to kill their ego, because the ego is the last idol.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">48:33</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">We can say we believe in God. Millions of people who believe in God will not make it. Because they still have something hanging, the stumbling block, and the last stumbling block is the ego.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">48:43</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Gatut: If we cannot accept the word of God as it says in the Quran, .... Hamid: Everything you do consciously, it will count, Hamid: good or bad, it will count against, for you or against you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">48:51</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Hamid: It will credit it in you and nothing to your neighbor, not your brother or father. Hamid: It&#39;s your own account.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">48:56</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Hamid: But, if you don&#39;t do it unconsciously, there is no credit. Hamid: If I Pray, if I&#39;m a good Muslim, because my father told me so, there is no credit for me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">49:06</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">But if I come to the senses that there is such a religion and tells you this, and...</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">49:11</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">and I come to the decision, and got to the point, then there is some credit at the end of the line.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">49:19</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Hamid: But you have to make a decision, it&#39;s a revolving door. It&#39;s a revolving door. Robert: In the Quran, God says &quot;He misguides those who He pleases and guides those who He pleases.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">49:30</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">So, then on the consequence of what you just said, your own common sense, if God guides who He pleases</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">49:35</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">and misguides who He pleases, that&#39;s in the Quran. Hamid: Right. Robert: Is that correct? Hamid: That&#39;s absolutely correct. Robert: So,...</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">49:43</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Hamid: Not in daily basis... Robert: So then, you can throw conscious and common sense right out the window, in a sense.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">49:48</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Robert: Now, except the fact that everything in the Quran and everything does make sense. That&#39;s how God has made it for us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">49:57</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">The whole fact that we don&#39;t believe that God had His only begotten son and sent Him onto this earth, all these</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">&ldquo;You do not test God&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">50:04</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">things that don&#39;t make sense, three people in one, and all this other stuff, that we just believe in God alone. That&#39;s all part of common sense.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">50:12</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">The fact that there are no contradictions in the Quran with science, that it is a perfect book.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">50:18</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">I mean, this is all part of common sense. But when you&#39;re talking about, like, one big decision, it&#39;s whole bunches of decisions, little decisions,</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">50:25</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">which constitute one big decision, whether you believe in God or not. That&#39;s what I was talking about &quot;the covenant&quot;, with your covenant with God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">50:32</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Like when you&#39;re talking about praying or not praying, that&#39;s a decision whether you&#39;re choosing God or Satan. That&#39;s all part of that one big decision.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">50:39</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">So, it comes up time and time and time again. But that&#39;s the only thing that matters. Whether you tell your employees &quot;look, here, this has to be done in one month or not&quot;, and</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">50:50</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">they get kicked out, I mean, that doesn&#39;t make any difference. Hamid: See, God is fair and just. Robert: He controls all that. Hamid: If you are fool enough to go on the roof and then fall down, He&#39;s not gonna do anything. He&#39;s not gonna interfere.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">51:02</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Hamid: If I survive, if I survive, if I survive, if I survive the accident, there is some explanations, physical explanations.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">51:11</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Hamid: It&#39;s not that God&#39;s test. Robert: There is no need to test God. You shouldn&#39;t test...</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">51:17</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">like in the Bible, I don&#39;t know if this is in the Quran, but there is a verse where Jesus is on</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">51:24</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">on the top of the mountain and the devil says &quot;well, if you&#39;re truly &quot;a messenger of God, well, then cast yourself down upon these rocks, because it says that His angels will save you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">51:33</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Robert: And Jesus says &quot;This is not the Word of God.&quot; Dr. Khalifa: You don&#39;t need to test God. Yes. Robert: So, so, it&#39;s all part of being righteous. Dr. Khalifa: Our teacher, next week, is Douglas.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">51:41</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Dr. Khalifa: Douglas Brown. Dr. Khalifa: We&#39;re gonna read Al-F&atilde;tehah for Ali, who help him with his school and some things.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">51:50</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">He requested Al-F&atilde;tehah for... and lucky Farhad Moini, who gets his birthday in the middle of the week, so we&#39;re giving them two F&atilde;tehahs</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">52:01</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">So, we&#39;re gonna pray to God again to give him and his family a great year coming up and happy years after that.</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">52:06</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Al-F&atilde;tehah Bism Allah Arrahman Arraheem (1:1) Al hamdu Lillahi Rabbil &lsquo;Alameen (1:2) Arrahman Arraheem (1:3) Maliki Yawm Eddeen (1:4) Eyyaka Na&rsquo;abudu Wa Eyyaka Nasta&rsquo;aeen (1:5) Ehdina Al-Serata Al-Mustaqeem (1:6) Serata Al-Lazeena An&rsquo;amta &lsquo;Alayhim Ghayri Al-Maghdoobi &lsquo;Alayhim Wa Laddaalleen (1:7)</span></p><p class="c1 c2 c4"><span class="c3">52:24</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c3">Congratulations.
